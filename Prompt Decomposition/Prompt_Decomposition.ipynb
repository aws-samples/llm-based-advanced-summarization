    "# Prompt Decomposition Example\n",
    "This notebook contains examples of prompt decomposition, or taking one long prompt or task and breaking it down into smaller parts.  These smaller parts can then be run independantly, often in parallel, and often on smaller models.  This can lead to significant performance enhancements and cost savings, may increase quality, and will make your prompts much easier to maintain as the workload grows.  This is because each step can be maintained and tested independantly, and can run on different models.  You can also alter any one step without impacting all the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three common times when Prompt Decomposition can be helpful:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1)  Breaking multi-step prompts into a maintainable DAG.  This can be helpful when a prompt reads like code, with a large number of steps or if/then instructions.  Instead, consider breaking these out and generating a flow diagram, resulting in maintainable individual pieces.\n",
    "  2)  Streamlining long linear prompts.  Even where prompts have only a single logical flow, if they are long, it can help to break the flow into small, sequential steps.  These steps combined may execute faster than the long original prompt, and they can also be maintained and tested independently. \n",
    "  3) Preprocessing of RAG or context data.  For example, if context data is large, such as a long support document, consider a prompt that summarizes that content once, then future queries (from the same or different conversations) retrieve the cached summary rather than the long document. \n",
    "  \n",
    "This notebook follows this structure:\n",
    "1) Set up the envionment\n",
    "    * Functions for connecting to Bedrock, including multithreading\n",
    "    * Evaluation functions, for measuring the accuracy of each prompt\n",
    "2) Examples of decomposition\n",
    "    * Task based decomposition\n",
    "    * Volume based decomposition"

    "## 2a) Task Based Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we consider a system that is intended to give recommendations for summer camps.  A parent can send in their child's interests, age, and required date for camp.  The system should then check for avalaible camps for that age and date, and create a recommendation based on the child's interest.  For this example, we are provided a list of 20 summer camps, and a list of 25 potential queries, along with the \"correct\" camp to reccomend for each query.  The correct camps were hand currated by a human, in order to insure they are correct.  Here is a diagram of the basic system:\n",
    "\n",
    "![system](full_task.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And here is a decomposition of the system into three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Decomposed System](decomposed_task.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we've broken the system into 3 steps:\n",
    "1. Extract information, in this case the child's age, the date requests for camp, and the dates and age ranges that camps are offered for.\n",
    "2. Find available camps by matching the child's age and date request to camps that accept that age on that date.\n",
    "3. Based on the list of camps that are available for the child, recommend a camp based on their interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that LLM's are language models, not math models.  Something as simple as \"Is 7 bigger than 3\" should always be done by a program that can do math, and never left to an LLM.  By breaking down the task as shown above, we can do the 2.0 step of finding the correct camps in python, rather than depending on the LLM to calculate ranges.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Skipping to the end, here are our results:\n",
    "\n",
    "![results 1](results_example_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not bad!  Using this method, we are able to rocket accuracy up to 100%, and cut costs as well.\n",
