Mr. Bates denies all the charges, saying the allegations are fabricated and the accusers are lying. Prosecutor Grace Hale told the jury that Mr. Bates invited a 15-year-old boy to his home to view scout camp films but instead showed him pornography and sexually abused him, leaving the boy confused and frightened. Ms. Hale claimed Mr. Bates sexually abused the same boy on several other occasions in his car or cottage. She also said Mr. Bates took a second 13 or 14-year-old boy from the Spalding scout group to London, visited pubs, and later sexually abused him there. Two other boys from the Spalding scout group have also accused Mr. Bates of sexual abuse. The jury heard that Mr. Bates had been in the RAF and then a Lincolnshire police officer from 1976-1983. The trial, expected to last two weeks, continues. According to the additional guidance, the allegations against Mr. Bates were made by four male former scouts from the Spalding scout group he led, who claimed he sexually abused them when they were minors between March 1972 and October 1989. One complainant alleged that when he was 15, Mr. Bates invited him to view cine films from scout camps but instead showed him pornography before sexually abusing him. Another complainant claimed that when he was 13 or 14, Mr. Bates took him to London, visited pubs with him, and then sexually abused him. The guidance indicates that no witnesses were mentioned who could corroborate the complainants' allegations against Mr. Bates. Also, no information was provided on whether Mr. Bates had any prior history of improper conduct outside of the recent allegations made by the four former scouts.

This was the first Category 5 storm to make landfall in Mexico since 1959. The article provides background on how tropical storms are categorized to give context about this storm's severity. \\n\\nThe Saffir-Simpson scale is used to rate tropical storms from 1 to 5 based on maximum sustained wind speed and potential for damage. Category 5 is the highest rating, with winds over 157 mph. Lower categories signify progressively less powerful storms that cause less damage. \\n\\nThis particular storm reached Category 5 status, with winds up to 175 mph. The article explains that no Category 5 storm had directly hit Mexico in over 50 years, since Hurricane Gracie in 1959. This highlights how exceptionally rare and dangerous Hurricane Patricia was. \\n\\nHurricane Patricia made landfall in Jalisco state on Mexico's Pacific coast, bringing torrential rains that caused flooding and mudslides. The storm impacted several coastal communities, causing damage to homes and infrastructure. Preliminary reports indicate that Hurricane Patricia resulted in at least six direct deaths in Mexico. This contrasts with the devastating Hurricane Gracie in 1959 which killed an estimated 1,800 people in Mexico.\\n\\nBy providing details on the Saffir-Simpson scale and historical context about Category 5 storms in Mexico, the article helps readers understand the magnitude of Hurricane Patricia. The storm's high winds and torrential rains caused extensive damage, flooding, and loss of life, especially in coastal areas of Jalisco. Though written for a children's news source, the article uses specific data and background information to emphasize the severity and impact of this major hurricane.\\n\"}, {'document': 'Weaknesses in the way mice swapped data with computers left them vulnerable, said security firm Bastille Networks.\\nAttackers could spoof poorly protected signals letting them use PCs as if they were sitting in front of them, it said.\\nInformation about the loopholes have been passed to the makers of vulnerable mice, some of who are creating updates to make the mice more secure.\\nThe radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a \"dongle\" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research.\\n\"That makes it possible for the attacker to send unencrypted traffic to the dongle pretending to be a keyboard and have it result as keystrokes on your computer,\" Mr Newlin said.\\nBy contrast, they said, signals sent by wireless keyboards were scrambled to stop attackers eavesdropping on or spoofing them.\\nThe pair found they could spoof signals for mice using a few lines of code and an antenna and dongle that cost $20 (Â£15).\\nThe attack worked at distances of up to 180m (590ft).\\nUsing this kit, they sent specially crafted mouse clicks that a computer interpreted as key presses, letting them run commands and take control of a target machine.\\nThe Bastille researchers said many companies spent a lot of time and money securing the physical devices sitting on their networks but often neglected to keep an eye on data sent via radio.\\nWireless mice produced by HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were found to be vulnerable.\\nBastille said it had reported its findings to the hardware makers and to the company that made the chipset used inside the spoofable mice.\\nUpdates to the internal computer code, or firmware, for some of the vulnerable mice are now being made available,\\nBut Bastille said many of the insecure mice it had found could not be updated.', 'summary': 'Hackers could gain access to home and corporate networks via security flaws in wireless mice, suggests research.', 'id': '35890902', 'model_output': \"Recent research has revealed serious vulnerabilities in many popular wireless mice, leaving them open to spoofing attacks that could allow an attacker to remotely control the victim's computer from up to 180 meters away. The radio signals sent between these wireless mice and their USB dongles are often completely unencrypted. By using inexpensive software defined radio equipment costing around $20 and custom code, attackers can spoof the mouse's signals. The attacker's spoofed signals, which mimic a mouse's movement and clicks, are accepted as valid input by the computer. This essentially allows the attacker to remotely control the victim's mouse cursor and send keystroke inputs to their computer as if they were physically using the mouse. \\n\\nTests found wireless mice from major manufacturers like HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were affected. While wireless keyboards scrambled their signals to prevent such spoofing attacks, mice did not have this protection. The root of the problem is that the firmware running on many of these wireless mice lacks encryption, authentication, or other protections to prevent signal spoofing. Some manufacturers have released or are working on firmware updates to address the issue, but many vulnerable mice cannot be updated and will remain insecure indefinitely. Experts advise consumers to be aware of this vulnerability and its potential consequences, and to retire wireless mice that cannot be patched. Manufacturers also need to address firmware weaknesses that left consumers open to such spoofing attacks from afar.

The EC began probing the deal in 2014 after media reports brought the arrangement to light, saying it may break EU rules prohibiting member states from giving tax benefits to selected companies. The EC sent a document to Luxembourg in October 2014 explaining its rationale for the investigation, noting it had no indication the deal was compatible with EU internal market rules. The EC questioned how royalty payments between Amazon firms were calculated and whether Luxembourg may have been too quick in assessing the arrangement before approving it in 2003 without properly reviewing Amazon's proposed money transfers between units or assessing if the regime matched market conditions.

This issue affects wireless mice from major manufacturers like HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell. While many companies have secured devices on their networks, they neglected the wireless data security of these input devices.\\nBastille responsibly disclosed the vulnerabilities to the affected hardware makers.

The vulnerabilities highlight that while there has been a focus on securing physical devices on networks, the wireless signals between devices are often overlooked and left unencrypted.

      "In the early morning hours of Saturday around 4:20am, a fire alarm sounded at the Holiday Inn hotel on Hope Street in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Guests were evacuated from the hotel to find two tour buses parked next to each other completely engulfed in flames. One of the tour groups was from Germany and the other was a joint group from China and Taiwan. Both groups had just arrived in Northern Ireland the previous evening for the start of their tours through the north coast of the country. Many of the tourists' personal belongings that were still on the buses were destroyed in the fire, leaving nothing but burnt out shells. The driver of one of the buses said it seemed the fire began under one bus before quickly spreading to the second. Police were called to the scene and appealed for any information about the incident, believing the fire was likely started deliberately. Inspector David Gibson stated the fire appeared to have begun under one bus initially. Both tour groups were eventually provided replacement coaches so they could proceed, albeit late, with their originally planned tours of Northern Ireland's scenic north coast region. The tourists were shaken by the dramatic start to their visits but thankful no injuries were reported from the alarming early morning bus fire.\n",

      "John Edward Bates, 67, formerly of Spalding, Lincolnshire, now living in London, faces 22 charges including two counts of indecency with a child for alleged offenses that took place between March 1972 and October 1989 when he was a scout leader in South Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire. Mr. Bates denies all the charges, saying the allegations are fabricated and the accusers are lying. Prosecutor Grace Hale told the jury that Mr. Bates invited a 15-year-old boy to his home to view scout camp films but instead showed him pornography and sexually abused him, leaving the boy confused and frightened. Ms. Hale claimed Mr. Bates sexually abused the same boy on several other occasions in his car or cottage. She also said Mr. Bates took a second 13 or 14-year-old boy from the Spalding scout group to London, visited pubs, and later sexually abused him there. Two other boys from the Spalding scout group have also accused Mr. Bates of sexual abuse. The jury heard that Mr. Bates had been in the RAF and then a Lincolnshire police officer from 1976-1983. The trial, expected to last two weeks, continues. According to the additional guidance, the allegations against Mr. Bates were made by four male former scouts from the Spalding scout group he led, who claimed he sexually abused them when they were minors between March 1972 and October 1989. One complainant alleged that when he was 15, Mr. Bates invited him to view cine films from scout camps but instead showed him pornography before sexually abusing him. Another complainant claimed that when he was 13 or 14, Mr. Bates took him to London, visited pubs with him, and then sexually abused him. The guidance indicates that no witnesses were mentioned who could corroborate the complainants' allegations against Mr. Bates. Also, no information was provided on whether Mr. Bates had any prior history of improper conduct outside of the recent allegations made by the four former scouts. The outcome of the trial and any subsequent legal proceedings were not mentioned in the accounts.\n",

      "A Newsround article by reporter Jenny Lawrence discusses Hurricane Patricia, a powerful tropical storm that struck mainland Mexico on October 23, 2015. This was the first Category 5 storm to make landfall in Mexico since 1959. The article provides background on how tropical storms are categorized to give context about this storm's severity. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Saffir-Simpson scale is used to rate tropical storms from 1 to 5 based on maximum sustained wind speed and potential for damage. Category 5 is the highest rating, with winds over 157 mph. Lower categories signify progressively less powerful storms that cause less damage. \n",

      "This particular storm reached Category 5 status, with winds up to 175 mph. The article explains that no Category 5 storm had directly hit Mexico in over 50 years, since Hurricane Gracie in 1959. This highlights how exceptionally rare and dangerous Hurricane Patricia was. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hurricane Patricia made landfall in Jalisco state on Mexico's Pacific coast, bringing torrential rains that caused flooding and mudslides. The storm impacted several coastal communities, causing damage to homes and infrastructure. Preliminary reports indicate that Hurricane Patricia resulted in at least six direct deaths in Mexico. This contrasts with the devastating Hurricane Gracie in 1959 which killed an estimated 1,800 people in Mexico.\n",
      "\n",
      "By providing details on the Saffir-Simpson scale and historical context about Category 5 storms in Mexico, the article helps readers understand the magnitude of Hurricane Patricia.

      "Attackers could spoof poorly protected signals letting them use PCs as if they were sitting in front of them, it said.\n",
      "Information about the loopholes have been passed to the makers of vulnerable mice, some of who are creating updates to make the mice more secure.\n",
      "The radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a \"dongle\" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research.\n",
      "\"That makes it possible for the attacker to send unencrypted traffic to the dongle pretending to be a keyboard and have it result as keystrokes on your computer,\" Mr Newlin said.\n",
      "By contrast, they said, signals sent by wireless keyboards were scrambled to stop attackers eavesdropping on or spoofing them.\n",
      "The pair found they could spoof signals for mice using a few lines of code and an antenna and dongle that cost $20 (Â£15).\n",
      "The attack worked at distances of up to 180m (590ft).\n",
      "Using this kit, they sent specially crafted mouse clicks that a computer interpreted as key presses, letting them run commands and take control of a target machine.\n",
      "The Bastille researchers said many companies spent a lot of time and money securing the physical devices sitting on their networks but often neglected to keep an eye on data sent via radio.\n",
      "Wireless mice produced by HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were found to be vulnerable.\n",
      "Bastille said it had reported its findings to the hardware makers and to the company that made the chipset used inside the spoofable mice.\n",
      "Updates to the internal computer code, or firmware, for some of the vulnerable mice are now being made available,\n",
      "But Bastille said many of the insecure mice it had found could not be updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Model Summary:\n",
      "Recent research has revealed serious vulnerabilities in many popular wireless mice, leaving them open to spoofing attacks that could allow an attacker to remotely control the victim's computer from up to 180 meters away. The radio signals sent between these wireless mice and their USB dongles are often completely unencrypted. By using inexpensive software defined radio equipment costing around $20 and custom code, attackers can spoof the mouse's signals. The attacker's spoofed signals, which mimic a mouse's movement and clicks, are accepted as valid input by the computer. This essentially allows the attacker to remotely control the victim's mouse cursor and send keystroke inputs to their computer as if they were physically using the mouse. \n",
      "\n",
      "Tests found wireless mice from major manufacturers like HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were affected. While wireless keyboards scrambled their signals to prevent such spoofing attacks, mice did not have this protection. The root of the problem is that the firmware running on many of these wireless mice lacks encryption, authentication, or other protections to prevent signal spoofing. Some manufacturers have released or are working on firmware updates to address the issue, but many vulnerable mice cannot be updated and will remain insecure indefinitely. Experts advise consumers to be aware of this vulnerability and its potential consequences, and to retire wireless mice that cannot be patched. Manufacturers also need to address firmware weaknesses that left consumers open to such spoofing attacks from afar. The researchers responsibly disclosed the issues to the vendors prior to publication.\n",

      "Model Summary:\n",
      "The European Commission (EC) has doubts about a tax arrangement between Amazon and Luxembourg from 2003, saying its preliminary view is that the tax ruling constitutes illegal state aid to Amazon. The 2003 deal was approved when Jean-Claude Juncker, the current EC president, was Luxembourg's prime minister. The deal allowed Amazon to route profits through Luxembourg and pay little or no taxes. The EC began probing the deal in 2014 after media reports brought the arrangement to light, saying it may break EU rules prohibiting member states from giving tax benefits to selected companies. The EC sent a document to Luxembourg in October 2014 explaining its rationale for the investigation, noting it had no indication the deal was compatible with EU internal market rules. The EC questioned how royalty payments between Amazon firms were calculated and whether Luxembourg may have been too quick in assessing the arrangement before approving it in 2003 without properly reviewing Amazon's proposed money transfers between units or assessing if the regime matched market conditions. Luxembourg's finance ministry contends it cooperated fully and disclosed detailed reports as requested during the investigation. While the current status and any resolutions from the probe are unclear, Amazon and Luxembourg assert the 2003 tax arrangement was legal and did not constitute state aid. Luxembourg is also being probed over similar deals with Fiat and other countries like Ireland and the Netherlands face scrutiny over tax arrangements with Apple, Starbucks and other companies.\n",

      "The 148th annual Balmoral Show took place over 3 days at Balmoral Park near Lisburn, celebrating the best of Northern Irish farming, food, and family entertainment. Run by the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society (RUAS), the show moved from Belfast to its current location in 2013. This year's event coincided with Northern Ireland's Year of Food and Drink, so there was special emphasis on promoting local produce and agriculture. One of the highlights was an \"edible garden\" where plants grew before visitors' eyes and featured innovative ways to grow food. The heart of the show was the livestock competitions, where breeders and handlers showed off prize-winning pigs, cattle, poultry, ponies and horses. Sheep shearing contests and horse riding and show jumping competitions demonstrated important farmer skills. The family fun area included falconry displays by the Northern Ireland School of Falconry, gun dog skills demonstrations showing the talents of highly trained canines, and a performance by balloon artist Bruce Airhead who twisted balloons into fun shapes and characters. On the middle day of the show, Wednesday, BBC News NI covered the event live on social media. Over its long history, the 3-day Balmoral Show has become a beloved tradition, allowing the public to appreciate and support the essential work of Northern Ireland's farmers and food producers. With local livestock, produce, demonstrations, and special exhibits, the annual show offered something for everyone interested in Northern Irish agriculture and culture.\n",

Byrne originally joined the Dragons in 2015 after playing for Wasps and has made 36 appearances for the team over two seasons. In December 2016, he signed a contract extension to remain with the Dragons. However, this latest knee injury comes as a major setback. Forwards coach Ceri Jones called Byrne's injury a \"big blow\" since he has been \"excellent all year\" and really stepped up as a key player. While disappointing, Jones said Byrne's absence provides opportunities for other talented back row players to shine, like Ollie Griffiths, Harrison Keddie, and James Thomas. Jones specifically highlighted Keddie, saying he has shown glimpses of brilliance all season and now has a chance to really thrive in an expanded role. The Dragons have a big match coming up against Munster in the Pro12 this Friday, but will have to play without Byrne, who will miss the remainder of the season rehabbing his injured knee. This is a tough loss for the Dragons as Byrne had become a standout player, but the coaching staff hopes his teammates will rise to the occasion in his absence. Byrne originally joined the Dragons in 2015 after having previously played for Wasps. Over his two seasons with the Dragons, Byrne has made 36 appearances and had signed a contract extension in December 2016 to remain with the team. Forwards coach Ceri Jones acknowledged that Byrne's season-ending knee injury is a major setback and \"big blow\" to the team, as Byrne had been an integral player this season. While Byrne will be missed in the upcoming match against Munster, his injury provides an opportunity for other talented back row players like Ollie Griffiths, Harrison Keddie, and James Thomas to step up. Jones singled out Keddie as someone who has shown brilliance this season and can now take on an expanded role. The loss of veteran Byrne is disappointing for the Dragons, but the team hopes his teammates will rise to the challenge.\n",

The town of Newton Stewart in Dumfries and Galloway was badly affected after the River Cree overflowed, flooding homes and businesses. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited Newton Stewart to see the damage. In Hawick, repair work is still ongoing after flooding. Roads remain closed in the Peeblesshire area due to standing water. Trains on the west coast mainline were disrupted after damage to Lamington Viaduct. The Scottish Borders region has also been impacted, with Peebles particularly affected. Flood alerts remain in place across the Borders amid further rain. Scottish Borders Council has listed roads closed by the flooding and urged drivers to obey closures. Labour MSP Alex Rowley visited Hawick and said immediate flood protection steps are needed for vulnerable areas, along with a clear timetable for further prevention measures. Overall, flooding has caused significant disruption and damage across southern Scotland, with Newton Stewart, Hawick, Peeblesshire and the Scottish Borders among the worst affected areas.\n",

      "Weaknesses in the way mice swapped data with computers left them vulnerable, said security firm Bastille Networks.\n",
      "Attackers could spoof poorly protected signals letting them use PCs as if they were sitting in front of them, it said.\n",
      "Information about the loopholes have been passed to the makers of vulnerable mice, some of who are creating updates to make the mice more secure.\n",
      "The radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a \"dongle\" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research.\n",
      "\"That makes it possible for the attacker to send unencrypted traffic to the dongle pretending to be a keyboard and have it result as keystrokes on your computer,\" Mr Newlin said.\n",
      "By contrast, they said, signals sent by wireless keyboards were scrambled to stop attackers eavesdropping on or spoofing them.\n",
      "The pair found they could spoof signals for mice using a few lines of code and an antenna and dongle that cost $20 (Â£15).\n",
      "The attack worked at distances of up to 180m (590ft).\n",
      "Using this kit, they sent specially crafted mouse clicks that a computer interpreted as key presses, letting them run commands and take control of a target machine.\n",
      "The Bastille researchers said many companies spent a lot of time and money securing the physical devices sitting on their networks but often neglected to keep an eye on data sent via radio.\n",

      "A security firm called Bastille Networks recently discovered vulnerabilities in how wireless mice communicate with computers. The radio signals sent from many wireless mice to a USB dongle were often unencrypted, allowing attackers to spoof the signals and essentially pretend to be the mouse. By spoofing mouse clicks, the attackers could run commands and control the target computer as if they were sitting right in front of it. \n",
      "Bastille researchers were able to demonstrate this attack using just $20 of equipment and some custom code, with the spoofed signals working at distances up to 180 meters away. This issue affects wireless mice from major manufacturers like HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell. While many companies have secured devices on their networks, they neglected the wireless data security of these input devices.\n",
      "Bastille responsibly disclosed the vulnerabilities to the affected hardware makers. Some have released firmware updates to fix the issue, but many of the vulnerable mice cannot be updated.

      "Mr Mosley - the son of 1930s fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley - won Â£60,000 after a judge ruled there was no substance to the allegation that there had been a Nazi theme to the sex party and found that his privacy had been breached.\n",
