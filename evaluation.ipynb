The driver shared that both groups were able to get replacement coaches and will proceed with their planned tours of Northern Ireland's north coast, though on a delayed schedule. Police suspect the fire was deliberately set and have appealed to the public for any information related to the incident. Inspector David Gibson stated that the fire seemed to originate under one bus before spreading to the second. In total, the detailed account indicates that an intentionally-set fire damaged two tour buses outside a Belfast hotel, destroying tourist belongings and disrupting the travel plans of two visiting groups on their first night in Northern Ireland. Specifically, the fire alarm at the Holiday Inn was triggered when a blaze broke out in the hotel's car park, completely engulfing two tour buses parked next to each other. The buses contained luggage and personal items belonging to tourists from Germany and from China/Taiwan who were spending their first night in Northern Ireland. The fire, which police believe was deliberately started underneath one of the buses before spreading, forced the groups to find replacement transportation so they could proceed with their planned tours of the north coast, now slightly delayed.\"}, {'document': 'Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\".\\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \"did a good job and I didn\\'t\".\\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari\\'s pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\\nVettel said: \"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow.

Overall, this October 2015 storm was historic as the first Category 5 hurricane to make landfall in Mexico since 1959, bringing destructive winds, rain and flooding.'}, {'document': 'Weaknesses in the way mice swapped data with computers left them vulnerable, said security firm Bastille Networks.\\nAttackers could spoof poorly protected signals letting them use PCs as if they were sitting in front of them, it said.\\nInformation about the loopholes have been passed to the makers of vulnerable mice, some of who are creating updates to make the mice more secure.\\nThe radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a \"dongle\" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research.\\n\"That makes it possible for the attacker to send unencrypted traffic to the dongle pretending to be a keyboard and have it result as keystrokes on your computer,\" Mr Newlin said.\\nBy contrast, they said, signals sent by wireless keyboards were scrambled to stop attackers eavesdropping on or spoofing them.\\nThe pair found they could spoof signals for mice using a few lines of code and an antenna and dongle that cost $20 (Â£15).\\nThe attack worked at distances of up to 180m (590ft).\\nUsing this kit, they sent specially crafted mouse clicks that a computer interpreted as key presses, letting them run commands and take control of a target machine.\\nThe Bastille researchers said many companies spent a lot of time and money securing the physical devices sitting on their networks but often neglected to keep an eye on data sent via radio.\\nWireless mice produced by HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were found to be vulnerable.\\nBastille said it had reported its findings to the hardware makers and to the company that made the chipset used inside the spoofable mice.\\nUpdates to the internal computer code, or firmware, for some of the vulnerable mice are now being made available,\\nBut Bastille said many of the insecure mice it had found could not be updated.', 'summary': 'Hackers could gain access to home and corporate networks via security flaws in wireless mice, suggests research.', 'id': '35890902', 'model_output': 'Researchers from security firm Bastille Networks discovered serious vulnerabilities in wireless mice that could allow attackers to remotely take control of computers.

By spoofing the mouse\\'s movements, attackers could remotely send malicious clicks and keystrokes to the target computer, potentially running commands and installing malware. \\n\\nThe vulnerabilities affected wireless mice from major manufacturers including HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell. The root issue was poor encryption of the wireless signals between mice and dongles. The researchers found that the mice fail to implement encryption, authentication or frequency hopping, leaving them open to relatively simple spoofing attacks. Bastille responsibly disclosed the flaws to the affected vendors. Some companies like HP and Lenovo have released firmware updates to address the problems. However, many vulnerable mice cannot be patched since they lack firmware upgrade capabilities.\\n\\nBastille recommends that wireless mouse users switch to more secure models that encrypt signals between devices. For high security settings, wired mice may be preferable. Since millions of wireless mice are affected globally, Bastille warns that the flaws could be exploited for widespread \"mousejacking\" attacks. They advise consumers and organizations to check their wireless mice models and apply any available firmware updates as soon as possible. Vendors are releasing firmware updates for some vulnerable models, but many existing wireless mice cannot be patched. Users should check with manufacturers to determine if their devices are susceptible and can be updated. Otherwise, the only option may be to replace wireless mice that could be exploited in this manner.
