      "[{'summary': 'Tulkinghorn and Krook find Nemo dead, apparently from an overdose of opium. Krook claims no knowledge of Mr. Nemo\\'s identity or habits, and is chagrined because Nemo owes him six weeks\\' rent. Dr. Woodcourt (though he is not named immediately) arrives on the scene and reveals that Nemo has bought opium from him for a year and a half. Tulkinghorn learns from the ragamuffin Jo, a crossing-sweeper, that Nemo was a kind man, and gave Jo money when he had it. \"He wos wery good to me, he wos!\"\\n\\nAn inquest is held regarding Nemo\\'s death, a silly proceeding in a tavern complete with a comic vocalist, and he is officially found dead by accident. Since Nemo had no money or family, he is buried in a pauper\\'s grave.\\n\\nIn Chapter 12, the scene returns to Chesney Wold. The Dedlocks have returned, and have guests. Meanwhile Lady Dedlock continues to suffer ennui. Lady Dedlock meets the young maid Rosa for the first time, and takes a liking to her. This causes jealousy to arise in Lady Dedlock\\'s personal lady\\'s maid, Mademoiselle Hortense.\\n\\nTulkinghorn comes to Chesney Wold to inform Sir Leicester of the lawsuit brought upon him by his neighbor Boythorn. Tulkinghorn also has a message for Lady Dedlock concerning Nemo, whose handwriting was on the paper she had such interest in the last time he was at Chesney Wold, and tells of the law writer\\'s death. She pretends that the death doesn\\'t especially concern her; Tulkinghorn, unfooled, sees otherwise. The rest of the visit Lady Dedlock and Tulkinghorn watch each other carefully and surreptitiously.\\n\\nIn Chapter 13 Richard\\'s future is under futher discussion. His education has been soley the Classics (meaning, in those days, ancient Latin and Greek literature). Richard knows nothing about what he would like to do, except that he doesn\\'t want to become a minister in the Church of England. Mr. Jarndyce suggest the medical profession, and Richard quickly (too quickly) seizes upon the idea.\\n\\nMr. Boythorn -- along with Mr. Kenge, who is also present -- is enthusiastic about Richard\\'s proposed medical career and propounds the maltreatment of doctors aboard Navy ships. The men discuss how Richard is to be gotten into the profession, and Mr. Kenge plans for his cousin, Dr. Bayham Badger, to take Richard as an apprentice.\\n\\nAs Mr. Badger lives in London, the party goes to London a few weeks later to get Richard settled. In London, Esther attends the theatre and is followed and stared at by the lovestruck Mr. Guppy. Ada and Richard\\'s romance continues to blossom.\\n\\nAt Mr. Badger\\'s house the party meets Dr. Allan Woodcourt, and Esther finds him attractive. The talk at the Badgers\\' is of an unconventional kind -- namely the wealth and prestige of Mrs. Badgers two deceased husbands. Esther tells Mr. Jarndyce that Ada and Richard are in love, but he advises the lovers that because they are too young, and because Richard is not yet established, they should wait to be married. ', 'text': 'A touch on the lawyer\\'s wrinkled hand as he stands in the dark room,\\nirresolute, makes him start and say, \"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s me,\" returns the old man of the house, whose breath is in his\\near. \"Can\\'t you wake him?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"What have you done with your candle?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s gone out. Here it is.\"\\n\\nKrook takes it, goes to the fire, stoops over the red embers, and\\ntries to get a light. The dying ashes have no light to spare, and his\\nendeavours are vain. Muttering, after an ineffectual call to his\\nlodger, that he will go downstairs and bring a lighted candle from\\nthe shop, the old man departs. Mr. Tulkinghorn, for some new reason\\nthat he has, does not await his return in the room, but on the stairs\\noutside.\\n\\nThe welcome light soon shines upon the wall, as Krook comes slowly up\\nwith his green-eyed cat following at his heels. \"Does the man\\ngenerally sleep like this?\" inquired the lawyer in a low voice. \"Hi!\\nI don\\'t know,\" says Krook, shaking his head and lifting his eyebrows.\\n\"I know next to nothing of his habits except that he keeps himself\\nvery close.\"\\n\\nThus whispering, they both go in together. As the light goes in, the\\ngreat eyes in the shutters, darkening, seem to close. Not so the eyes\\nupon the bed.\\n\\n\"God save us!\" exclaims Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"He is dead!\" Krook drops\\nthe heavy hand he has taken up so suddenly that the arm swings over\\nthe bedside.\\n\\nThey look at one another for a moment.\\n\\n\"Send for some doctor! Call for Miss Flite up the stairs, sir. Here\\'s\\npoison by the bed! Call out for Flite, will you?\" says Krook, with\\nhis lean hands spread out above the body like a vampire\\'s wings.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn hurries to the landing and calls, \"Miss Flite! Flite!\\nMake haste, here, whoever you are! Flite!\" Krook follows him with his\\neyes, and while he is calling, finds opportunity to steal to the old\\nportmanteau and steal back again.\\n\\n\"Run, Flite, run! The nearest doctor! Run!\" So Mr. Krook addresses a\\ncrazy little woman who is his female lodger, who appears and vanishes\\nin a breath, who soon returns accompanied by a testy medical man\\nbrought from his dinner, with a broad, snuffy upper lip and a broad\\nScotch tongue.\\n\\n\"Ey! Bless the hearts o\\' ye,\" says the medical man, looking up at\\nthem after a moment\\'s examination. \"He\\'s just as dead as Phairy!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn (standing by the old portmanteau) inquires if he has\\nbeen dead any time.\\n\\n\"Any time, sir?\" says the medical gentleman. \"It\\'s probable he wull\\nhave been dead aboot three hours.\"\\n\\n\"About that time, I should say,\" observes a dark young man on the\\nother side of the bed.\\n\\n\"Air you in the maydickle prayfession yourself, sir?\" inquires the\\nfirst.\\n\\nThe dark young man says yes.\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll just tak\\' my depairture,\" replies the other, \"for I\\'m nae\\ngude here!\" With which remark he finishes his brief attendance and\\nreturns to finish his dinner.\\n\\nThe dark young surgeon passes the candle across and across the face\\nand carefully examines the law-writer, who has established his\\npretensions to his name by becoming indeed No one.\\n\\n\"I knew this person by sight very well,\" says he. \"He has purchased\\nopium of me for the last year and a half. Was anybody present related\\nto him?\" glancing round upon the three bystanders.\\n\\n\"I was his landlord,\" grimly answers Krook, taking the candle from\\nthe surgeon\\'s outstretched hand. \"He told me once I was the nearest\\nrelation he had.\"\\n\\n\"He has died,\" says the surgeon, \"of an over-dose of opium, there is\\nno doubt. The room is strongly flavoured with it. There is enough\\nhere now,\" taking an old tea-pot from Mr. Krook, \"to kill a dozen\\npeople.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think he did it on purpose?\" asks Krook.\\n\\n\"Took the over-dose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes!\" Krook almost smacks his lips with the unction of a horrible\\ninterest.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t say. I should think it unlikely, as he has been in the habit\\nof taking so much. But nobody can tell. He was very poor, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"I suppose he was. His room--don\\'t look rich,\" says Krook, who might\\nhave changed eyes with his cat, as he casts his sharp glance around.\\n\"But I have never been in it since he had it, and he was too close to\\nname his circumstances to me.\"\\n\\n\"Did he owe you any rent?\"\\n\\n\"Six weeks.\"\\n\\n\"He will never pay it!\" says the young man, resuming his examination.\\n\"It is beyond a doubt that he is indeed as dead as Pharaoh; and to\\njudge from his appearance and condition, I should think it a happy\\nrelease. Yet he must have been a good figure when a youth, and I dare\\nsay, good-looking.\" He says this, not unfeelingly, while sitting on\\nthe bedstead\\'s edge with his face towards that other face and his\\nhand upon the region of the heart. \"I recollect once thinking there\\nwas something in his manner, uncouth as it was, that denoted a fall\\nin life. Was that so?\" he continues, looking round.\\n\\nKrook replies, \"You might as well ask me to describe the ladies whose\\nheads of hair I have got in sacks downstairs. Than that he was my\\nlodger for a year and a half and lived--or didn\\'t live--by\\nlaw-writing, I know no more of him.\"\\n\\nDuring this dialogue Mr. Tulkinghorn has stood aloof by the old\\nportmanteau, with his hands behind him, equally removed, to all\\nappearance, from all three kinds of interest exhibited near the\\nbed--from the young surgeon\\'s professional interest in death,\\nnoticeable as being quite apart from his remarks on the deceased as\\nan individual; from the old man\\'s unction; and the little crazy\\nwoman\\'s awe. His imperturbable face has been as inexpressive as his\\nrusty clothes. One could not even say he has been thinking all this\\nwhile. He has shown neither patience nor impatience, nor attention\\nnor abstraction. He has shown nothing but his shell. As easily might\\nthe tone of a delicate musical instrument be inferred from its case,\\nas the tone of Mr. Tulkinghorn from his case.\\n\\nHe now interposes, addressing the young surgeon in his unmoved,\\nprofessional way.\\n\\n\"I looked in here,\" he observes, \"just before you, with the\\nintention of giving this deceased man, whom I never saw alive, some\\nemployment at his trade of copying. I had heard of him from my\\nstationer--Snagsby of Cook\\'s Court. Since no one here knows anything\\nabout him, it might be as well to send for Snagsby. Ah!\" to the\\nlittle crazy woman, who has often seen him in court, and whom he has\\noften seen, and who proposes, in frightened dumb-show, to go for the\\nlaw-stationer. \"Suppose you do!\"\\n\\nWhile she is gone, the surgeon abandons his hopeless investigation\\nand covers its subject with the patchwork counterpane. Mr. Krook and\\nhe interchange a word or two. Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing, but\\nstands, ever, near the old portmanteau.\\n\\nMr. Snagsby arrives hastily in his grey coat and his black sleeves.\\n\"Dear me, dear me,\" he says; \"and it has come to this, has it! Bless\\nmy soul!\"\\n\\n\"Can you give the person of the house any information about this\\nunfortunate creature, Snagsby?\" inquires Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"He was in\\narrears with his rent, it seems. And he must be buried, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby, coughing his apologetic cough behind\\nhis hand, \"I really don\\'t know what advice I could offer, except\\nsending for the beadle.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t speak of advice,\" returns Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"I could\\nadvise--\"\\n\\n\"No one better, sir, I am sure,\" says Mr. Snagsby, with his\\ndeferential cough.\\n\\n\"I speak of affording some clue to his connexions, or to where he\\ncame from, or to anything concerning him.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby after prefacing his reply with\\nhis cough of general propitiation, \"that I no more know where he came\\nfrom than I know--\"\\n\\n\"Where he has gone to, perhaps,\" suggests the surgeon to help him\\nout.\\n\\nA pause. Mr. Tulkinghorn looking at the law-stationer. Mr. Krook,\\nwith his mouth open, looking for somebody to speak next.\\n\\n\"As to his connexions, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby, \"if a person was to\\nsay to me, \\'Snagsby, here\\'s twenty thousand pound down, ready for you\\nin the Bank of England if you\\'ll only name one of \\'em,\\' I couldn\\'t do\\nit, sir! About a year and a half ago--to the best of my belief, at\\nthe time when he first came to lodge at the present rag and bottle\\nshop--\"\\n\\n\"That was the time!\" says Krook with a nod.\\n\\n\"About a year and a half ago,\" says Mr. Snagsby, strengthened, \"he\\ncame into our place one morning after breakfast, and finding my\\nlittle woman (which I name Mrs. Snagsby when I use that appellation)\\nin our shop, produced a specimen of his handwriting and gave her to\\nunderstand that he was in want of copying work to do and was, not to\\nput too fine a point upon it,\" a favourite apology for plain speaking\\nwith Mr. Snagsby, which he always offers with a sort of argumentative\\nfrankness, \"hard up! My little woman is not in general partial to\\nstrangers, particular--not to put too fine a point upon it--when they\\nwant anything. But she was rather took by something about this\\nperson, whether by his being unshaved, or by his hair being in want\\nof attention, or by what other ladies\\' reasons, I leave you to judge;\\nand she accepted of the specimen, and likewise of the address. My\\nlittle woman hasn\\'t a good ear for names,\" proceeds Mr. Snagsby after\\nconsulting his cough of consideration behind his hand, \"and she\\nconsidered Nemo equally the same as Nimrod. In consequence of which,\\nshe got into a habit of saying to me at meals, \\'Mr. Snagsby, you\\nhaven\\'t found Nimrod any work yet!\\' or \\'Mr. Snagsby, why didn\\'t you\\ngive that eight and thirty Chancery folio in Jarndyce to Nimrod?\\' or\\nsuch like. And that is the way he gradually fell into job-work at our\\nplace; and that is the most I know of him except that he was a quick\\nhand, and a hand not sparing of night-work, and that if you gave him\\nout, say, five and forty folio on the Wednesday night, you would have\\nit brought in on the Thursday morning. All of which--\" Mr. Snagsby\\nconcludes by politely motioning with his hat towards the bed, as much\\nas to add, \"I have no doubt my honourable friend would confirm if he\\nwere in a condition to do it.\"\\n\\n\"Hadn\\'t you better see,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn to Krook, \"whether he\\nhad any papers that may enlighten you? There will be an inquest, and\\nyou will be asked the question. You can read?\"\\n\\n\"No, I can\\'t,\" returns the old man with a sudden grin.\\n\\n\"Snagsby,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, \"look over the room for him. He will\\nget into some trouble or difficulty otherwise. Being here, I\\'ll wait\\nif you make haste, and then I can testify on his behalf, if it should\\never be necessary, that all was fair and right. If you will hold the\\ncandle for Mr. Snagsby, my friend, he\\'ll soon see whether there is\\nanything to help you.\"\\n\\n\"In the first place, here\\'s an old portmanteau, sir,\" says Snagsby.\\n\\nAh, to be sure, so there is! Mr. Tulkinghorn does not appear to have\\nseen it before, though he is standing so close to it, and though\\nthere is very little else, heaven knows.\\n\\nThe marine-store merchant holds the light, and the law-stationer\\nconducts the search. The surgeon leans against the corner of the\\nchimney-piece; Miss Flite peeps and trembles just within the door.\\nThe apt old scholar of the old school, with his dull black breeches\\ntied with ribbons at the knees, his large black waistcoat, his\\nlong-sleeved black coat, and his wisp of limp white neckerchief tied\\nin the bow the peerage knows so well, stands in exactly the same\\nplace and attitude.\\n\\nThere are some worthless articles of clothing in the old portmanteau;\\nthere is a bundle of pawnbrokers\\' duplicates, those turnpike tickets\\non the road of poverty; there is a crumpled paper, smelling of opium,\\non which are scrawled rough memoranda--as, took, such a day, so many\\ngrains; took, such another day, so many more--begun some time ago, as\\nif with the intention of being regularly continued, but soon left\\noff. There are a few dirty scraps of newspapers, all referring to\\ncoroners\\' inquests; there is nothing else. They search the cupboard\\nand the drawer of the ink-splashed table. There is not a morsel of an\\nold letter or of any other writing in either. The young surgeon\\nexamines the dress on the law-writer. A knife and some odd halfpence\\nare all he finds. Mr. Snagsby\\'s suggestion is the practical\\nsuggestion after all, and the beadle must be called in.\\n\\nSo the little crazy lodger goes for the beadle, and the rest come out\\nof the room. \"Don\\'t leave the cat there!\" says the surgeon; \"that\\nwon\\'t do!\" Mr. Krook therefore drives her out before him, and she\\ngoes furtively downstairs, winding her lithe tail and licking her\\nlips.\\n\\n\"Good night!\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, and goes home to Allegory and\\nmeditation.\\n\\nBy this time the news has got into the court. Groups of its\\ninhabitants assemble to discuss the thing, and the outposts of the\\narmy of observation (principally boys) are pushed forward to Mr.\\nKrook\\'s window, which they closely invest. A policeman has already\\nwalked up to the room, and walked down again to the door, where he\\nstands like a tower, only condescending to see the boys at his base\\noccasionally; but whenever he does see them, they quail and fall\\nback. Mrs. Perkins, who has not been for some weeks on speaking terms\\nwith Mrs. Piper in consequence for an unpleasantness originating in\\nyoung Perkins\\' having \"fetched\" young Piper \"a crack,\" renews her\\nfriendly intercourse on this auspicious occasion. The potboy at the\\ncorner, who is a privileged amateur, as possessing official knowledge\\nof life and having to deal with drunken men occasionally, exchanges\\nconfidential communications with the policeman and has the appearance\\nof an impregnable youth, unassailable by truncheons and unconfinable\\nin station-houses. People talk across the court out of window, and\\nbare-headed scouts come hurrying in from Chancery Lane to know what\\'s\\nthe matter. The general feeling seems to be that it\\'s a blessing Mr.\\nKrook warn\\'t made away with first, mingled with a little natural\\ndisappointment that he was not. In the midst of this sensation, the\\nbeadle arrives.\\n\\nThe beadle, though generally understood in the neighbourhood to be a\\nridiculous institution, is not without a certain popularity for the\\nmoment, if it were only as a man who is going to see the body. The\\npoliceman considers him an imbecile civilian, a remnant of the\\nbarbarous watchmen times, but gives him admission as something that\\nmust be borne with until government shall abolish him. The sensation\\nis heightened as the tidings spread from mouth to mouth that the\\nbeadle is on the ground and has gone in.\\n\\nBy and by the beadle comes out, once more intensifying the sensation,\\nwhich has rather languished in the interval. He is understood to be\\nin want of witnesses for the inquest to-morrow who can tell the\\ncoroner and jury anything whatever respecting the deceased. Is\\nimmediately referred to innumerable people who can tell nothing\\nwhatever. Is made more imbecile by being constantly informed that\\nMrs. Green\\'s son \"was a law-writer his-self and knowed him better\\nthan anybody,\" which son of Mrs. Green\\'s appears, on inquiry, to be\\nat the present time aboard a vessel bound for China, three months\\nout, but considered accessible by telegraph on application to the\\nLords of the Admiralty. Beadle goes into various shops and parlours,\\nexamining the inhabitants, always shutting the door first, and by\\nexclusion, delay, and general idiotcy exasperating the public.\\nPoliceman seen to smile to potboy. Public loses interest and\\nundergoes reaction. Taunts the beadle in shrill youthful voices with\\nhaving boiled a boy, choruses fragments of a popular song to that\\neffect and importing that the boy was made into soup for the\\nworkhouse. Policeman at last finds it necessary to support the law\\nand seize a vocalist, who is released upon the flight of the rest on\\ncondition of his getting out of this then, come, and cutting it--a\\ncondition he immediately observes. So the sensation dies off for the\\ntime; and the unmoved policeman (to whom a little opium, more or\\nless, is nothing), with his shining hat, stiff stock, inflexible\\ngreat-coat, stout belt and bracelet, and all things fitting, pursues\\nhis lounging way with a heavy tread, beating the palms of his white\\ngloves one against the other and stopping now and then at a\\nstreet-corner to look casually about for anything between a lost\\nchild and a murder.\\n\\nUnder cover of the night, the feeble-minded beadle comes flitting\\nabout Chancery Lane with his summonses, in which every juror\\'s name\\nis wrongly spelt, and nothing rightly spelt but the beadle\\'s own\\nname, which nobody can read or wants to know. The summonses served\\nand his witnesses forewarned, the beadle goes to Mr. Krook\\'s to keep\\na small appointment he has made with certain paupers, who, presently\\narriving, are conducted upstairs, where they leave the great eyes in\\nthe shutter something new to stare at, in that last shape which\\nearthly lodgings take for No one--and for Every one.\\n\\nAnd all that night the coffin stands ready by the old portmanteau;\\nand the lonely figure on the bed, whose path in life has lain through\\nfive and forty years, lies there with no more track behind him that\\nany one can trace than a deserted infant.\\n\\nNext day the court is all alive--is like a fair, as Mrs. Perkins,\\nmore than reconciled to Mrs. Piper, says in amicable conversation\\nwith that excellent woman. The coroner is to sit in the first-floor\\nroom at the Sol\\'s Arms, where the Harmonic Meetings take place twice\\na week and where the chair is filled by a gentleman of professional\\ncelebrity, faced by Little Swills, the comic vocalist, who hopes\\n(according to the bill in the window) that his friends will rally\\nround him and support first-rate talent. The Sol\\'s Arms does a brisk\\nstroke of business all the morning. Even children so require\\nsustaining under the general excitement that a pieman who has\\nestablished himself for the occasion at the corner of the court says\\nhis brandy-balls go off like smoke. What time the beadle, hovering\\nbetween the door of Mr. Krook\\'s establishment and the door of the\\nSol\\'s Arms, shows the curiosity in his keeping to a few discreet\\nspirits and accepts the compliment of a glass of ale or so in return.\\n\\nAt the appointed hour arrives the coroner, for whom the jurymen are\\nwaiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good\\ndry skittle-ground attached to the Sol\\'s Arms. The coroner frequents\\nmore public-houses than any man alive. The smell of sawdust, beer,\\ntobacco-smoke, and spirits is inseparable in his vocation from death\\nin its most awful shapes. He is conducted by the beadle and the\\nlandlord to the Harmonic Meeting Room, where he puts his hat on the\\npiano and takes a Windsor-chair at the head of a long table formed of\\nseveral short tables put together and ornamented with glutinous rings\\nin endless involutions, made by pots and glasses. As many of the jury\\nas can crowd together at the table sit there. The rest get among the\\nspittoons and pipes or lean against the piano. Over the coroner\\'s\\nhead is a small iron garland, the pendant handle of a bell, which\\nrather gives the majesty of the court the appearance of going to be\\nhanged presently.\\n\\nCall over and swear the jury! While the ceremony is in progress,\\nsensation is created by the entrance of a chubby little man in a\\nlarge shirt-collar, with a moist eye and an inflamed nose, who\\nmodestly takes a position near the door as one of the general public,\\nbut seems familiar with the room too. A whisper circulates that this\\nis Little Swills. It is considered not unlikely that he will get up\\nan imitation of the coroner and make it the principal feature of the\\nHarmonic Meeting in the evening.\\n\\n\"Well, gentlemen--\" the coroner begins.\\n\\n\"Silence there, will you!\" says the beadle. Not to the coroner,\\nthough it might appear so.\\n\\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" resumes the coroner. \"You are impanelled here to\\ninquire into the death of a certain man. Evidence will be given\\nbefore you as to the circumstances attending that death, and you will\\ngive your verdict according to the--skittles; they must be stopped,\\nyou know, beadle!--evidence, and not according to anything else. The\\nfirst thing to be done is to view the body.\"\\n\\n\"Make way there!\" cries the beadle.\\n\\nSo they go out in a loose procession, something after the manner of a\\nstraggling funeral, and make their inspection in Mr. Krook\\'s back\\nsecond floor, from which a few of the jurymen retire pale and\\nprecipitately. The beadle is very careful that two gentlemen not very\\nneat about the cuffs and buttons (for whose accommodation he has\\nprovided a special little table near the coroner in the Harmonic\\nMeeting Room) should see all that is to be seen. For they are the\\npublic chroniclers of such inquiries by the line; and he is not\\nsuperior to the universal human infirmity, but hopes to read in print\\nwhat \"Mooney, the active and intelligent beadle of the district,\"\\nsaid and did and even aspires to see the name of Mooney as familiarly\\nand patronizingly mentioned as the name of the hangman is, according\\nto the latest examples.\\n\\nLittle Swills is waiting for the coroner and jury on their return.\\nMr. Tulkinghorn, also. Mr. Tulkinghorn is received with distinction\\nand seated near the coroner between that high judicial officer, a\\nbagatelle-board, and the coal-box. The inquiry proceeds. The jury\\nlearn how the subject of their inquiry died, and learn no more about\\nhim. \"A very eminent solicitor is in attendance, gentlemen,\" says the\\ncoroner, \"who, I am informed, was accidentally present when discovery\\nof the death was made, but he could only repeat the evidence you have\\nalready heard from the surgeon, the landlord, the lodger, and the\\nlaw-stationer, and it is not necessary to trouble him. Is anybody in\\nattendance who knows anything more?\"\\n\\nMrs. Piper pushed forward by Mrs. Perkins. Mrs. Piper sworn.\\n\\nAnastasia Piper, gentlemen. Married woman. Now, Mrs. Piper, what have\\nyou got to say about this?\\n\\nWhy, Mrs. Piper has a good deal to say, chiefly in parentheses and\\nwithout punctuation, but not much to tell. Mrs. Piper lives in the\\ncourt (which her husband is a cabinet-maker), and it has long been\\nwell beknown among the neighbours (counting from the day next but one\\nbefore the half-baptizing of Alexander James Piper aged eighteen\\nmonths and four days old on accounts of not being expected to live\\nsuch was the sufferings gentlemen of that child in his gums) as the\\nplaintive--so Mrs. Piper insists on calling the deceased--was\\nreported to have sold himself. Thinks it was the plaintive\\'s air in\\nwhich that report originatinin. See the plaintive often and\\nconsidered as his air was feariocious and not to be allowed to go\\nabout some children being timid (and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins\\nmay be brought forard for she is here and will do credit to her\\nhusband and herself and family). Has seen the plaintive wexed and\\nworrited by the children (for children they will ever be and you\\ncannot expect them specially if of playful dispositions to be\\nMethoozellers which you was not yourself). On accounts of this and\\nhis dark looks has often dreamed as she see him take a pick-axe from\\nhis pocket and split Johnny\\'s head (which the child knows not fear\\nand has repeatually called after him close at his eels). Never\\nhowever see the plaintive take a pick-axe or any other wepping far\\nfrom it. Has seen him hurry away when run and called after as if not\\npartial to children and never see him speak to neither child nor\\ngrown person at any time (excepting the boy that sweeps the crossing\\ndown the lane over the way round the corner which if he was here\\nwould tell you that he has been seen a-speaking to him frequent).\\n\\nSays the coroner, is that boy here? Says the beadle, no, sir, he is\\nnot here. Says the coroner, go and fetch him then. In the absence of\\nthe active and intelligent, the coroner converses with Mr.\\nTulkinghorn.\\n\\nOh! Here\\'s the boy, gentlemen!\\n\\nHere he is, very muddy, very hoarse, very ragged. Now, boy! But stop\\na minute. Caution. This boy must be put through a few preliminary\\npaces.\\n\\nName, Jo. Nothing else that he knows on. Don\\'t know that everybody\\nhas two names. Never heerd of sich a think. Don\\'t know that Jo is\\nshort for a longer name. Thinks it long enough for HIM. HE don\\'t find\\nno fault with it. Spell it? No. HE can\\'t spell it. No father, no\\nmother, no friends. Never been to school. What\\'s home? Knows a\\nbroom\\'s a broom, and knows it\\'s wicked to tell a lie. Don\\'t recollect\\nwho told him about the broom or about the lie, but knows both. Can\\'t\\nexactly say what\\'ll be done to him arter he\\'s dead if he tells a lie\\nto the gentlemen here, but believes it\\'ll be something wery bad to\\npunish him, and serve him right--and so he\\'ll tell the truth.\\n\\n\"This won\\'t do, gentlemen!\" says the coroner with a melancholy shake\\nof the head.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you think you can receive his evidence, sir?\" asks an\\nattentive juryman.\\n\\n\"Out of the question,\" says the coroner. \"You have heard the boy.\\n\\'Can\\'t exactly say\\' won\\'t do, you know. We can\\'t take THAT in a court\\nof justice, gentlemen. It\\'s terrible depravity. Put the boy aside.\"\\n\\nBoy put aside, to the great edification of the audience, especially\\nof Little Swills, the comic vocalist.\\n\\nNow. Is there any other witness? No other witness.\\n\\nVery well, gentlemen! Here\\'s a man unknown, proved to have been in\\nthe habit of taking opium in large quantities for a year and a half,\\nfound dead of too much opium. If you think you have any evidence to\\nlead you to the conclusion that he committed suicide, you will come\\nto that conclusion. If you think it is a case of accidental death,\\nyou will find a verdict accordingly.\\n\\nVerdict accordingly. Accidental death. No doubt. Gentlemen, you are\\ndischarged. Good afternoon.\\n\\nWhile the coroner buttons his great-coat, Mr. Tulkinghorn and he give\\nprivate audience to the rejected witness in a corner.\\n\\nThat graceless creature only knows that the dead man (whom he\\nrecognized just now by his yellow face and black hair) was sometimes\\nhooted and pursued about the streets. That one cold winter night when\\nhe, the boy, was shivering in a doorway near his crossing, the man\\nturned to look at him, and came back, and having questioned him and\\nfound that he had not a friend in the world, said, \"Neither have I.\\nNot one!\" and gave him the price of a supper and a night\\'s lodging.\\nThat the man had often spoken to him since and asked him whether he\\nslept sound at night, and how he bore cold and hunger, and whether he\\never wished to die, and similar strange questions. That when the man\\nhad no money, he would say in passing, \"I am as poor as you to-day,\\nJo,\" but that when he had any, he had always (as the boy most\\nheartily believes) been glad to give him some.\\n\\n\"He was wery good to me,\" says the boy, wiping his eyes with his\\nwretched sleeve. \"Wen I see him a-layin\\' so stritched out just now, I\\nwished he could have heerd me tell him so. He wos wery good to me, he\\nwos!\"\\n\\nAs he shuffles downstairs, Mr. Snagsby, lying in wait for him, puts a\\nhalf-crown in his hand. \"If you ever see me coming past your crossing\\nwith my little woman--I mean a lady--\" says Mr. Snagsby with his\\nfinger on his nose, \"don\\'t allude to it!\"\\n\\nFor some little time the jurymen hang about the Sol\\'s Arms\\ncolloquially. In the sequel, half-a-dozen are caught up in a cloud of\\npipe-smoke that pervades the parlour of the Sol\\'s Arms; two stroll to\\nHampstead; and four engage to go half-price to the play at night, and\\ntop up with oysters. Little Swills is treated on several hands. Being\\nasked what he thinks of the proceedings, characterizes them (his\\nstrength lying in a slangular direction) as \"a rummy start.\" The\\nlandlord of the Sol\\'s Arms, finding Little Swills so popular,\\ncommends him highly to the jurymen and public, observing that for a\\nsong in character he don\\'t know his equal and that that man\\'s\\ncharacter-wardrobe would fill a cart.\\n\\nThus, gradually the Sol\\'s Arms melts into the shadowy night and then\\nflares out of it strong in gas. The Harmonic Meeting hour arriving,\\nthe gentleman of professional celebrity takes the chair, is faced\\n(red-faced) by Little Swills; their friends rally round them and\\nsupport first-rate talent. In the zenith of the evening, Little\\nSwills says, \"Gentlemen, if you\\'ll permit me, I\\'ll attempt a short\\ndescription of a scene of real life that came off here to-day.\" Is\\nmuch applauded and encouraged; goes out of the room as Swills; comes\\nin as the coroner (not the least in the world like him); describes\\nthe inquest, with recreative intervals of piano-forte accompaniment,\\nto the refrain: With his (the coroner\\'s) tippy tol li doll, tippy tol\\nlo doll, tippy tol li doll, Dee!\\n\\nThe jingling piano at last is silent, and the Harmonic friends rally\\nround their pillows. Then there is rest around the lonely figure, now\\nlaid in its last earthly habitation; and it is watched by the gaunt\\neyes in the shutters through some quiet hours of night. If this\\nforlorn man could have been prophetically seen lying here by the\\nmother at whose breast he nestled, a little child, with eyes upraised\\nto her loving face, and soft hand scarcely knowing how to close upon\\nthe neck to which it crept, what an impossibility the vision would\\nhave seemed! Oh, if in brighter days the now-extinguished fire within\\nhim ever burned for one woman who held him in her heart, where is\\nshe, while these ashes are above the ground!\\n\\nIt is anything but a night of rest at Mr. Snagsby\\'s, in Cook\\'s Court,\\nwhere Guster murders sleep by going, as Mr. Snagsby himself\\nallows--not to put too fine a point upon it--out of one fit into\\ntwenty. The occasion of this seizure is that Guster has a tender\\nheart and a susceptible something that possibly might have been\\nimagination, but for Tooting and her patron saint. Be it what it may,\\nnow, it was so direfully impressed at tea-time by Mr. Snagsby\\'s\\naccount of the inquiry at which he had assisted that at supper-time\\nshe projected herself into the kitchen, preceded by a flying Dutch\\ncheese, and fell into a fit of unusual duration, which she only came\\nout of to go into another, and another, and so on through a chain of\\nfits, with short intervals between, of which she has pathetically\\navailed herself by consuming them in entreaties to Mrs. Snagsby not\\nto give her warning \"when she quite comes to,\" and also in appeals to\\nthe whole establishment to lay her down on the stones and go to bed.\\nHence, Mr. Snagsby, at last hearing the cock at the little dairy in\\nCursitor Street go into that disinterested ecstasy of his on the\\nsubject of daylight, says, drawing a long breath, though the most\\npatient of men, \"I thought you was dead, I am sure!\"\\n\\nWhat question this enthusiastic fowl supposes he settles when he\\nstrains himself to such an extent, or why he should thus crow (so men\\ncrow on various triumphant public occasions, however) about what\\ncannot be of any moment to him, is his affair. It is enough that\\ndaylight comes, morning comes, noon comes.\\n\\nThen the active and intelligent, who has got into the morning papers\\nas such, comes with his pauper company to Mr. Krook\\'s and bears off\\nthe body of our dear brother here departed to a hemmed-in churchyard,\\npestiferous and obscene, whence malignant diseases are communicated\\nto the bodies of our dear brothers and sisters who have not departed,\\nwhile our dear brothers and sisters who hang about official\\nback-stairs--would to heaven they HAD departed!--are very complacent\\nand agreeable. Into a beastly scrap of ground which a Turk would\\nreject as a savage abomination and a Caffre would shudder at, they\\nbring our dear brother here departed to receive Christian burial.\\n\\nWith houses looking on, on every side, save where a reeking little\\ntunnel of a court gives access to the iron gate--with every villainy\\nof life in action close on death, and every poisonous element of\\ndeath in action close on life--here they lower our dear brother down\\na foot or two, here sow him in corruption, to be raised in\\ncorruption: an avenging ghost at many a sick-bedside, a shameful\\ntestimony to future ages how civilization and barbarism walked this\\nboastful island together.\\n\\nCome night, come darkness, for you cannot come too soon or stay too\\nlong by such a place as this! Come, straggling lights into the\\nwindows of the ugly houses; and you who do iniquity therein, do it at\\nleast with this dread scene shut out! Come, flame of gas, burning so\\nsullenly above the iron gate, on which the poisoned air deposits its\\nwitch-ointment slimy to the touch! It is well that you should call to\\nevery passerby, \"Look here!\"\\n\\nWith the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel-court to\\nthe outside of the iron gate. It holds the gate with its hands and\\nlooks in between the bars, stands looking in for a little while.\\n\\nIt then, with an old broom it carries, softly sweeps the step and\\nmakes the archway clean. It does so very busily and trimly, looks in\\nagain a little while, and so departs.\\n\\nJo, is it thou? Well, well! Though a rejected witness, who \"can\\'t\\nexactly say\" what will be done to him in greater hands than men\\'s,\\nthou art not quite in outer darkness. There is something like a\\ndistant ray of light in thy muttered reason for this: \"He wos wery\\ngood to me, he wos!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt has left off raining down in Lincolnshire at last, and Chesney\\nWold has taken heart. Mrs. Rouncewell is full of hospitable cares,\\nfor Sir Leicester and my Lady are coming home from Paris. The\\nfashionable intelligence has found it out and communicates the glad\\ntidings to benighted England. It has also found out that they will\\nentertain a brilliant and distinguished circle of the ELITE of the\\nBEAU MONDE (the fashionable intelligence is weak in English, but a\\ngiant refreshed in French) at the ancient and hospitable family seat\\nin Lincolnshire.\\n\\nFor the greater honour of the brilliant and distinguished circle, and\\nof Chesney Wold into the bargain, the broken arch of the bridge in\\nthe park is mended; and the water, now retired within its proper\\nlimits and again spanned gracefully, makes a figure in the prospect\\nfrom the house. The clear, cold sunshine glances into the brittle\\nwoods and approvingly beholds the sharp wind scattering the leaves\\nand drying the moss. It glides over the park after the moving shadows\\nof the clouds, and chases them, and never catches them, all day. It\\nlooks in at the windows and touches the ancestral portraits with bars\\nand patches of brightness never contemplated by the painters. Athwart\\nthe picture of my Lady, over the great chimney-piece, it throws a\\nbroad bend-sinister of light that strikes down crookedly into the\\nhearth and seems to rend it.\\n\\nThrough the same cold sunshine and the same sharp wind, my Lady and\\nSir Leicester, in their travelling chariot (my Lady\\'s woman and Sir\\nLeicester\\'s man affectionate in the rumble), start for home. With a\\nconsiderable amount of jingling and whip-cracking, and many plunging\\ndemonstrations on the part of two bare-backed horses and two centaurs\\nwith glazed hats, jack-boots, and flowing manes and tails, they\\nrattle out of the yard of the Hotel Bristol in the Place Vendome and\\ncanter between the sun-and-shadow-chequered colonnade of the Rue de\\nRivoli and the garden of the ill-fated palace of a headless king and\\nqueen, off by the Place of Concord, and the Elysian Fields, and the\\nGate of the Star, out of Paris.\\n\\nSooth to say, they cannot go away too fast, for even here my Lady\\nDedlock has been bored to death. Concert, assembly, opera, theatre,\\ndrive, nothing is new to my Lady under the worn-out heavens. Only\\nlast Sunday, when poor wretches were gay--within the walls playing\\nwith children among the clipped trees and the statues in the Palace\\nGarden; walking, a score abreast, in the Elysian Fields, made more\\nElysian by performing dogs and wooden horses; between whiles\\nfiltering (a few) through the gloomy Cathedral of Our Lady to say a\\nword or two at the base of a pillar within flare of a rusty little\\ngridiron-full of gusty little tapers; without the walls encompassing\\nParis with dancing, love-making, wine-drinking, tobacco-smoking,\\ntomb-visiting, billiard card and domino playing, quack-doctoring, and\\nmuch murderous refuse, animate and inanimate--only last Sunday, my\\nLady, in the desolation of Boredom and the clutch of Giant Despair,\\nalmost hated her own maid for being in spirits.\\n\\nShe cannot, therefore, go too fast from Paris. Weariness of soul lies\\nbefore her, as it lies behind--her Ariel has put a girdle of it round\\nthe whole earth, and it cannot be unclasped--but the imperfect remedy\\nis always to fly from the last place where it has been experienced.\\nFling Paris back into the distance, then, exchanging it for endless\\navenues and cross-avenues of wintry trees! And, when next beheld, let\\nit be some leagues away, with the Gate of the Star a white speck\\nglittering in the sun, and the city a mere mound in a plain--two dark\\nsquare towers rising out of it, and light and shadow descending on it\\naslant, like the angels in Jacob\\'s dream!\\n\\nSir Leicester is generally in a complacent state, and rarely bored.\\nWhen he has nothing else to do, he can always contemplate his own\\ngreatness. It is a considerable advantage to a man to have so\\ninexhaustible a subject. After reading his letters, he leans back in\\nhis corner of the carriage and generally reviews his importance to\\nsociety.\\n\\n\"You have an unusual amount of correspondence this morning?\" says my\\nLady after a long time. She is fatigued with reading. Has almost read\\na page in twenty miles.\\n\\n\"Nothing in it, though. Nothing whatever.\"\\n\\n\"I saw one of Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s long effusions, I think?\"\\n\\n\"You see everything,\" says Sir Leicester with admiration.\\n\\n\"Ha!\" sighs my Lady. \"He is the most tiresome of men!\"\\n\\n\"He sends--I really beg your pardon--he sends,\" says Sir Leicester,\\nselecting the letter and unfolding it, \"a message to you. Our\\nstopping to change horses as I came to his postscript drove it out of\\nmy memory. I beg you\\'ll excuse me. He says--\" Sir Leicester is so\\nlong in taking out his eye-glass and adjusting it that my Lady looks\\na little irritated. \"He says \\'In the matter of the right of way--\\' I\\nbeg your pardon, that\\'s not the place. He says--yes! Here I have it!\\nHe says, \\'I beg my respectful compliments to my Lady, who, I hope,\\nhas benefited by the change. Will you do me the favour to mention (as\\nit may interest her) that I have something to tell her on her return\\nin reference to the person who copied the affidavit in the Chancery\\nsuit, which so powerfully stimulated her curiosity. I have seen\\nhim.\\'\"\\n\\nMy Lady, leaning forward, looks out of her window.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the message,\" observes Sir Leicester.\\n\\n\"I should like to walk a little,\" says my Lady, still looking out of\\nher window.\\n\\n\"Walk?\" repeats Sir Leicester in a tone of surprise.\\n\\n\"I should like to walk a little,\" says my Lady with unmistakable\\ndistinctness. \"Please to stop the carriage.\"\\n\\nThe carriage is stopped, the affectionate man alights from the\\nrumble, opens the door, and lets down the steps, obedient to an\\nimpatient motion of my Lady\\'s hand. My Lady alights so quickly and\\nwalks away so quickly that Sir Leicester, for all his scrupulous\\npoliteness, is unable to assist her, and is left behind. A space of a\\nminute or two has elapsed before he comes up with her. She smiles,\\nlooks very handsome, takes his arm, lounges with him for a quarter of\\na mile, is very much bored, and resumes her seat in the carriage.\\n\\nThe rattle and clatter continue through the greater part of three\\ndays, with more or less of bell-jingling and whip-cracking, and more\\nor less plunging of centaurs and bare-backed horses. Their courtly\\npoliteness to each other at the hotels where they tarry is the theme\\nof general admiration. Though my Lord IS a little aged for my Lady,\\nsays Madame, the hostess of the Golden Ape, and though he might be\\nher amiable father, one can see at a glance that they love each\\nother. One observes my Lord with his white hair, standing, hat in\\nhand, to help my Lady to and from the carriage. One observes my Lady,\\nhow recognisant of my Lord\\'s politeness, with an inclination of her\\ngracious head and the concession of her so-genteel fingers! It is\\nravishing!\\n\\nThe sea has no appreciation of great men, but knocks them about like\\nthe small fry. It is habitually hard upon Sir Leicester, whose\\ncountenance it greenly mottles in the manner of sage-cheese and in\\nwhose aristocratic system it effects a dismal revolution. It is the\\nRadical of Nature to him. Nevertheless, his dignity gets over it\\nafter stopping to refit, and he goes on with my Lady for Chesney\\nWold, lying only one night in London on the way to Lincolnshire.\\n\\nThrough the same cold sunlight, colder as the day declines, and\\nthrough the same sharp wind, sharper as the separate shadows of bare\\ntrees gloom together in the woods, and as the Ghost\\'s Walk, touched\\nat the western corner by a pile of fire in the sky, resigns itself to\\ncoming night, they drive into the park. The rooks, swinging in their\\nlofty houses in the elm-tree avenue, seem to discuss the question of\\nthe occupancy of the carriage as it passes underneath, some agreeing\\nthat Sir Leicester and my Lady are come down, some arguing with\\nmalcontents who won\\'t admit it, now all consenting to consider the\\nquestion disposed of, now all breaking out again in violent debate,\\nincited by one obstinate and drowsy bird who will persist in putting\\nin a last contradictory croak. Leaving them to swing and caw, the\\ntravelling chariot rolls on to the house, where fires gleam warmly\\nthrough some of the windows, though not through so many as to give an\\ninhabited expression to the darkening mass of front. But the\\nbrilliant and distinguished circle will soon do that.\\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell is in attendance and receives Sir Leicester\\'s\\ncustomary shake of the hand with a profound curtsy.\\n\\n\"How do you do, Mrs. Rouncewell? I am glad to see you.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I have the honour of welcoming you in good health, Sir\\nLeicester?\"\\n\\n\"In excellent health, Mrs. Rouncewell.\"\\n\\n\"My Lady is looking charmingly well,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell with\\nanother curtsy.\\n\\nMy Lady signifies, without profuse expenditure of words, that she is\\nas wearily well as she can hope to be.\\n\\nBut Rosa is in the distance, behind the housekeeper; and my Lady, who\\nhas not subdued the quickness of her observation, whatever else she\\nmay have conquered, asks, \"Who is that girl?\"\\n\\n\"A young scholar of mine, my Lady. Rosa.\"\\n\\n\"Come here, Rosa!\" Lady Dedlock beckons her, with even an appearance\\nof interest. \"Why, do you know how pretty you are, child?\" she says,\\ntouching her shoulder with her two forefingers.\\n\\nRosa, very much abashed, says, \"No, if you please, my Lady!\" and\\nglances up, and glances down, and don\\'t know where to look, but looks\\nall the prettier.\\n\\n\"How old are you?\"\\n\\n\"Nineteen, my Lady.\"\\n\\n\"Nineteen,\" repeats my Lady thoughtfully. \"Take care they don\\'t spoil\\nyou by flattery.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my Lady.\"\\n\\nMy Lady taps her dimpled cheek with the same delicate gloved fingers\\nand goes on to the foot of the oak staircase, where Sir Leicester\\npauses for her as her knightly escort. A staring old Dedlock in a\\npanel, as large as life and as dull, looks as if he didn\\'t know what\\nto make of it, which was probably his general state of mind in the\\ndays of Queen Elizabeth.\\n\\nThat evening, in the housekeeper\\'s room, Rosa can do nothing but\\nmurmur Lady Dedlock\\'s praises. She is so affable, so graceful, so\\nbeautiful, so elegant; has such a sweet voice and such a thrilling\\ntouch that Rosa can feel it yet! Mrs. Rouncewell confirms all this,\\nnot without personal pride, reserving only the one point of\\naffability. Mrs. Rouncewell is not quite sure as to that. Heaven\\nforbid that she should say a syllable in dispraise of any member of\\nthat excellent family, above all, of my Lady, whom the whole world\\nadmires; but if my Lady would only be \"a little more free,\" not quite\\nso cold and distant, Mrs. Rouncewell thinks she would be more\\naffable.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis almost a pity,\" Mrs. Rouncewell adds--only \"almost\" because it\\nborders on impiety to suppose that anything could be better than it\\nis, in such an express dispensation as the Dedlock affairs--\"that my\\nLady has no family. If she had had a daughter now, a grown young\\nlady, to interest her, I think she would have had the only kind of\\nexcellence she wants.\"\\n\\n\"Might not that have made her still more proud, grandmother?\" says\\nWatt, who has been home and come back again, he is such a good\\ngrandson.\\n\\n\"More and most, my dear,\" returns the housekeeper with dignity, \"are\\nwords it\\'s not my place to use--nor so much as to hear--applied to\\nany drawback on my Lady.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, grandmother. But she is proud, is she not?\"\\n\\n\"If she is, she has reason to be. The Dedlock family have always\\nreason to be.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" says Watt, \"it\\'s to be hoped they line out of their\\nprayer-books a certain passage for the common people about pride and\\nvainglory. Forgive me, grandmother! Only a joke!\"\\n\\n\"Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock, my dear, are not fit subjects for\\njoking.\"\\n\\n\"Sir Leicester is no joke by any means,\" says Watt, \"and I humbly ask\\nhis pardon. I suppose, grandmother, that even with the family and\\ntheir guests down here, there is no objection to my prolonging my\\nstay at the Dedlock Arms for a day or two, as any other traveller\\nmight?\"\\n\\n\"Surely, none in the world, child.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad of that,\" says Watt, \"because I have an inexpressible\\ndesire to extend my knowledge of this beautiful neighbourhood.\"\\n\\nHe happens to glance at Rosa, who looks down and is very shy indeed.\\nBut according to the old superstition, it should be Rosa\\'s ears that\\nburn, and not her fresh bright cheeks, for my Lady\\'s maid is holding\\nforth about her at this moment with surpassing energy.\\n\\nMy Lady\\'s maid is a Frenchwoman of two and thirty, from somewhere in\\nthe southern country about Avignon and Marseilles, a large-eyed brown\\nwoman with black hair who would be handsome but for a certain feline\\nmouth and general uncomfortable tightness of face, rendering the jaws\\ntoo eager and the skull too prominent. There is something indefinably\\nkeen and wan about her anatomy, and she has a watchful way of looking\\nout of the corners of her eyes without turning her head which could\\nbe pleasantly dispensed with, especially when she is in an ill humour\\nand near knives. Through all the good taste of her dress and little\\nadornments, these objections so express themselves that she seems to\\ngo about like a very neat she-wolf imperfectly tamed. Besides being\\naccomplished in all the knowledge appertaining to her post, she is\\nalmost an Englishwoman in her acquaintance with the language;\\nconsequently, she is in no want of words to shower upon Rosa for\\nhaving attracted my Lady\\'s attention, and she pours them out with\\nsuch grim ridicule as she sits at dinner that her companion, the\\naffectionate man, is rather relieved when she arrives at the spoon\\nstage of that performance.\\n\\nHa, ha, ha! She, Hortense, been in my Lady\\'s service since five years\\nand always kept at the distance, and this doll, this puppet,\\ncaressed--absolutely caressed--by my Lady on the moment of her\\narriving at the house! Ha, ha, ha! \"And do you know how pretty you\\nare, child?\" \"No, my Lady.\" You are right there! \"And how old are\\nyou, child! And take care they do not spoil you by flattery, child!\"\\nOh, how droll! It is the BEST thing altogether.\\n\\nIn short, it is such an admirable thing that Mademoiselle Hortense\\ncan\\'t forget it; but at meals for days afterwards, even among her\\ncountrywomen and others attached in like capacity to the troop of\\nvisitors, relapses into silent enjoyment of the joke--an enjoyment\\nexpressed, in her own convivial manner, by an additional tightness of\\nface, thin elongation of compressed lips, and sidewise look, which\\nintense appreciation of humour is frequently reflected in my Lady\\'s\\nmirrors when my Lady is not among them.\\n\\nAll the mirrors in the house are brought into action now, many of\\nthem after a long blank. They reflect handsome faces, simpering\\nfaces, youthful faces, faces of threescore and ten that will not\\nsubmit to be old; the entire collection of faces that have come to\\npass a January week or two at Chesney Wold, and which the fashionable\\nintelligence, a mighty hunter before the Lord, hunts with a keen\\nscent, from their breaking cover at the Court of St. James\\'s to their\\nbeing run down to death. The place in Lincolnshire is all alive. By\\nday guns and voices are heard ringing in the woods, horsemen and\\ncarriages enliven the park roads, servants and hangers-on pervade the\\nvillage and the Dedlock Arms. Seen by night from distant openings in\\nthe trees, the row of windows in the long drawing-room, where my\\nLady\\'s picture hangs over the great chimney-piece, is like a row of\\njewels set in a black frame. On Sunday the chill little church is\\nalmost warmed by so much gallant company, and the general flavour of\\nthe Dedlock dust is quenched in delicate perfumes.\\n\\nThe brilliant and distinguished circle comprehends within it no\\ncontracted amount of education, sense, courage, honour, beauty, and\\nvirtue. Yet there is something a little wrong about it in despite of\\nits immense advantages. What can it be?\\n\\nDandyism? There is no King George the Fourth now (more the pity) to\\nset the dandy fashion; there are no clear-starched jack-towel\\nneckcloths, no short-waisted coats, no false calves, no stays. There\\nare no caricatures, now, of effeminate exquisites so arrayed,\\nswooning in opera boxes with excess of delight and being revived by\\nother dainty creatures poking long-necked scent-bottles at their\\nnoses. There is no beau whom it takes four men at once to shake into\\nhis buckskins, or who goes to see all the executions, or who is\\ntroubled with the self-reproach of having once consumed a pea. But is\\nthere dandyism in the brilliant and distinguished circle\\nnotwithstanding, dandyism of a more mischievous sort, that has got\\nbelow the surface and is doing less harmless things than\\njack-towelling itself and stopping its own digestion, to which no\\nrational person need particularly object?\\n\\nWhy, yes. It cannot be disguised. There ARE at Chesney Wold this\\nJanuary week some ladies and gentlemen of the newest fashion, who\\nhave set up a dandyism--in religion, for instance. Who in mere\\nlackadaisical want of an emotion have agreed upon a little dandy talk\\nabout the vulgar wanting faith in things in general, meaning in the\\nthings that have been tried and found wanting, as though a low fellow\\nshould unaccountably lose faith in a bad shilling after finding it\\nout! Who would make the vulgar very picturesque and faithful by\\nputting back the hands upon the clock of time and cancelling a few\\nhundred years of history.\\n\\nThere are also ladies and gentlemen of another fashion, not so new,\\nbut very elegant, who have agreed to put a smooth glaze on the world\\nand to keep down all its realities. For whom everything must be\\nlanguid and pretty. Who have found out the perpetual stoppage. Who\\nare to rejoice at nothing and be sorry for nothing. Who are not to be\\ndisturbed by ideas. On whom even the fine arts, attending in powder\\nand walking backward like the Lord Chamberlain, must array themselves\\nin the milliners\\' and tailors\\' patterns of past generations and be\\nparticularly careful not to be in earnest or to receive any impress\\nfrom the moving age.\\n\\nThen there is my Lord Boodle, of considerable reputation with his\\nparty, who has known what office is and who tells Sir Leicester\\nDedlock with much gravity, after dinner, that he really does not see\\nto what the present age is tending. A debate is not what a debate\\nused to be; the House is not what the House used to be; even a\\nCabinet is not what it formerly was. He perceives with astonishment\\nthat supposing the present government to be overthrown, the limited\\nchoice of the Crown, in the formation of a new ministry, would lie\\nbetween Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle--supposing it to be\\nimpossible for the Duke of Foodle to act with Goodle, which may be\\nassumed to be the case in consequence of the breach arising out of\\nthat affair with Hoodle. Then, giving the Home Department and the\\nleadership of the House of Commons to Joodle, the Exchequer to\\nKoodle, the Colonies to Loodle, and the Foreign Office to Moodle,\\nwhat are you to do with Noodle? You can\\'t offer him the Presidency of\\nthe Council; that is reserved for Poodle. You can\\'t put him in the\\nWoods and Forests; that is hardly good enough for Quoodle. What\\nfollows? That the country is shipwrecked, lost, and gone to pieces\\n(as is made manifest to the patriotism of Sir Leicester Dedlock)\\nbecause you can\\'t provide for Noodle!\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Right Honourable William Buffy, M.P., contends\\nacross the table with some one else that the shipwreck of the\\ncountry--about which there is no doubt; it is only the manner of it\\nthat is in question--is attributable to Cuffy. If you had done with\\nCuffy what you ought to have done when he first came into Parliament,\\nand had prevented him from going over to Duffy, you would have got\\nhim into alliance with Fuffy, you would have had with you the weight\\nattaching as a smart debater to Guffy, you would have brought to bear\\nupon the elections the wealth of Huffy, you would have got in for\\nthree counties Juffy, Kuffy, and Luffy, and you would have\\nstrengthened your administration by the official knowledge and the\\nbusiness habits of Muffy. All this, instead of being as you now are,\\ndependent on the mere caprice of Puffy!\\n\\nAs to this point, and as to some minor topics, there are differences\\nof opinion; but it is perfectly clear to the brilliant and\\ndistinguished circle, all round, that nobody is in question but\\nBoodle and his retinue, and Buffy and HIS retinue. These are the\\ngreat actors for whom the stage is reserved. A People there are, no\\ndoubt--a certain large number of supernumeraries, who are to be\\noccasionally addressed, and relied upon for shouts and choruses, as\\non the theatrical stage; but Boodle and Buffy, their followers and\\nfamilies, their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, are\\nthe born first-actors, managers, and leaders, and no others can\\nappear upon the scene for ever and ever.\\n\\nIn this, too, there is perhaps more dandyism at Chesney Wold than the\\nbrilliant and distinguished circle will find good for itself in the\\nlong run. For it is, even with the stillest and politest circles, as\\nwith the circle the necromancer draws around him--very strange\\nappearances may be seen in active motion outside. With this\\ndifference, that being realities and not phantoms, there is the\\ngreater danger of their breaking in.\\n\\nChesney Wold is quite full anyhow, so full that a burning sense of\\ninjury arises in the breasts of ill-lodged ladies\\'-maids, and is not\\nto be extinguished. Only one room is empty. It is a turret chamber of\\nthe third order of merit, plainly but comfortably furnished and\\nhaving an old-fashioned business air. It is Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s room,\\nand is never bestowed on anybody else, for he may come at any time.\\nHe is not come yet. It is his quiet habit to walk across the park\\nfrom the village in fine weather, to drop into this room as if he had\\nnever been out of it since he was last seen there, to request a\\nservant to inform Sir Leicester that he is arrived in case he should\\nbe wanted, and to appear ten minutes before dinner in the shadow of\\nthe library-door. He sleeps in his turret with a complaining\\nflag-staff over his head, and has some leads outside on which, any\\nfine morning when he is down here, his black figure may be seen\\nwalking before breakfast like a larger species of rook.\\n\\nEvery day before dinner, my Lady looks for him in the dusk of the\\nlibrary, but he is not there. Every day at dinner, my Lady glances\\ndown the table for the vacant place that would be waiting to receive\\nhim if he had just arrived, but there is no vacant place. Every night\\nmy Lady casually asks her maid, \"Is Mr. Tulkinghorn come?\"\\n\\nEvery night the answer is, \"No, my Lady, not yet.\"\\n\\nOne night, while having her hair undressed, my Lady loses herself in\\ndeep thought after this reply until she sees her own brooding face in\\nthe opposite glass, and a pair of black eyes curiously observing her.\\n\\n\"Be so good as to attend,\" says my Lady then, addressing the\\nreflection of Hortense, \"to your business. You can contemplate your\\nbeauty at another time.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon! It was your Ladyship\\'s beauty.\"\\n\\n\"That,\" says my Lady, \"you needn\\'t contemplate at all.\"\\n\\nAt length, one afternoon a little before sunset, when the bright\\ngroups of figures which have for the last hour or two enlivened the\\nGhost\\'s Walk are all dispersed and only Sir Leicester and my Lady\\nremain upon the terrace, Mr. Tulkinghorn appears. He comes towards\\nthem at his usual methodical pace, which is never quickened, never\\nslackened. He wears his usual expressionless mask--if it be a\\nmask--and carries family secrets in every limb of his body and every\\ncrease of his dress. Whether his whole soul is devoted to the great\\nor whether he yields them nothing beyond the services he sells is his\\npersonal secret. He keeps it, as he keeps the secrets of his clients;\\nhe is his own client in that matter, and will never betray himself.\\n\\n\"How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?\" says Sir Leicester, giving him his\\nhand.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn is quite well. Sir Leicester is quite well. My Lady\\nis quite well. All highly satisfactory. The lawyer, with his hands\\nbehind him, walks at Sir Leicester\\'s side along the terrace. My Lady\\nwalks upon the other side.\\n\\n\"We expected you before,\" says Sir Leicester. A gracious observation.\\nAs much as to say, \"Mr. Tulkinghorn, we remember your existence when\\nyou are not here to remind us of it by your presence. We bestow a\\nfragment of our minds upon you, sir, you see!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn, comprehending it, inclines his head and says he is\\nmuch obliged.\\n\\n\"I should have come down sooner,\" he explains, \"but that I have been\\nmuch engaged with those matters in the several suits between yourself\\nand Boythorn.\"\\n\\n\"A man of a very ill-regulated mind,\" observes Sir Leicester with\\nseverity. \"An extremely dangerous person in any community. A man of a\\nvery low character of mind.\"\\n\\n\"He is obstinate,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"It is natural to such a man to be so,\" says Sir Leicester, looking\\nmost profoundly obstinate himself. \"I am not at all surprised to hear\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"The only question is,\" pursues the lawyer, \"whether you will give up\\nanything.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replies Sir Leicester. \"Nothing. I give up?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mean anything of importance. That, of course, I know you\\nwould not abandon. I mean any minor point.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" returns Sir Leicester, \"there can be no minor\\npoint between myself and Mr. Boythorn. If I go farther, and observe\\nthat I cannot readily conceive how ANY right of mine can be a minor\\npoint, I speak not so much in reference to myself as an individual as\\nin reference to the family position I have it in charge to maintain.\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn inclines his head again. \"I have now my\\ninstructions,\" he says. \"Mr. Boythorn will give us a good deal of\\ntrouble--\"\\n\\n\"It is the character of such a mind, Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" Sir Leicester\\ninterrupts him, \"TO give trouble. An exceedingly ill-conditioned,\\nlevelling person. A person who, fifty years ago, would probably have\\nbeen tried at the Old Bailey for some demagogue proceeding, and\\nseverely punished--if not,\" adds Sir Leicester after a moment\\'s\\npause, \"if not hanged, drawn, and quartered.\"\\n\\nSir Leicester appears to discharge his stately breast of a burden in\\npassing this capital sentence, as if it were the next satisfactory\\nthing to having the sentence executed.\\n\\n\"But night is coming on,\" says he, \"and my Lady will take cold. My\\ndear, let us go in.\"\\n\\nAs they turn towards the hall-door, Lady Dedlock addresses Mr.\\nTulkinghorn for the first time.\\n\\n\"You sent me a message respecting the person whose writing I happened\\nto inquire about. It was like you to remember the circumstance; I had\\nquite forgotten it. Your message reminded me of it again. I can\\'t\\nimagine what association I had with a hand like that, but I surely\\nhad some.\"\\n\\n\"You had some?\" Mr. Tulkinghorn repeats.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" returns my Lady carelessly. \"I think I must have had some.\\nAnd did you really take the trouble to find out the writer of that\\nactual thing--what is it!--affidavit?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"How very odd!\"\\n\\nThey pass into a sombre breakfast-room on the ground floor, lighted\\nin the day by two deep windows. It is now twilight. The fire glows\\nbrightly on the panelled wall and palely on the window-glass, where,\\nthrough the cold reflection of the blaze, the colder landscape\\nshudders in the wind and a grey mist creeps along, the only traveller\\nbesides the waste of clouds.\\n\\nMy Lady lounges in a great chair in the chimney-corner, and Sir\\nLeicester takes another great chair opposite. The lawyer stands\\nbefore the fire with his hand out at arm\\'s length, shading his face.\\nHe looks across his arm at my Lady.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he says, \"I inquired about the man, and found him. And, what\\nis very strange, I found him--\"\\n\\n\"Not to be any out-of-the-way person, I am afraid!\" Lady Dedlock\\nlanguidly anticipates.\\n\\n\"I found him dead.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear me!\" remonstrated Sir Leicester. Not so much shocked by the\\nfact as by the fact of the fact being mentioned.\\n\\n\"I was directed to his lodging--a miserable, poverty-stricken\\nplace--and I found him dead.\"\\n\\n\"You will excuse me, Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" observes Sir Leicester. \"I\\nthink the less said--\"\\n\\n\"Pray, Sir Leicester, let me hear the story out\" (it is my Lady\\nspeaking). \"It is quite a story for twilight. How very shocking!\\nDead?\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn re-asserts it by another inclination of his head.\\n\"Whether by his own hand--\"\\n\\n\"Upon my honour!\" cries Sir Leicester. \"Really!\"\\n\\n\"Do let me hear the story!\" says my Lady.\\n\\n\"Whatever you desire, my dear. But, I must say--\"\\n\\n\"No, you mustn\\'t say! Go on, Mr. Tulkinghorn.\"\\n\\nSir Leicester\\'s gallantry concedes the point, though he still feels\\nthat to bring this sort of squalor among the upper classes is\\nreally--really--\\n\\n\"I was about to say,\" resumes the lawyer with undisturbed calmness,\\n\"that whether he had died by his own hand or not, it was beyond my\\npower to tell you. I should amend that phrase, however, by saying\\nthat he had unquestionably died of his own act, though whether by his\\nown deliberate intention or by mischance can never certainly be\\nknown. The coroner\\'s jury found that he took the poison\\naccidentally.\"\\n\\n\"And what kind of man,\" my Lady asks, \"was this deplorable creature?\"\\n\\n\"Very difficult to say,\" returns the lawyer, shaking his head. \"He\\nhad lived so wretchedly and was so neglected, with his gipsy colour\\nand his wild black hair and beard, that I should have considered him\\nthe commonest of the common. The surgeon had a notion that he had\\nonce been something better, both in appearance and condition.\"\\n\\n\"What did they call the wretched being?\"\\n\\n\"They called him what he had called himself, but no one knew his\\nname.\"\\n\\n\"Not even any one who had attended on him?\"\\n\\n\"No one had attended on him. He was found dead. In fact, I found\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"Without any clue to anything more?\"\\n\\n\"Without any; there was,\" says the lawyer meditatively, \"an old\\nportmanteau, but--No, there were no papers.\"\\n\\nDuring the utterance of every word of this short dialogue, Lady\\nDedlock and Mr. Tulkinghorn, without any other alteration in their\\ncustomary deportment, have looked very steadily at one another--as\\nwas natural, perhaps, in the discussion of so unusual a subject. Sir\\nLeicester has looked at the fire, with the general expression of the\\nDedlock on the staircase. The story being told, he renews his stately\\nprotest, saying that as it is quite clear that no association in my\\nLady\\'s mind can possibly be traceable to this poor wretch (unless he\\nwas a begging-letter writer), he trusts to hear no more about a\\nsubject so far removed from my Lady\\'s station.\\n\\n\"Certainly, a collection of horrors,\" says my Lady, gathering up her\\nmantles and furs, \"but they interest one for the moment! Have the\\nkindness, Mr. Tulkinghorn, to open the door for me.\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn does so with deference and holds it open while she\\npasses out. She passes close to him, with her usual fatigued manner\\nand insolent grace. They meet again at dinner--again, next\\nday--again, for many days in succession. Lady Dedlock is always the\\nsame exhausted deity, surrounded by worshippers, and terribly liable\\nto be bored to death, even while presiding at her own shrine. Mr.\\nTulkinghorn is always the same speechless repository of noble\\nconfidences, so oddly out of place and yet so perfectly at home. They\\nappear to take as little note of one another as any two people\\nenclosed within the same walls could. But whether each evermore\\nwatches and suspects the other, evermore mistrustful of some great\\nreservation; whether each is evermore prepared at all points for the\\nother, and never to be taken unawares; what each would give to know\\nhow much the other knows--all this is hidden, for the time, in their\\nown hearts.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe held many consultations about what Richard was to be, first\\nwithout Mr. Jarndyce, as he had requested, and afterwards with him,\\nbut it was a long time before we seemed to make progress. Richard\\nsaid he was ready for anything. When Mr. Jarndyce doubted whether he\\nmight not already be too old to enter the Navy, Richard said he had\\nthought of that, and perhaps he was. When Mr. Jarndyce asked him what\\nhe thought of the Army, Richard said he had thought of that, too, and\\nit wasn\\'t a bad idea. When Mr. Jarndyce advised him to try and decide\\nwithin himself whether his old preference for the sea was an ordinary\\nboyish inclination or a strong impulse, Richard answered, Well he\\nreally HAD tried very often, and he couldn\\'t make out.\\n\\n\"How much of this indecision of character,\" Mr. Jarndyce said to me,\\n\"is chargeable on that incomprehensible heap of uncertainty and\\nprocrastination on which he has been thrown from his birth, I don\\'t\\npretend to say; but that Chancery, among its other sins, is\\nresponsible for some of it, I can plainly see. It has engendered or\\nconfirmed in him a habit of putting off--and trusting to this, that,\\nand the other chance, without knowing what chance--and dismissing\\neverything as unsettled, uncertain, and confused. The character of\\nmuch older and steadier people may be even changed by the\\ncircumstances surrounding them. It would be too much to expect that a\\nboy\\'s, in its formation, should be the subject of such influences and\\nescape them.\"\\n\\nI felt this to be true; though if I may venture to mention what I\\nthought besides, I thought it much to be regretted that Richard\\'s\\neducation had not counteracted those influences or directed his\\ncharacter. He had been eight years at a public school and had learnt,\\nI understood, to make Latin verses of several sorts in the most\\nadmirable manner. But I never heard that it had been anybody\\'s\\nbusiness to find out what his natural bent was, or where his failings\\nlay, or to adapt any kind of knowledge to HIM. HE had been adapted to\\nthe verses and had learnt the art of making them to such perfection\\nthat if he had remained at school until he was of age, I suppose he\\ncould only have gone on making them over and over again unless he had\\nenlarged his education by forgetting how to do it. Still, although I\\nhad no doubt that they were very beautiful, and very improving, and\\nvery sufficient for a great many purposes of life, and always\\nremembered all through life, I did doubt whether Richard would not\\nhave profited by some one studying him a little, instead of his\\nstudying them quite so much.\\n\\nTo be sure, I knew nothing of the subject and do not even now know\\nwhether the young gentlemen of classic Rome or Greece made verses to\\nthe same extent--or whether the young gentlemen of any country ever\\ndid.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t the least idea,\" said Richard, musing, \"what I had better\\nbe. Except that I am quite sure I don\\'t want to go into the Church,\\nit\\'s a toss-up.\"\\n\\n\"You have no inclination in Mr. Kenge\\'s way?\" suggested Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know that, sir!\" replied Richard. \"I am fond of boating.\\nArticled clerks go a good deal on the water. It\\'s a capital\\nprofession!\"\\n\\n\"Surgeon--\" suggested Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the thing, sir!\" cried Richard.\\n\\nI doubt if he had ever once thought of it before.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the thing, sir,\" repeated Richard with the greatest\\nenthusiasm. \"We have got it at last. M.R.C.S.!\"\\n\\nHe was not to be laughed out of it, though he laughed at it heartily.\\nHe said he had chosen his profession, and the more he thought of it,\\nthe more he felt that his destiny was clear; the art of healing was\\nthe art of all others for him. Mistrusting that he only came to this\\nconclusion because, having never had much chance of finding out for\\nhimself what he was fitted for and having never been guided to the\\ndiscovery, he was taken by the newest idea and was glad to get rid of\\nthe trouble of consideration, I wondered whether the Latin verses\\noften ended in this or whether Richard\\'s was a solitary case.\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce took great pains to talk with him seriously and to put\\nit to his good sense not to deceive himself in so important a matter.\\nRichard was a little grave after these interviews, but invariably\\ntold Ada and me that it was all right, and then began to talk about\\nsomething else.\\n\\n\"By heaven!\" cried Mr. Boythorn, who interested himself strongly in\\nthe subject--though I need not say that, for he could do nothing\\nweakly; \"I rejoice to find a young gentleman of spirit and gallantry\\ndevoting himself to that noble profession! The more spirit there is\\nin it, the better for mankind and the worse for those mercenary\\ntask-masters and low tricksters who delight in putting that\\nillustrious art at a disadvantage in the world. By all that is base\\nand despicable,\" cried Mr. Boythorn, \"the treatment of surgeons\\naboard ship is such that I would submit the legs--both legs--of every\\nmember of the Admiralty Board to a compound fracture and render it a\\ntransportable offence in any qualified practitioner to set them if\\nthe system were not wholly changed in eight and forty hours!\"\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t you give them a week?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"No!\" cried Mr. Boythorn firmly. \"Not on any consideration! Eight and\\nforty hours! As to corporations, parishes, vestry-boards, and similar\\ngatherings of jolter-headed clods who assemble to exchange such\\nspeeches that, by heaven, they ought to be worked in quicksilver\\nmines for the short remainder of their miserable existence, if it\\nwere only to prevent their detestable English from contaminating a\\nlanguage spoken in the presence of the sun--as to those fellows, who\\nmeanly take advantage of the ardour of gentlemen in the pursuit of\\nknowledge to recompense the inestimable services of the best years of\\ntheir lives, their long study, and their expensive education with\\npittances too small for the acceptance of clerks, I would have the\\nnecks of every one of them wrung and their skulls arranged in\\nSurgeons\\' Hall for the contemplation of the whole profession in order\\nthat its younger members might understand from actual measurement, in\\nearly life, HOW thick skulls may become!\"\\n\\nHe wound up this vehement declaration by looking round upon us with a\\nmost agreeable smile and suddenly thundering, \"Ha, ha, ha!\" over and\\nover again, until anybody else might have been expected to be quite\\nsubdued by the exertion.\\n\\nAs Richard still continued to say that he was fixed in his choice\\nafter repeated periods for consideration had been recommended by Mr.\\nJarndyce and had expired, and he still continued to assure Ada and me\\nin the same final manner that it was \"all right,\" it became advisable\\nto take Mr. Kenge into council. Mr. Kenge, therefore, came down to\\ndinner one day, and leaned back in his chair, and turned his\\neye-glasses over and over, and spoke in a sonorous voice, and did\\nexactly what I remembered to have seen him do when I was a little\\ngirl.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Yes. Well! A very good profession, Mr.\\nJarndyce, a very good profession.\"\\n\\n\"The course of study and preparation requires to be diligently\\npursued,\" observed my guardian with a glance at Richard.\\n\\n\"Oh, no doubt,\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Diligently.\"\\n\\n\"But that being the case, more or less, with all pursuits that are\\nworth much,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"it is not a special consideration\\nwhich another choice would be likely to escape.\"\\n\\n\"Truly,\" said Mr. Kenge. \"And Mr. Richard Carstone, who has so\\nmeritoriously acquitted himself in the--shall I say the classic\\nshades?--in which his youth had been passed, will, no doubt, apply\\nthe habits, if not the principles and practice, of versification in\\nthat tongue in which a poet was said (unless I mistake) to be born,\\nnot made, to the more eminently practical field of action on which he\\nenters.\"\\n\\n\"You may rely upon it,\" said Richard in his off-hand manner, \"that I\\nshall go at it and do my best.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, Mr. Jarndyce!\" said Mr. Kenge, gently nodding his head.\\n\"Really, when we are assured by Mr. Richard that he means to go at it\\nand to do his best,\" nodding feelingly and smoothly over those\\nexpressions, \"I would submit to you that we have only to inquire into\\nthe best mode of carrying out the object of his ambition. Now, with\\nreference to placing Mr. Richard with some sufficiently eminent\\npractitioner. Is there any one in view at present?\"\\n\\n\"No one, Rick, I think?\" said my guardian.\\n\\n\"No one, sir,\" said Richard.\\n\\n\"Quite so!\" observed Mr. Kenge. \"As to situation, now. Is there any\\nparticular feeling on that head?\"\\n\\n\"N--no,\" said Richard.\\n\\n\"Quite so!\" observed Mr. Kenge again.\\n\\n\"I should like a little variety,\" said Richard; \"I mean a good range\\nof experience.\"\\n\\n\"Very requisite, no doubt,\" returned Mr. Kenge. \"I think this may be\\neasily arranged, Mr. Jarndyce? We have only, in the first place, to\\ndiscover a sufficiently eligible practitioner; and as soon as we make\\nour want--and shall I add, our ability to pay a premium?--known, our\\nonly difficulty will be in the selection of one from a large number.\\nWe have only, in the second place, to observe those little\\nformalities which are rendered necessary by our time of life and our\\nbeing under the guardianship of the court. We shall soon be--shall I\\nsay, in Mr. Richard\\'s own light-hearted manner, \\'going at it\\'--to our\\nheart\\'s content. It is a coincidence,\" said Mr. Kenge with a tinge of\\nmelancholy in his smile, \"one of those coincidences which may or may\\nnot require an explanation beyond our present limited faculties, that\\nI have a cousin in the medical profession. He might be deemed\\neligible by you and might be disposed to respond to this proposal. I\\ncan answer for him as little as for you, but he MIGHT!\"\\n\\nAs this was an opening in the prospect, it was arranged that Mr.\\nKenge should see his cousin. And as Mr. Jarndyce had before proposed\\nto take us to London for a few weeks, it was settled next day that we\\nshould make our visit at once and combine Richard\\'s business with it.\\n\\nMr. Boythorn leaving us within a week, we took up our abode at a\\ncheerful lodging near Oxford Street over an upholsterer\\'s shop.\\nLondon was a great wonder to us, and we were out for hours and hours\\nat a time, seeing the sights, which appeared to be less capable of\\nexhaustion than we were. We made the round of the principal theatres,\\ntoo, with great delight, and saw all the plays that were worth\\nseeing. I mention this because it was at the theatre that I began to\\nbe made uncomfortable again by Mr. Guppy.\\n\\nI was sitting in front of the box one night with Ada, and Richard was\\nin the place he liked best, behind Ada\\'s chair, when, happening to\\nlook down into the pit, I saw Mr. Guppy, with his hair flattened down\\nupon his head and woe depicted in his face, looking up at me. I felt\\nall through the performance that he never looked at the actors but\\nconstantly looked at me, and always with a carefully prepared\\nexpression of the deepest misery and the profoundest dejection.\\n\\nIt quite spoiled my pleasure for that night because it was so very\\nembarrassing and so very ridiculous. But from that time forth, we\\nnever went to the play without my seeing Mr. Guppy in the pit, always\\nwith his hair straight and flat, his shirt-collar turned down, and a\\ngeneral feebleness about him. If he were not there when we went in,\\nand I began to hope he would not come and yielded myself for a little\\nwhile to the interest of the scene, I was certain to encounter his\\nlanguishing eyes when I least expected it and, from that time, to be\\nquite sure that they were fixed upon me all the evening.\\n\\nI really cannot express how uneasy this made me. If he would only\\nhave brushed up his hair or turned up his collar, it would have been\\nbad enough; but to know that that absurd figure was always gazing at\\nme, and always in that demonstrative state of despondency, put such a\\nconstraint upon me that I did not like to laugh at the play, or to\\ncry at it, or to move, or to speak. I seemed able to do nothing\\nnaturally. As to escaping Mr. Guppy by going to the back of the box,\\nI could not bear to do that because I knew Richard and Ada relied on\\nhaving me next them and that they could never have talked together so\\nhappily if anybody else had been in my place. So there I sat, not\\nknowing where to look--for wherever I looked, I knew Mr. Guppy\\'s eyes\\nwere following me--and thinking of the dreadful expense to which this\\nyoung man was putting himself on my account.\\n\\nSometimes I thought of telling Mr. Jarndyce. Then I feared that the\\nyoung man would lose his situation and that I might ruin him.\\nSometimes I thought of confiding in Richard, but was deterred by the\\npossibility of his fighting Mr. Guppy and giving him black eyes.\\nSometimes I thought, should I frown at him or shake my head. Then I\\nfelt I could not do it. Sometimes I considered whether I should write\\nto his mother, but that ended in my being convinced that to open a\\ncorrespondence would be to make the matter worse. I always came to\\nthe conclusion, finally, that I could do nothing. Mr. Guppy\\'s\\nperseverance, all this time, not only produced him regularly at any\\ntheatre to which we went, but caused him to appear in the crowd as we\\nwere coming out, and even to get up behind our fly--where I am sure I\\nsaw him, two or three times, struggling among the most dreadful\\nspikes. After we got home, he haunted a post opposite our house. The\\nupholsterer\\'s where we lodged being at the corner of two streets, and\\nmy bedroom window being opposite the post, I was afraid to go near\\nthe window when I went upstairs, lest I should see him (as I did one\\nmoonlight night) leaning against the post and evidently catching\\ncold. If Mr. Guppy had not been, fortunately for me, engaged in the\\ndaytime, I really should have had no rest from him.\\n\\nWhile we were making this round of gaieties, in which Mr. Guppy so\\nextraordinarily participated, the business which had helped to bring\\nus to town was not neglected. Mr. Kenge\\'s cousin was a Mr. Bayham\\nBadger, who had a good practice at Chelsea and attended a large\\npublic institution besides. He was quite willing to receive Richard\\ninto his house and to superintend his studies, and as it seemed that\\nthose could be pursued advantageously under Mr. Badger\\'s roof, and\\nMr. Badger liked Richard, and as Richard said he liked Mr. Badger\\n\"well enough,\" an agreement was made, the Lord Chancellor\\'s consent\\nwas obtained, and it was all settled.\\n\\nOn the day when matters were concluded between Richard and Mr.\\nBadger, we were all under engagement to dine at Mr. Badger\\'s house.\\nWe were to be \"merely a family party,\" Mrs. Badger\\'s note said; and\\nwe found no lady there but Mrs. Badger herself. She was surrounded in\\nthe drawing-room by various objects, indicative of her painting a\\nlittle, playing the piano a little, playing the guitar a little,\\nplaying the harp a little, singing a little, working a little,\\nreading a little, writing poetry a little, and botanizing a little.\\nShe was a lady of about fifty, I should think, youthfully dressed,\\nand of a very fine complexion. If I add to the little list of her\\naccomplishments that she rouged a little, I do not mean that there\\nwas any harm in it.\\n\\nMr. Bayham Badger himself was a pink, fresh-faced, crisp-looking\\ngentleman with a weak voice, white teeth, light hair, and surprised\\neyes, some years younger, I should say, than Mrs. Bayham Badger. He\\nadmired her exceedingly, but principally, and to begin with, on the\\ncurious ground (as it seemed to us) of her having had three husbands.\\nWe had barely taken our seats when he said to Mr. Jarndyce quite\\ntriumphantly, \"You would hardly suppose that I am Mrs. Bayham\\nBadger\\'s third!\"\\n\\n\"Indeed?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Her third!\" said Mr. Badger. \"Mrs. Bayham Badger has not the\\nappearance, Miss Summerson, of a lady who has had two former\\nhusbands?\"\\n\\nI said \"Not at all!\"\\n\\n\"And most remarkable men!\" said Mr. Badger in a tone of confidence.\\n\"Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy, who was Mrs. Badger\\'s first\\nhusband, was a very distinguished officer indeed. The name of\\nProfessor Dingo, my immediate predecessor, is one of European\\nreputation.\"\\n\\nMrs. Badger overheard him and smiled.\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear!\" Mr. Badger replied to the smile, \"I was observing to\\nMr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson that you had had two former\\nhusbands--both very distinguished men. And they found it, as people\\ngenerally do, difficult to believe.\"\\n\\n\"I was barely twenty,\" said Mrs. Badger, \"when I married Captain\\nSwosser of the Royal Navy. I was in the Mediterranean with him; I am\\nquite a sailor. On the twelfth anniversary of my wedding-day, I\\nbecame the wife of Professor Dingo.\"\\n\\n\"Of European reputation,\" added Mr. Badger in an undertone.\\n\\n\"And when Mr. Badger and myself were married,\" pursued Mrs. Badger,\\n\"we were married on the same day of the year. I had become attached\\nto the day.\"\\n\\n\"So that Mrs. Badger has been married to three husbands--two of them\\nhighly distinguished men,\" said Mr. Badger, summing up the facts,\\n\"and each time upon the twenty-first of March at eleven in the\\nforenoon!\"\\n\\nWe all expressed our admiration.\\n\\n\"But for Mr. Badger\\'s modesty,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"I would take\\nleave to correct him and say three distinguished men.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Mr. Jarndyce! What I always tell him!\" observed Mrs.\\nBadger.\\n\\n\"And, my dear,\" said Mr. Badger, \"what do I always tell you? That\\nwithout any affectation of disparaging such professional distinction\\nas I may have attained (which our friend Mr. Carstone will have many\\nopportunities of estimating), I am not so weak--no, really,\" said Mr.\\nBadger to us generally, \"so unreasonable--as to put my reputation on\\nthe same footing with such first-rate men as Captain Swosser and\\nProfessor Dingo. Perhaps you may be interested, Mr. Jarndyce,\"\\ncontinued Mr. Bayham Badger, leading the way into the next\\ndrawing-room, \"in this portrait of Captain Swosser. It was taken on\\nhis return home from the African station, where he had suffered from\\nthe fever of the country. Mrs. Badger considers it too yellow. But\\nit\\'s a very fine head. A very fine head!\"\\n\\nWe all echoed, \"A very fine head!\"\\n\\n\"I feel when I look at it,\" said Mr. Badger, \"\\'That\\'s a man I should\\nlike to have seen!\\' It strikingly bespeaks the first-class man that\\nCaptain Swosser pre-eminently was. On the other side, Professor\\nDingo. I knew him well--attended him in his last illness--a speaking\\nlikeness! Over the piano, Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Swosser. Over\\nthe sofa, Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Dingo. Of Mrs. Bayham Badger\\nIN ESSE, I possess the original and have no copy.\"\\n\\nDinner was now announced, and we went downstairs. It was a very\\ngenteel entertainment, very handsomely served. But the captain and\\nthe professor still ran in Mr. Badger\\'s head, and as Ada and I had\\nthe honour of being under his particular care, we had the full\\nbenefit of them.\\n\\n\"Water, Miss Summerson? Allow me! Not in that tumbler, pray. Bring me\\nthe professor\\'s goblet, James!\"\\n\\nAda very much admired some artificial flowers under a glass.\\n\\n\"Astonishing how they keep!\" said Mr. Badger. \"They were presented to\\nMrs. Bayham Badger when she was in the Mediterranean.\"\\n\\nHe invited Mr. Jarndyce to take a glass of claret.\\n\\n\"Not that claret!\" he said. \"Excuse me! This is an occasion, and ON\\nan occasion I produce some very special claret I happen to have.\\n(James, Captain Swosser\\'s wine!) Mr. Jarndyce, this is a wine that\\nwas imported by the captain, we will not say how many years ago. You\\nwill find it very curious. My dear, I shall be happy to take some of\\nthis wine with you. (Captain Swosser\\'s claret to your mistress,\\nJames!) My love, your health!\"\\n\\nAfter dinner, when we ladies retired, we took Mrs. Badger\\'s first and\\nsecond husband with us. Mrs. Badger gave us in the drawing-room a\\nbiographical sketch of the life and services of Captain Swosser\\nbefore his marriage and a more minute account of him dating from the\\ntime when he fell in love with her at a ball on board the Crippler,\\ngiven to the officers of that ship when she lay in Plymouth Harbour.\\n\\n\"The dear old Crippler!\" said Mrs. Badger, shaking her head. \"She was\\na noble vessel. Trim, ship-shape, all a taunto, as Captain Swosser\\nused to say. You must excuse me if I occasionally introduce a\\nnautical expression; I was quite a sailor once. Captain Swosser loved\\nthat craft for my sake. When she was no longer in commission, he\\nfrequently said that if he were rich enough to buy her old hulk, he\\nwould have an inscription let into the timbers of the quarter-deck\\nwhere we stood as partners in the dance to mark the spot where he\\nfell--raked fore and aft (Captain Swosser used to say) by the fire\\nfrom my tops. It was his naval way of mentioning my eyes.\"\\n\\nMrs. Badger shook her head, sighed, and looked in the glass.\\n\\n\"It was a great change from Captain Swosser to Professor Dingo,\" she\\nresumed with a plaintive smile. \"I felt it a good deal at first. Such\\nan entire revolution in my mode of life! But custom, combined with\\nscience--particularly science--inured me to it. Being the professor\\'s\\nsole companion in his botanical excursions, I almost forgot that I\\nhad ever been afloat, and became quite learned. It is singular that\\nthe professor was the antipodes of Captain Swosser and that Mr.\\nBadger is not in the least like either!\"\\n\\nWe then passed into a narrative of the deaths of Captain Swosser and\\nProfessor Dingo, both of whom seem to have had very bad complaints.\\nIn the course of it, Mrs. Badger signified to us that she had never\\nmadly loved but once and that the object of that wild affection,\\nnever to be recalled in its fresh enthusiasm, was Captain Swosser.\\nThe professor was yet dying by inches in the most dismal manner, and\\nMrs. Badger was giving us imitations of his way of saying, with great\\ndifficulty, \"Where is Laura? Let Laura give me my toast and water!\"\\nwhen the entrance of the gentlemen consigned him to the tomb.\\n\\nNow, I observed that evening, as I had observed for some days past,\\nthat Ada and Richard were more than ever attached to each other\\'s\\nsociety, which was but natural, seeing that they were going to be\\nseparated so soon. I was therefore not very much surprised when we\\ngot home, and Ada and I retired upstairs, to find Ada more silent\\nthan usual, though I was not quite prepared for her coming into my\\narms and beginning to speak to me, with her face hidden.\\n\\n\"My darling Esther!\" murmured Ada. \"I have a great secret to tell\\nyou!\"\\n\\nA mighty secret, my pretty one, no doubt!\\n\\n\"What is it, Ada?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Esther, you would never guess!\"\\n\\n\"Shall I try to guess?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh, no! Don\\'t! Pray don\\'t!\" cried Ada, very much startled by the\\nidea of my doing so.\\n\\n\"Now, I wonder who it can be about?\" said I, pretending to consider.\\n\\n\"It\\'s about--\" said Ada in a whisper. \"It\\'s about--my cousin\\nRichard!\"\\n\\n\"Well, my own!\" said I, kissing her bright hair, which was all I\\ncould see. \"And what about him?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Esther, you would never guess!\"\\n\\nIt was so pretty to have her clinging to me in that way, hiding her\\nface, and to know that she was not crying in sorrow but in a little\\nglow of joy, and pride, and hope, that I would not help her just yet.\\n\\n\"He says--I know it\\'s very foolish, we are both so young--but he\\nsays,\" with a burst of tears, \"that he loves me dearly, Esther.\"\\n\\n\"Does he indeed?\" said I. \"I never heard of such a thing! Why, my pet\\nof pets, I could have told you that weeks and weeks ago!\"\\n\\nTo see Ada lift up her flushed face in joyful surprise, and hold me\\nround the neck, and laugh, and cry, and blush, was so pleasant!\\n\\n\"Why, my darling,\" said I, \"what a goose you must take me for! Your\\ncousin Richard has been loving you as plainly as he could for I don\\'t\\nknow how long!\"\\n\\n\"And yet you never said a word about it!\" cried Ada, kissing me.\\n\\n\"No, my love,\" said I. \"I waited to be told.\"\\n\\n\"But now I have told you, you don\\'t think it wrong of me, do you?\"\\nreturned Ada. She might have coaxed me to say no if I had been the\\nhardest-hearted duenna in the world. Not being that yet, I said no\\nvery freely.\\n\\n\"And now,\" said I, \"I know the worst of it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s not quite the worst of it, Esther dear!\" cried Ada,\\nholding me tighter and laying down her face again upon my breast.\\n\\n\"No?\" said I. \"Not even that?\"\\n\\n\"No, not even that!\" said Ada, shaking her head.\\n\\n\"Why, you never mean to say--\" I was beginning in joke.\\n\\nBut Ada, looking up and smiling through her tears, cried, \"Yes, I do!\\nYou know, you know I do!\" And then sobbed out, \"With all my heart I\\ndo! With all my whole heart, Esther!\"\\n\\nI told her, laughing, why I had known that, too, just as well as I\\nhad known the other! And we sat before the fire, and I had all the\\ntalking to myself for a little while (though there was not much of\\nit); and Ada was soon quiet and happy.\\n\\n\"Do you think my cousin John knows, dear Dame Durden?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Unless my cousin John is blind, my pet,\" said I, \"I should think my\\ncousin John knows pretty well as much as we know.\"\\n\\n\"We want to speak to him before Richard goes,\" said Ada timidly, \"and\\nwe wanted you to advise us, and to tell him so. Perhaps you wouldn\\'t\\nmind Richard\\'s coming in, Dame Durden?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Richard is outside, is he, my dear?\" said I.\\n\\n\"I am not quite certain,\" returned Ada with a bashful simplicity that\\nwould have won my heart if she had not won it long before, \"but I\\nthink he\\'s waiting at the door.\"\\n\\nThere he was, of course. They brought a chair on either side of me,\\nand put me between them, and really seemed to have fallen in love\\nwith me instead of one another, they were so confiding, and so\\ntrustful, and so fond of me. They went on in their own wild way for a\\nlittle while--I never stopped them; I enjoyed it too much myself--and\\nthen we gradually fell to considering how young they were, and how\\nthere must be a lapse of several years before this early love could\\ncome to anything, and how it could come to happiness only if it were\\nreal and lasting and inspired them with a steady resolution to do\\ntheir duty to each other, with constancy, fortitude, and\\nperseverance, each always for the other\\'s sake. Well! Richard said\\nthat he would work his fingers to the bone for Ada, and Ada said that\\nshe would work her fingers to the bone for Richard, and they called\\nme all sorts of endearing and sensible names, and we sat there,\\nadvising and talking, half the night. Finally, before we parted, I\\ngave them my promise to speak to their cousin John to-morrow.\\n\\nSo, when to-morrow came, I went to my guardian after breakfast, in\\nthe room that was our town-substitute for the growlery, and told him\\nthat I had it in trust to tell him something.\\n\\n\"Well, little woman,\" said he, shutting up his book, \"if you have\\naccepted the trust, there can be no harm in it.\"\\n\\n\"I hope not, guardian,\" said I. \"I can guarantee that there is no\\nsecrecy in it. For it only happened yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"Aye? And what is it, Esther?\"\\n\\n\"Guardian,\" said I, \"you remember the happy night when first we came\\ndown to Bleak House? When Ada was singing in the dark room?\"\\n\\nI wished to call to his remembrance the look he had given me then.\\nUnless I am much mistaken, I saw that I did so.\\n\\n\"Because--\" said I with a little hesitation.\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear!\" said he. \"Don\\'t hurry.\"\\n\\n\"Because,\" said I, \"Ada and Richard have fallen in love. And have\\ntold each other so.\"\\n\\n\"Already!\" cried my guardian, quite astonished.\\n\\n\"Yes!\" said I. \"And to tell you the truth, guardian, I rather\\nexpected it.\"\\n\\n\"The deuce you did!\" said he.\\n\\nHe sat considering for a minute or two, with his smile, at once so\\nhandsome and so kind, upon his changing face, and then requested me\\nto let them know that he wished to see them. When they came, he\\nencircled Ada with one arm in his fatherly way and addressed himself\\nto Richard with a cheerful gravity.\\n\\n\"Rick,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"I am glad to have won your confidence. I\\nhope to preserve it. When I contemplated these relations between us\\nfour which have so brightened my life and so invested it with new\\ninterests and pleasures, I certainly did contemplate, afar off, the\\npossibility of you and your pretty cousin here (don\\'t be shy, Ada,\\ndon\\'t be shy, my dear!) being in a mind to go through life together.\\nI saw, and do see, many reasons to make it desirable. But that was\\nafar off, Rick, afar off!\"\\n\\n\"We look afar off, sir,\" returned Richard.\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"That\\'s rational. Now, hear me, my dears!\\nI might tell you that you don\\'t know your own minds yet, that a\\nthousand things may happen to divert you from one another, that it is\\nwell this chain of flowers you have taken up is very easily broken,\\nor it might become a chain of lead. But I will not do that. Such\\nwisdom will come soon enough, I dare say, if it is to come at all. I\\nwill assume that a few years hence you will be in your hearts to one\\nanother what you are to-day. All I say before speaking to you\\naccording to that assumption is, if you DO change--if you DO come to\\nfind that you are more commonplace cousins to each other as man and\\nwoman than you were as boy and girl (your manhood will excuse me,\\nRick!)--don\\'t be ashamed still to confide in me, for there will be\\nnothing monstrous or uncommon in it. I am only your friend and\\ndistant kinsman. I have no power over you whatever. But I wish and\\nhope to retain your confidence if I do nothing to forfeit it.\"\\n\\n\"I am very sure, sir,\" returned Richard, \"that I speak for Ada too\\nwhen I say that you have the strongest power over us both--rooted in\\nrespect, gratitude, and affection--strengthening every day.\"\\n\\n\"Dear cousin John,\" said Ada, on his shoulder, \"my father\\'s place can\\nnever be empty again. All the love and duty I could ever have\\nrendered to him is transferred to you.\"\\n\\n\"Come!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"Now for our assumption. Now we lift our\\neyes up and look hopefully at the distance! Rick, the world is before\\nyou; and it is most probable that as you enter it, so it will receive\\nyou. Trust in nothing but in Providence and your own efforts. Never\\nseparate the two, like the heathen waggoner. Constancy in love is a\\ngood thing, but it means nothing, and is nothing, without constancy\\nin every kind of effort. If you had the abilities of all the great\\nmen, past and present, you could do nothing well without sincerely\\nmeaning it and setting about it. If you entertain the supposition\\nthat any real success, in great things or in small, ever was or could\\nbe, ever will or can be, wrested from Fortune by fits and starts,\\nleave that wrong idea here or leave your cousin Ada here.\"\\n\\n\"I will leave IT here, sir,\" replied Richard smiling, \"if I brought\\nit here just now (but I hope I did not), and will work my way on to\\nmy cousin Ada in the hopeful distance.\"\\n\\n\"Right!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"If you are not to make her happy, why\\nshould you pursue her?\"\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t make her unhappy--no, not even for her love,\" retorted\\nRichard proudly.\\n\\n\"Well said!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce. \"That\\'s well said! She remains here,\\nin her home with me. Love her, Rick, in your active life, no less\\nthan in her home when you revisit it, and all will go well.\\nOtherwise, all will go ill. That\\'s the end of my preaching. I think\\nyou and Ada had better take a walk.\"\\n\\nAda tenderly embraced him, and Richard heartily shook hands with him,\\nand then the cousins went out of the room, looking back again\\ndirectly, though, to say that they would wait for me.\\n\\nThe door stood open, and we both followed them with our eyes as they\\npassed down the adjoining room, on which the sun was shining, and out\\nat its farther end. Richard with his head bent, and her hand drawn\\nthrough his arm, was talking to her very earnestly; and she looked up\\nin his face, listening, and seemed to see nothing else. So young, so\\nbeautiful, so full of hope and promise, they went on lightly through\\nthe sunlight as their own happy thoughts might then be traversing the\\nyears to come and making them all years of brightness. So they passed\\naway into the shadow and were gone. It was only a burst of light that\\nhad been so radiant. The room darkened as they went out, and the sun\\nwas clouded over.\\n\\n\"Am I right, Esther?\" said my guardian when they were gone.\\n\\nHe was so good and wise to ask ME whether he was right!\\n\\n\"Rick may gain, out of this, the quality he wants. Wants, at the core\\nof so much that is good!\" said Mr. Jarndyce, shaking his head. \"I\\nhave said nothing to Ada, Esther. She has her friend and counsellor\\nalways near.\" And he laid his hand lovingly upon my head.\\n\\nI could not help showing that I was a little moved, though I did all\\nI could to conceal it.\\n\\n\"Tut tut!\" said he. \"But we must take care, too, that our little\\nwoman\\'s life is not all consumed in care for others.\"\\n\\n\"Care? My dear guardian, I believe I am the happiest creature in the\\nworld!\"\\n\\n\"I believe so, too,\" said he. \"But some one may find out what Esther\\nnever will--that the little woman is to be held in remembrance above\\nall other people!\"\\n\\nI have omitted to mention in its place that there was some one else\\nat the family dinner party. It was not a lady. It was a gentleman. It\\nwas a gentleman of a dark complexion--a young surgeon. He was rather\\nreserved, but I thought him very sensible and agreeable. At least,\\nAda asked me if I did not, and I said yes.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'model_output': \" The text describes several events and characters related to the Jarndyce and Jarndyce court case.

It touched me then to reflect, and it touches me now, more\\nnearly, to remember (having what I have to tell) how they both\\nthought of me, even at that engrossing time. I was a part of all\\ntheir plans, for the present and the future. I was to write Richard\\nonce a week, making my faithful report of Ada, who was to write to\\nhim every alternate day. I was to be informed, under his own hand, of\\nall his labours and successes; I was to observe how resolute and\\npersevering he would be; I was to be Ada\\'s bridesmaid when they were\\nmarried; I was to live with them afterwards; I was to keep all the\\nkeys of their house; I was to be made happy for ever and a day.\\n\\n\"And if the suit SHOULD make us rich, Esther--which it may, you\\nknow!\" said Richard to crown all.\\n\\nA shade crossed Ada\\'s face.\\n\\n\"My dearest Ada,\" asked Richard, \"why not?\"\\n\\n\"It had better declare us poor at once,\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"Oh! I don\\'t know about that,\" returned Richard, \"but at all events,\\nit won\\'t declare anything at once. It hasn\\'t declared anything in\\nheaven knows how many years.\"\\n\\n\"Too true,\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"Yes, but,\" urged Richard, answering what her look suggested rather\\nthan her words, \"the longer it goes on, dear cousin, the nearer it\\nmust be to a settlement one way or other. Now, is not that\\nreasonable?\"\\n\\n\"You know best, Richard. But I am afraid if we trust to it, it will\\nmake us unhappy.\"\\n\\n\"But, my Ada, we are not going to trust to it!\" cried Richard gaily.\\n\"We know it better than to trust to it. We only say that if it SHOULD\\nmake us rich, we have no constitutional objection to being rich. The\\ncourt is, by solemn settlement of law, our grim old guardian, and we\\nare to suppose that what it gives us (when it gives us anything) is\\nour right. It is not necessary to quarrel with our right.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ada, \"but it may be better to forget all about it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well,\" cried Richard, \"then we will forget all about it! We\\nconsign the whole thing to oblivion. Dame Durden puts on her\\napproving face, and it\\'s done!\"\\n\\n\"Dame Durden\\'s approving face,\" said I, looking out of the box in\\nwhich I was packing his books, \"was not very visible when you called\\nit by that name; but it does approve, and she thinks you can\\'t do\\nbetter.\"\\n\\nSo, Richard said there was an end of it, and immediately began, on no\\nother foundation, to build as many castles in the air as would man\\nthe Great Wall of China. He went away in high spirits. Ada and I,\\nprepared to miss him very much, commenced our quieter career.\\n\\nOn our arrival in London, we had called with Mr. Jarndyce at Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s but had not been so fortunate as to find her at home. It\\nappeared that she had gone somewhere to a tea-drinking and had taken\\nMiss Jellyby with her. Besides the tea-drinking, there was to be some\\nconsiderable speech-making and letter-writing on the general merits\\nof the cultivation of coffee, conjointly with natives, at the\\nSettlement of Borrioboola-Gha. All this involved, no doubt,\\nsufficient active exercise of pen and ink to make her daughter\\'s part\\nin the proceedings anything but a holiday.\\n\\nIt being now beyond the time appointed for Mrs. Jellyby\\'s return, we\\ncalled again. She was in town, but not at home, having gone to Mile\\nEnd directly after breakfast on some Borrioboolan business, arising\\nout of a society called the East London Branch Aid Ramification. As I\\nhad not seen Peepy on the occasion of our last call (when he was not\\nto be found anywhere, and when the cook rather thought he must have\\nstrolled away with the dustman\\'s cart), I now inquired for him again.\\nThe oyster shells he had been building a house with were still in the\\npassage, but he was nowhere discoverable, and the cook supposed that\\nhe had \"gone after the sheep.\" When we repeated, with some surprise,\\n\"The sheep?\" she said, Oh, yes, on market days he sometimes followed\\nthem quite out of town and came back in such a state as never was!\\n\\nI was sitting at the window with my guardian on the following\\nmorning, and Ada was busy writing--of course to Richard--when Miss\\nJellyby was announced, and entered, leading the identical Peepy, whom\\nshe had made some endeavours to render presentable by wiping the dirt\\ninto corners of his face and hands and making his hair very wet and\\nthen violently frizzling it with her fingers. Everything the dear\\nchild wore was either too large for him or too small. Among his other\\ncontradictory decorations he had the hat of a bishop and the little\\ngloves of a baby. His boots were, on a small scale, the boots of a\\nploughman, while his legs, so crossed and recrossed with scratches\\nthat they looked like maps, were bare below a very short pair of\\nplaid drawers finished off with two frills of perfectly different\\npatterns. The deficient buttons on his plaid frock had evidently been\\nsupplied from one of Mr. Jellyby\\'s coats, they were so extremely\\nbrazen and so much too large. Most extraordinary specimens of\\nneedlework appeared on several parts of his dress, where it had been\\nhastily mended, and I recognized the same hand on Miss Jellyby\\'s. She\\nwas, however, unaccountably improved in her appearance and looked\\nvery pretty. She was conscious of poor little Peepy being but a\\nfailure after all her trouble, and she showed it as she came in by\\nthe way in which she glanced first at him and then at us.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear me!\" said my guardian. \"Due east!\"\\n\\nAda and I gave her a cordial welcome and presented her to Mr.\\nJarndyce, to whom she said as she sat down, \"Ma\\'s compliments, and\\nshe hopes you\\'ll excuse her, because she\\'s correcting proofs of the\\nplan. She\\'s going to put out five thousand new circulars, and she\\nknows you\\'ll be interested to hear that. I have brought one of them\\nwith me. Ma\\'s compliments.\" With which she presented it sulkily\\nenough.\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said my guardian. \"I am much obliged to Mrs. Jellyby.\\nOh, dear me! This is a very trying wind!\"\\n\\nWe were busy with Peepy, taking off his clerical hat, asking him if\\nhe remembered us, and so on. Peepy retired behind his elbow at first,\\nbut relented at the sight of sponge-cake and allowed me to take him\\non my lap, where he sat munching quietly. Mr. Jarndyce then\\nwithdrawing into the temporary growlery, Miss Jellyby opened a\\nconversation with her usual abruptness.\\n\\n\"We are going on just as bad as ever in Thavies Inn,\" said she. \"I\\nhave no peace of my life. Talk of Africa! I couldn\\'t be worse off if\\nI was a what\\'s-his-name--man and a brother!\"\\n\\nI tried to say something soothing.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s of no use, Miss Summerson,\" exclaimed Miss Jellyby, \"though\\nI thank you for the kind intention all the same. I know how I am\\nused, and I am not to be talked over. YOU wouldn\\'t be talked over if\\nyou were used so. Peepy, go and play at Wild Beasts under the piano!\"\\n\\n\"I shan\\'t!\" said Peepy.\\n\\n\"Very well, you ungrateful, naughty, hard-hearted boy!\" returned Miss\\nJellyby with tears in her eyes. \"I\\'ll never take pains to dress you\\nany more.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I will go, Caddy!\" cried Peepy, who was really a good child and\\nwho was so moved by his sister\\'s vexation that he went at once.\\n\\n\"It seems a little thing to cry about,\" said poor Miss Jellyby\\napologetically, \"but I am quite worn out. I was directing the new\\ncirculars till two this morning. I detest the whole thing so that\\nthat alone makes my head ache till I can\\'t see out of my eyes. And\\nlook at that poor unfortunate child! Was there ever such a fright as\\nhe is!\"\\n\\nPeepy, happily unconscious of the defects in his appearance, sat on\\nthe carpet behind one of the legs of the piano, looking calmly out of\\nhis den at us while he ate his cake.\\n\\n\"I have sent him to the other end of the room,\" observed Miss\\nJellyby, drawing her chair nearer ours, \"because I don\\'t want him to\\nhear the conversation. Those little things are so sharp! I was going\\nto say, we really are going on worse than ever. Pa will be a bankrupt\\nbefore long, and then I hope Ma will be satisfied. There\\'ll he nobody\\nbut Ma to thank for it.\"\\n\\nWe said we hoped Mr. Jellyby\\'s affairs were not in so bad a state as\\nthat.\\n\\n\"It\\'s of no use hoping, though it\\'s very kind of you,\" returned Miss\\nJellyby, shaking her head. \"Pa told me only yesterday morning (and\\ndreadfully unhappy he is) that he couldn\\'t weather the storm. I\\nshould be surprised if he could. When all our tradesmen send into our\\nhouse any stuff they like, and the servants do what they like with\\nit, and I have no time to improve things if I knew how, and Ma don\\'t\\ncare about anything, I should like to make out how Pa is to weather\\nthe storm. I declare if I was Pa, I\\'d run away.\"\\n\\n\"My dear!\" said I, smiling. \"Your papa, no doubt, considers his\\nfamily.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, his family is all very fine, Miss Summerson,\" replied Miss\\nJellyby; \"but what comfort is his family to him? His family is\\nnothing but bills, dirt, waste, noise, tumbles downstairs, confusion,\\nand wretchedness. His scrambling home, from week\\'s end to week\\'s end,\\nis like one great washing-day--only nothing\\'s washed!\"\\n\\nMiss Jellyby tapped her foot upon the floor and wiped her eyes.\\n\\n\"I am sure I pity Pa to that degree,\" she said, \"and am so angry with\\nMa that I can\\'t find words to express myself! However, I am not going\\nto bear it, I am determined. I won\\'t be a slave all my life, and I\\nwon\\'t submit to be proposed to by Mr. Quale. A pretty thing, indeed,\\nto marry a philanthropist. As if I hadn\\'t had enough of THAT!\" said\\npoor Miss Jellyby.\\n\\nI must confess that I could not help feeling rather angry with Mrs.\\nJellyby myself, seeing and hearing this neglected girl and knowing\\nhow much of bitterly satirical truth there was in what she said.\\n\\n\"If it wasn\\'t that we had been intimate when you stopped at our\\nhouse,\" pursued Miss Jellyby, \"I should have been ashamed to come\\nhere to-day, for I know what a figure I must seem to you two. But as\\nit is, I made up my mind to call, especially as I am not likely to\\nsee you again the next time you come to town.\"\\n\\nShe said this with such great significance that Ada and I glanced at\\none another, foreseeing something more.\\n\\n\"No!\" said Miss Jellyby, shaking her head. \"Not at all likely! I know\\nI may trust you two. I am sure you won\\'t betray me. I am engaged.\"\\n\\n\"Without their knowledge at home?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Why, good gracious me, Miss Summerson,\" she returned, justifying\\nherself in a fretful but not angry manner, \"how can it be otherwise?\\nYou know what Ma is--and I needn\\'t make poor Pa more miserable by\\ntelling HIM.\"\\n\\n\"But would it not be adding to his unhappiness to marry without his\\nknowledge or consent, my dear?\" said I.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Miss Jellyby, softening. \"I hope not. I should try to make\\nhim happy and comfortable when he came to see me, and Peepy and the\\nothers should take it in turns to come and stay with me, and they\\nshould have some care taken of them then.\"\\n\\nThere was a good deal of affection in poor Caddy. She softened more\\nand more while saying this and cried so much over the unwonted little\\nhome-picture she had raised in her mind that Peepy, in his cave under\\nthe piano, was touched, and turned himself over on his back with loud\\nlamentations. It was not until I had brought him to kiss his sister,\\nand had restored him to his place on my lap, and had shown him that\\nCaddy was laughing (she laughed expressly for the purpose), that we\\ncould recall his peace of mind; even then it was for some time\\nconditional on his taking us in turns by the chin and smoothing our\\nfaces all over with his hand. At last, as his spirits were not equal\\nto the piano, we put him on a chair to look out of window; and Miss\\nJellyby, holding him by one leg, resumed her confidence.\\n\\n\"It began in your coming to our house,\" she said.\\n\\nWe naturally asked how.\\n\\n\"I felt I was so awkward,\" she replied, \"that I made up my mind to be\\nimproved in that respect at all events and to learn to dance. I told\\nMa I was ashamed of myself, and I must be taught to dance. Ma looked\\nat me in that provoking way of hers as if I wasn\\'t in sight, but I\\nwas quite determined to be taught to dance, and so I went to Mr.\\nTurveydrop\\'s Academy in Newman Street.\"\\n\\n\"And was it there, my dear--\" I began.\\n\\n\"Yes, it was there,\" said Caddy, \"and I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop.\\nThere are two Mr. Turveydrops, father and son. My Mr. Turveydrop is\\nthe son, of course. I only wish I had been better brought up and was\\nlikely to make him a better wife, for I am very fond of him.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry to hear this,\" said I, \"I must confess.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know why you should be sorry,\" she retorted a little\\nanxiously, \"but I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop, whether or no, and he\\nis very fond of me. It\\'s a secret as yet, even on his side, because\\nold Mr. Turveydrop has a share in the connexion and it might break\\nhis heart or give him some other shock if he was told of it abruptly.\\nOld Mr. Turveydrop is a very gentlemanly man indeed--very\\ngentlemanly.\"\\n\\n\"Does his wife know of it?\" asked Ada.\\n\\n\"Old Mr. Turveydrop\\'s wife, Miss Clare?\" returned Miss Jellyby,\\nopening her eyes. \"There\\'s no such person. He is a widower.\"\\n\\nWe were here interrupted by Peepy, whose leg had undergone so much on\\naccount of his sister\\'s unconsciously jerking it like a bell-rope\\nwhenever she was emphatic that the afflicted child now bemoaned his\\nsufferings with a very low-spirited noise. As he appealed to me for\\ncompassion, and as I was only a listener, I undertook to hold him.\\nMiss Jellyby proceeded, after begging Peepy\\'s pardon with a kiss and\\nassuring him that she hadn\\'t meant to do it.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the state of the case,\" said Caddy. \"If I ever blame myself,\\nI still think it\\'s Ma\\'s fault. We are to be married whenever we can,\\nand then I shall go to Pa at the office and write to Ma. It won\\'t\\nmuch agitate Ma; I am only pen and ink to HER. One great comfort is,\"\\nsaid Caddy with a sob, \"that I shall never hear of Africa after I am\\nmarried. Young Mr. Turveydrop hates it for my sake, and if old Mr.\\nTurveydrop knows there is such a place, it\\'s as much as he does.\"\\n\\n\"It was he who was very gentlemanly, I think!\" said I.\\n\\n\"Very gentlemanly indeed,\" said Caddy. \"He is celebrated almost\\neverywhere for his deportment.\"\\n\\n\"Does he teach?\" asked Ada.\\n\\n\"No, he don\\'t teach anything in particular,\" replied Caddy. \"But his\\ndeportment is beautiful.\"\\n\\nCaddy went on to say with considerable hesitation and reluctance that\\nthere was one thing more she wished us to know, and felt we ought to\\nknow, and which she hoped would not offend us. It was that she had\\nimproved her acquaintance with Miss Flite, the little crazy old lady,\\nand that she frequently went there early in the morning and met her\\nlover for a few minutes before breakfast--only for a few minutes. \"I\\ngo there at other times,\" said Caddy, \"but Prince does not come then.\\nYoung Mr. Turveydrop\\'s name is Prince; I wish it wasn\\'t, because it\\nsounds like a dog, but of course he didn\\'t christen himself. Old Mr.\\nTurveydrop had him christened Prince in remembrance of the Prince\\nRegent. Old Mr. Turveydrop adored the Prince Regent on account of his\\ndeportment. I hope you won\\'t think the worse of me for having made\\nthese little appointments at Miss Flite\\'s, where I first went with\\nyou, because I like the poor thing for her own sake and I believe she\\nlikes me. If you could see young Mr. Turveydrop, I am sure you would\\nthink well of him--at least, I am sure you couldn\\'t possibly think\\nany ill of him. I am going there now for my lesson. I couldn\\'t ask\\nyou to go with me, Miss Summerson; but if you would,\" said Caddy, who\\nhad said all this earnestly and tremblingly, \"I should be very\\nglad--very glad.\"\\n\\nIt happened that we had arranged with my guardian to go to Miss\\nFlite\\'s that day. We had told him of our former visit, and our\\naccount had interested him; but something had always happened to\\nprevent our going there again. As I trusted that I might have\\nsufficient influence with Miss Jellyby to prevent her taking any very\\nrash step if I fully accepted the confidence she was so willing to\\nplace in me, poor girl, I proposed that she and I and Peepy should go\\nto the academy and afterwards meet my guardian and Ada at Miss\\nFlite\\'s, whose name I now learnt for the first time. This was on\\ncondition that Miss Jellyby and Peepy should come back with us to\\ndinner. The last article of the agreement being joyfully acceded to\\nby both, we smartened Peepy up a little with the assistance of a few\\npins, some soap and water, and a hair-brush, and went out, bending\\nour steps towards Newman Street, which was very near.\\n\\nI found the academy established in a sufficiently dingy house at the\\ncorner of an archway, with busts in all the staircase windows. In the\\nsame house there were also established, as I gathered from the plates\\non the door, a drawing-master, a coal-merchant (there was, certainly,\\nno room for his coals), and a lithographic artist. On the plate\\nwhich, in size and situation, took precedence of all the rest, I\\nread, MR. TURVEYDROP. The door was open, and the hall was blocked up\\nby a grand piano, a harp, and several other musical instruments in\\ncases, all in progress of removal, and all looking rakish in the\\ndaylight. Miss Jellyby informed me that the academy had been lent,\\nlast night, for a concert.\\n\\nWe went upstairs--it had been quite a fine house once, when it was\\nanybody\\'s business to keep it clean and fresh, and nobody\\'s business\\nto smoke in it all day--and into Mr. Turveydrop\\'s great room, which\\nwas built out into a mews at the back and was lighted by a skylight.\\nIt was a bare, resounding room smelling of stables, with cane forms\\nalong the walls, and the walls ornamented at regular intervals with\\npainted lyres and little cut-glass branches for candles, which seemed\\nto be shedding their old-fashioned drops as other branches might shed\\nautumn leaves. Several young lady pupils, ranging from thirteen or\\nfourteen years of age to two or three and twenty, were assembled; and\\nI was looking among them for their instructor when Caddy, pinching my\\narm, repeated the ceremony of introduction. \"Miss Summerson, Mr.\\nPrince Turveydrop!\"\\n\\nI curtsied to a little blue-eyed fair man of youthful appearance with\\nflaxen hair parted in the middle and curling at the ends all round\\nhis head. He had a little fiddle, which we used to call at school a\\nkit, under his left arm, and its little bow in the same hand. His\\nlittle dancing-shoes were particularly diminutive, and he had a\\nlittle innocent, feminine manner which not only appealed to me in an\\namiable way, but made this singular effect upon me, that I received\\nthe impression that he was like his mother and that his mother had\\nnot been much considered or well used.\\n\\n\"I am very happy to see Miss Jellyby\\'s friend,\" he said, bowing low\\nto me. \"I began to fear,\" with timid tenderness, \"as it was past the\\nusual time, that Miss Jellyby was not coming.\"\\n\\n\"I beg you will have the goodness to attribute that to me, who have\\ndetained her, and to receive my excuses, sir,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear!\" said he.\\n\\n\"And pray,\" I entreated, \"do not allow me to be the cause of any more\\ndelay.\"\\n\\nWith that apology I withdrew to a seat between Peepy (who, being well\\nused to it, had already climbed into a corner place) and an old lady\\nof a censorious countenance whose two nieces were in the class and\\nwho was very indignant with Peepy\\'s boots. Prince Turveydrop then\\ntinkled the strings of his kit with his fingers, and the young ladies\\nstood up to dance. Just then there appeared from a side-door old Mr.\\nTurveydrop, in the full lustre of his deportment.\\n\\nHe was a fat old gentleman with a false complexion, false teeth,\\nfalse whiskers, and a wig. He had a fur collar, and he had a padded\\nbreast to his coat, which only wanted a star or a broad blue ribbon\\nto be complete. He was pinched in, and swelled out, and got up, and\\nstrapped down, as much as he could possibly bear. He had such a\\nneckcloth on (puffing his very eyes out of their natural shape), and\\nhis chin and even his ears so sunk into it, that it seemed as though\\nhe must inevitably double up if it were cast loose. He had under his\\narm a hat of great size and weight, shelving downward from the crown\\nto the brim, and in his hand a pair of white gloves with which he\\nflapped it as he stood poised on one leg in a high-shouldered,\\nround-elbowed state of elegance not to be surpassed. He had a cane,\\nhe had an eye-glass, he had a snuff-box, he had rings, he had\\nwristbands, he had everything but any touch of nature; he was not\\nlike youth, he was not like age, he was not like anything in the\\nworld but a model of deportment.\\n\\n\"Father! A visitor. Miss Jellyby\\'s friend, Miss Summerson.\"\\n\\n\"Distinguished,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"by Miss Summerson\\'s presence.\"\\nAs he bowed to me in that tight state, I almost believe I saw creases\\ncome into the whites of his eyes.\\n\\n\"My father,\" said the son, aside, to me with quite an affecting\\nbelief in him, \"is a celebrated character. My father is greatly\\nadmired.\"\\n\\n\"Go on, Prince! Go on!\" said Mr. Turveydrop, standing with his back\\nto the fire and waving his gloves condescendingly. \"Go on, my son!\"\\n\\nAt this command, or by this gracious permission, the lesson went on.\\nPrince Turveydrop sometimes played the kit, dancing; sometimes played\\nthe piano, standing; sometimes hummed the tune with what little\\nbreath he could spare, while he set a pupil right; always\\nconscientiously moved with the least proficient through every step\\nand every part of the figure; and never rested for an instant. His\\ndistinguished father did nothing whatever but stand before the fire,\\na model of deportment.\\n\\n\"And he never does anything else,\" said the old lady of the\\ncensorious countenance. \"Yet would you believe that it\\'s HIS name on\\nthe door-plate?\"\\n\\n\"His son\\'s name is the same, you know,\" said I.\\n\\n\"He wouldn\\'t let his son have any name if he could take it from him,\"\\nreturned the old lady. \"Look at the son\\'s dress!\" It certainly was\\nplain--threadbare--almost shabby. \"Yet the father must be garnished\\nand tricked out,\" said the old lady, \"because of his deportment. I\\'d\\ndeport him! Transport him would be better!\"\\n\\nI felt curious to know more concerning this person. I asked, \"Does he\\ngive lessons in deportment now?\"\\n\\n\"Now!\" returned the old lady shortly. \"Never did.\"\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s consideration, I suggested that perhaps fencing had\\nbeen his accomplishment.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe he can fence at all, ma\\'am,\" said the old lady.\\n\\nI looked surprised and inquisitive. The old lady, becoming more and\\nmore incensed against the master of deportment as she dwelt upon the\\nsubject, gave me some particulars of his career, with strong\\nassurances that they were mildly stated.\\n\\nHe had married a meek little dancing-mistress, with a tolerable\\nconnexion (having never in his life before done anything but deport\\nhimself), and had worked her to death, or had, at the best, suffered\\nher to work herself to death, to maintain him in those expenses which\\nwere indispensable to his position. At once to exhibit his deportment\\nto the best models and to keep the best models constantly before\\nhimself, he had found it necessary to frequent all public places of\\nfashionable and lounging resort, to be seen at Brighton and elsewhere\\nat fashionable times, and to lead an idle life in the very best\\nclothes. To enable him to do this, the affectionate little\\ndancing-mistress had toiled and laboured and would have toiled and\\nlaboured to that hour if her strength had lasted so long. For the\\nmainspring of the story was that in spite of the man\\'s absorbing\\nselfishness, his wife (overpowered by his deportment) had, to the\\nlast, believed in him and had, on her death-bed, in the most moving\\nterms, confided him to their son as one who had an inextinguishable\\nclaim upon him and whom he could never regard with too much pride and\\ndeference. The son, inheriting his mother\\'s belief, and having the\\ndeportment always before him, had lived and grown in the same faith,\\nand now, at thirty years of age, worked for his father twelve hours a\\nday and looked up to him with veneration on the old imaginary\\npinnacle.\\n\\n\"The airs the fellow gives himself!\" said my informant, shaking her\\nhead at old Mr. Turveydrop with speechless indignation as he drew on\\nhis tight gloves, of course unconscious of the homage she was\\nrendering. \"He fully believes he is one of the aristocracy! And he is\\nso condescending to the son he so egregiously deludes that you might\\nsuppose him the most virtuous of parents. Oh!\" said the old lady,\\napostrophizing him with infinite vehemence. \"I could bite you!\"\\n\\nI could not help being amused, though I heard the old lady out with\\nfeelings of real concern. It was difficult to doubt her with the\\nfather and son before me. What I might have thought of them without\\nthe old lady\\'s account, or what I might have thought of the old\\nlady\\'s account without them, I cannot say. There was a fitness of\\nthings in the whole that carried conviction with it.\\n\\nMy eyes were yet wandering, from young Mr. Turveydrop working so\\nhard, to old Mr. Turveydrop deporting himself so beautifully, when\\nthe latter came ambling up to me and entered into conversation.\\n\\nHe asked me, first of all, whether I conferred a charm and a\\ndistinction on London by residing in it? I did not think it necessary\\nto reply that I was perfectly aware I should not do that, in any\\ncase, but merely told him where I did reside.\\n\\n\"A lady so graceful and accomplished,\" he said, kissing his\\nright glove and afterwards extending it towards the pupils,\\n\"will look leniently on the deficiencies here. We do our best to\\npolish--polish--polish!\"\\n\\nHe sat down beside me, taking some pains to sit on the form, I\\nthought, in imitation of the print of his illustrious model on the\\nsofa. And really he did look very like it.\\n\\n\"To polish--polish--polish!\" he repeated, taking a pinch of snuff and\\ngently fluttering his fingers. \"But we are not, if I may say so to\\none formed to be graceful both by Nature and Art--\" with the\\nhigh-shouldered bow, which it seemed impossible for him to make\\nwithout lifting up his eyebrows and shutting his eyes \"--we are not\\nwhat we used to be in point of deportment.\"\\n\\n\"Are we not, sir?\" said I.\\n\\n\"We have degenerated,\" he returned, shaking his head, which he could\\ndo to a very limited extent in his cravat. \"A levelling age is not\\nfavourable to deportment. It develops vulgarity. Perhaps I speak with\\nsome little partiality. It may not be for me to say that I have been\\ncalled, for some years now, Gentleman Turveydrop, or that his Royal\\nHighness the Prince Regent did me the honour to inquire, on my\\nremoving my hat as he drove out of the Pavilion at Brighton (that\\nfine building), \\'Who is he? Who the devil is he? Why don\\'t I know\\nhim? Why hasn\\'t he thirty thousand a year?\\' But these are little\\nmatters of anecdote--the general property, ma\\'am--still repeated\\noccasionally among the upper classes.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed?\" said I.\\n\\nHe replied with the high-shouldered bow. \"Where what is left among us\\nof deportment,\" he added, \"still lingers. England--alas, my\\ncountry!--has degenerated very much, and is degenerating every day.\\nShe has not many gentlemen left. We are few. I see nothing to succeed\\nus but a race of weavers.\"\\n\\n\"One might hope that the race of gentlemen would be perpetuated\\nhere,\" said I.\\n\\n\"You are very good.\" He smiled with a high-shouldered bow again. \"You\\nflatter me. But, no--no! I have never been able to imbue my poor boy\\nwith that part of his art. Heaven forbid that I should disparage my\\ndear child, but he has--no deportment.\"\\n\\n\"He appears to be an excellent master,\" I observed.\\n\\n\"Understand me, my dear madam, he IS an excellent master. All that\\ncan be acquired, he has acquired. All that can be imparted, he can\\nimpart. But there ARE things--\" He took another pinch of snuff and\\nmade the bow again, as if to add, \"This kind of thing, for instance.\"\\n\\nI glanced towards the centre of the room, where Miss Jellyby\\'s lover,\\nnow engaged with single pupils, was undergoing greater drudgery than\\never.\\n\\n\"My amiable child,\" murmured Mr. Turveydrop, adjusting his cravat.\\n\\n\"Your son is indefatigable,\" said I.\\n\\n\"It is my reward,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"to hear you say so. In some\\nrespects, he treads in the footsteps of his sainted mother. She was a\\ndevoted creature. But wooman, lovely wooman,\" said Mr. Turveydrop\\nwith very disagreeable gallantry, \"what a sex you are!\"\\n\\nI rose and joined Miss Jellyby, who was by this time putting on her\\nbonnet. The time allotted to a lesson having fully elapsed, there was\\na general putting on of bonnets. When Miss Jellyby and the\\nunfortunate Prince found an opportunity to become betrothed I don\\'t\\nknow, but they certainly found none on this occasion to exchange a\\ndozen words.\\n\\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Turveydrop benignly to his son, \"do you know the\\nhour?\"\\n\\n\"No, father.\" The son had no watch. The father had a handsome gold\\none, which he pulled out with an air that was an example to mankind.\\n\\n\"My son,\" said he, \"it\\'s two o\\'clock. Recollect your school at\\nKensington at three.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s time enough for me, father,\" said Prince. \"I can take a\\nmorsel of dinner standing and be off.\"\\n\\n\"My dear boy,\" returned his father, \"you must be very quick. You will\\nfind the cold mutton on the table.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, father. Are YOU off now, father?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear. I suppose,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, shutting his eyes and\\nlifting up his shoulders with modest consciousness, \"that I must show\\nmyself, as usual, about town.\"\\n\\n\"You had better dine out comfortably somewhere,\" said his son.\\n\\n\"My dear child, I intend to. I shall take my little meal, I think, at\\nthe French house, in the Opera Colonnade.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right. Good-bye, father!\" said Prince, shaking hands.\\n\\n\"Good-bye, my son. Bless you!\"\\n\\nMr. Turveydrop said this in quite a pious manner, and it seemed to do\\nhis son good, who, in parting from him, was so pleased with him, so\\ndutiful to him, and so proud of him that I almost felt as if it were\\nan unkindness to the younger man not to be able to believe implicitly\\nin the elder. The few moments that were occupied by Prince in taking\\nleave of us (and particularly of one of us, as I saw, being in the\\nsecret), enhanced my favourable impression of his almost childish\\ncharacter. I felt a liking for him and a compassion for him as he put\\nhis little kit in his pocket--and with it his desire to stay a little\\nwhile with Caddy--and went away good-humouredly to his cold mutton\\nand his school at Kensington, that made me scarcely less irate with\\nhis father than the censorious old lady.\\n\\nThe father opened the room door for us and bowed us out in a manner,\\nI must acknowledge, worthy of his shining original. In the same style\\nhe presently passed us on the other side of the street, on his way to\\nthe aristocratic part of the town, where he was going to show himself\\namong the few other gentlemen left. For some moments, I was so lost\\nin reconsidering what I had heard and seen in Newman Street that I\\nwas quite unable to talk to Caddy or even to fix my attention on what\\nshe said to me, especially when I began to inquire in my mind whether\\nthere were, or ever had been, any other gentlemen, not in the dancing\\nprofession, who lived and founded a reputation entirely on their\\ndeportment. This became so bewildering and suggested the possibility\\nof so many Mr. Turveydrops that I said, \"Esther, you must make up\\nyour mind to abandon this subject altogether and attend to Caddy.\" I\\naccordingly did so, and we chatted all the rest of the way to\\nLincoln\\'s Inn.\\n\\nCaddy told me that her lover\\'s education had been so neglected that\\nit was not always easy to read his notes. She said if he were not so\\nanxious about his spelling and took less pains to make it clear, he\\nwould do better; but he put so many unnecessary letters into short\\nwords that they sometimes quite lost their English appearance. \"He\\ndoes it with the best intention,\" observed Caddy, \"but it hasn\\'t the\\neffect he means, poor fellow!\" Caddy then went on to reason, how\\ncould he be expected to be a scholar when he had passed his whole\\nlife in the dancing-school and had done nothing but teach and fag,\\nfag and teach, morning, noon, and night! And what did it matter? She\\ncould write letters enough for both, as she knew to her cost, and it\\nwas far better for him to be amiable than learned. \"Besides, it\\'s not\\nas if I was an accomplished girl who had any right to give herself\\nairs,\" said Caddy. \"I know little enough, I am sure, thanks to Ma!\\n\\n\"There\\'s another thing I want to tell you, now we are alone,\"\\ncontinued Caddy, \"which I should not have liked to mention unless you\\nhad seen Prince, Miss Summerson. You know what a house ours is. It\\'s\\nof no use my trying to learn anything that it would be useful for\\nPrince\\'s wife to know in OUR house. We live in such a state of muddle\\nthat it\\'s impossible, and I have only been more disheartened whenever\\nI have tried. So I get a little practice with--who do you think? Poor\\nMiss Flite! Early in the morning I help her to tidy her room and\\nclean her birds, and I make her cup of coffee for her (of course she\\ntaught me), and I have learnt to make it so well that Prince says\\nit\\'s the very best coffee he ever tasted, and would quite delight old\\nMr. Turveydrop, who is very particular indeed about his coffee. I can\\nmake little puddings too; and I know how to buy neck of mutton, and\\ntea, and sugar, and butter, and a good many housekeeping things. I am\\nnot clever at my needle, yet,\" said Caddy, glancing at the repairs on\\nPeepy\\'s frock, \"but perhaps I shall improve, and since I have been\\nengaged to Prince and have been doing all this, I have felt\\nbetter-tempered, I hope, and more forgiving to Ma. It rather put me\\nout at first this morning to see you and Miss Clare looking so neat\\nand pretty and to feel ashamed of Peepy and myself too, but on the\\nwhole I hope I am better-tempered than I was and more forgiving to\\nMa.\"\\n\\nThe poor girl, trying so hard, said it from her heart, and touched\\nmine. \"Caddy, my love,\" I replied, \"I begin to have a great affection\\nfor you, and I hope we shall become friends.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, do you?\" cried Caddy. \"How happy that would make me!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Caddy,\" said I, \"let us be friends from this time, and let\\nus often have a chat about these matters and try to find the right\\nway through them.\" Caddy was overjoyed. I said everything I could in\\nmy old-fashioned way to comfort and encourage her, and I would not\\nhave objected to old Mr. Turveydrop that day for any smaller\\nconsideration than a settlement on his daughter-in-law.\\n\\nBy this time we were come to Mr. Krook\\'s, whose private door stood\\nopen. There was a bill, pasted on the door-post, announcing a room to\\nlet on the second floor. It reminded Caddy to tell me as we proceeded\\nupstairs that there had been a sudden death there and an inquest and\\nthat our little friend had been ill of the fright. The door and\\nwindow of the vacant room being open, we looked in. It was the room\\nwith the dark door to which Miss Flite had secretly directed my\\nattention when I was last in the house. A sad and desolate place it\\nwas, a gloomy, sorrowful place that gave me a strange sensation of\\nmournfulness and even dread. \"You look pale,\" said Caddy when we came\\nout, \"and cold!\" I felt as if the room had chilled me.\\n\\nWe had walked slowly while we were talking, and my guardian and Ada\\nwere here before us. We found them in Miss Flite\\'s garret. They were\\nlooking at the birds, while a medical gentleman who was so good as to\\nattend Miss Flite with much solicitude and compassion spoke with her\\ncheerfully by the fire.\\n\\n\"I have finished my professional visit,\" he said, coming forward.\\n\"Miss Flite is much better and may appear in court (as her mind is\\nset upon it) to-morrow. She has been greatly missed there, I\\nunderstand.\"\\n\\nMiss Flite received the compliment with complacency and dropped a\\ngeneral curtsy to us.\\n\\n\"Honoured, indeed,\" said she, \"by another visit from the wards in\\nJarndyce! Ve-ry happy to receive Jarndyce of Bleak House beneath my\\nhumble roof!\" with a special curtsy. \"Fitz-Jarndyce, my dear\"--she\\nhad bestowed that name on Caddy, it appeared, and always called her\\nby it--\"a double welcome!\"\\n\\n\"Has she been very ill?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce of the gentleman whom we\\nhad found in attendance on her. She answered for herself directly,\\nthough he had put the question in a whisper.\\n\\n\"Oh, decidedly unwell! Oh, very unwell indeed,\" she said\\nconfidentially. \"Not pain, you know--trouble. Not bodily so much as\\nnervous, nervous! The truth is,\" in a subdued voice and trembling,\\n\"we have had death here. There was poison in the house. I am very\\nsusceptible to such horrid things. It frightened me. Only Mr.\\nWoodcourt knows how much. My physician, Mr. Woodcourt!\" with\\ngreat stateliness. \"The wards in Jarndyce--Jarndyce of Bleak\\nHouse--Fitz-Jarndyce!\"\\n\\n\"Miss Flite,\" said Mr. Woodcourt in a grave kind of voice, as if he\\nwere appealing to her while speaking to us, and laying his hand\\ngently on her arm, \"Miss Flite describes her illness with her usual\\naccuracy. She was alarmed by an occurrence in the house which might\\nhave alarmed a stronger person, and was made ill by the distress and\\nagitation. She brought me here in the first hurry of the discovery,\\nthough too late for me to be of any use to the unfortunate man. I\\nhave compensated myself for that disappointment by coming here since\\nand being of some small use to her.\"\\n\\n\"The kindest physician in the college,\" whispered Miss Flite to me.\\n\"I expect a judgment. On the day of judgment. And shall then confer\\nestates.\"\\n\\n\"She will be as well in a day or two,\" said Mr. Woodcourt, looking at\\nher with an observant smile, \"as she ever will be. In other words,\\nquite well of course. Have you heard of her good fortune?\"\\n\\n\"Most extraordinary!\" said Miss Flite, smiling brightly. \"You never\\nheard of such a thing, my dear! Every Saturday, Conversation Kenge or\\nGuppy (clerk to Conversation K.) places in my hand a paper of\\nshillings. Shillings. I assure you! Always the same number in the\\npaper. Always one for every day in the week. Now you know, really! So\\nwell-timed, is it not? Ye-es! From whence do these papers come, you\\nsay? That is the great question. Naturally. Shall I tell you what I\\nthink? I think,\" said Miss Flite, drawing herself back with a very\\nshrewd look and shaking her right forefinger in a most significant\\nmanner, \"that the Lord Chancellor, aware of the length of time during\\nwhich the Great Seal has been open (for it has been open a long\\ntime!), forwards them. Until the judgment I expect is given. Now\\nthat\\'s very creditable, you know. To confess in that way that he IS a\\nlittle slow for human life. So delicate! Attending court the other\\nday--I attend it regularly, with my documents--I taxed him with it,\\nand he almost confessed. That is, I smiled at him from my bench, and\\nHE smiled at me from his bench. But it\\'s great good fortune, is it\\nnot? And Fitz-Jarndyce lays the money out for me to great advantage.\\nOh, I assure you to the greatest advantage!\"\\n\\nI congratulated her (as she addressed herself to me) upon this\\nfortunate addition to her income and wished her a long continuance of\\nit. I did not speculate upon the source from which it came or wonder\\nwhose humanity was so considerate. My guardian stood before me,\\ncontemplating the birds, and I had no need to look beyond him.\\n\\n\"And what do you call these little fellows, ma\\'am?\" said he in his\\npleasant voice. \"Have they any names?\"\\n\\n\"I can answer for Miss Flite that they have,\" said I, \"for she\\npromised to tell us what they were. Ada remembers?\"\\n\\nAda remembered very well.\\n\\n\"Did I?\" said Miss Flite. \"Who\\'s that at my door? What are you\\nlistening at my door for, Krook?\"\\n\\nThe old man of the house, pushing it open before him, appeared there\\nwith his fur cap in his hand and his cat at his heels.\\n\\n\"I warn\\'t listening, Miss Flite,\" he said, \"I was going to give a rap\\nwith my knuckles, only you\\'re so quick!\"\\n\\n\"Make your cat go down. Drive her away!\" the old lady angrily\\nexclaimed.\\n\\n\"Bah, bah! There ain\\'t no danger, gentlefolks,\" said Mr. Krook,\\nlooking slowly and sharply from one to another until he had looked at\\nall of us; \"she\\'d never offer at the birds when I was here unless I\\ntold her to it.\"\\n\\n\"You will excuse my landlord,\" said the old lady with a dignified\\nair. \"M, quite M! What do you want, Krook, when I have company?\"\\n\\n\"Hi!\" said the old man. \"You know I am the Chancellor.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\" returned Miss Flite. \"What of that?\"\\n\\n\"For the Chancellor,\" said the old man with a chuckle, \"not to be\\nacquainted with a Jarndyce is queer, ain\\'t it, Miss Flite? Mightn\\'t I\\ntake the liberty? Your servant, sir. I know Jarndyce and Jarndyce\\na\\'most as well as you do, sir. I knowed old Squire Tom, sir. I never\\nto my knowledge see you afore though, not even in court. Yet, I go\\nthere a mortal sight of times in the course of the year, taking one\\nday with another.\"\\n\\n\"I never go there,\" said Mr. Jarndyce (which he never did on any\\nconsideration). \"I would sooner go--somewhere else.\"\\n\\n\"Would you though?\" returned Krook, grinning. \"You\\'re bearing hard\\nupon my noble and learned brother in your meaning, sir, though\\nperhaps it is but nat\\'ral in a Jarndyce. The burnt child, sir! What,\\nyou\\'re looking at my lodger\\'s birds, Mr. Jarndyce?\" The old man had\\ncome by little and little into the room until he now touched my\\nguardian with his elbow and looked close up into his face with his\\nspectacled eyes. \"It\\'s one of her strange ways that she\\'ll never tell\\nthe names of these birds if she can help it, though she named \\'em\\nall.\" This was in a whisper. \"Shall I run \\'em over, Flite?\" he asked\\naloud, winking at us and pointing at her as she turned away,\\naffecting to sweep the grate.\\n\\n\"If you like,\" she answered hurriedly.\\n\\nThe old man, looking up at the cages after another look at us, went\\nthrough the list.\\n\\n\"Hope, Joy, Youth, Peace, Rest, Life, Dust, Ashes, Waste, Want, Ruin,\\nDespair, Madness, Death, Cunning, Folly, Words, Wigs, Rags,\\nSheepskin, Plunder, Precedent, Jargon, Gammon, and Spinach. That\\'s\\nthe whole collection,\" said the old man, \"all cooped up together, by\\nmy noble and learned brother.\"\\n\\n\"This is a bitter wind!\" muttered my guardian.\\n\\n\"When my noble and learned brother gives his judgment, they\\'re to be\\nlet go free,\" said Krook, winking at us again. \"And then,\" he added,\\nwhispering and grinning, \"if that ever was to happen--which it\\nwon\\'t--the birds that have never been caged would kill \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"If ever the wind was in the east,\" said my guardian, pretending to\\nlook out of the window for a weathercock, \"I think it\\'s there\\nto-day!\"\\n\\nWe found it very difficult to get away from the house. It was not\\nMiss Flite who detained us; she was as reasonable a little creature\\nin consulting the convenience of others as there possibly could be.\\nIt was Mr. Krook. He seemed unable to detach himself from Mr.\\nJarndyce. If he had been linked to him, he could hardly have attended\\nhim more closely. He proposed to show us his Court of Chancery and\\nall the strange medley it contained; during the whole of our\\ninspection (prolonged by himself) he kept close to Mr. Jarndyce and\\nsometimes detained him under one pretence or other until we had\\npassed on, as if he were tormented by an inclination to enter upon\\nsome secret subject which he could not make up his mind to approach.\\nI cannot imagine a countenance and manner more singularly expressive\\nof caution and indecision, and a perpetual impulse to do something he\\ncould not resolve to venture on, than Mr. Krook\\'s was that day. His\\nwatchfulness of my guardian was incessant. He rarely removed his eyes\\nfrom his face. If he went on beside him, he observed him with the\\nslyness of an old white fox. If he went before, he looked back. When\\nwe stood still, he got opposite to him, and drawing his hand across\\nand across his open mouth with a curious expression of a sense of\\npower, and turning up his eyes, and lowering his grey eyebrows until\\nthey appeared to be shut, seemed to scan every lineament of his face.\\n\\nAt last, having been (always attended by the cat) all over the house\\nand having seen the whole stock of miscellaneous lumber, which was\\ncertainly curious, we came into the back part of the shop. Here on\\nthe head of an empty barrel stood on end were an ink-bottle, some old\\nstumps of pens, and some dirty playbills; and against the wall were\\npasted several large printed alphabets in several plain hands.\\n\\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked my guardian.\\n\\n\"Trying to learn myself to read and write,\" said Krook.\\n\\n\"And how do you get on?\"\\n\\n\"Slow. Bad,\" returned the old man impatiently. \"It\\'s hard at my time\\nof life.\"\\n\\n\"It would be easier to be taught by some one,\" said my guardian.\\n\\n\"Aye, but they might teach me wrong!\" returned the old man with a\\nwonderfully suspicious flash of his eye. \"I don\\'t know what I may\\nhave lost by not being learned afore. I wouldn\\'t like to lose\\nanything by being learned wrong now.\"\\n\\n\"Wrong?\" said my guardian with his good-humoured smile. \"Who do you\\nsuppose would teach you wrong?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House!\" replied the old man,\\nturning up his spectacles on his forehead and rubbing his hands. \"I\\ndon\\'t suppose as anybody would, but I\\'d rather trust my own self than\\nanother!\"\\n\\nThese answers and his manner were strange enough to cause my guardian\\nto inquire of Mr. Woodcourt, as we all walked across Lincoln\\'s Inn\\ntogether, whether Mr. Krook were really, as his lodger represented\\nhim, deranged. The young surgeon replied, no, he had seen no reason\\nto think so. He was exceedingly distrustful, as ignorance usually\\nwas, and he was always more or less under the influence of raw gin,\\nof which he drank great quantities and of which he and his back-shop,\\nas we might have observed, smelt strongly; but he did not think him\\nmad as yet.\\n\\nOn our way home, I so conciliated Peepy\\'s affections by buying him a\\nwindmill and two flour-sacks that he would suffer nobody else to take\\noff his hat and gloves and would sit nowhere at dinner but at my\\nside. Caddy sat upon the other side of me, next to Ada, to whom we\\nimparted the whole history of the engagement as soon as we got back.\\nWe made much of Caddy, and Peepy too; and Caddy brightened\\nexceedingly; and my guardian was as merry as we were; and we were all\\nvery happy indeed until Caddy went home at night in a hackney-coach,\\nwith Peepy fast asleep, but holding tight to the windmill.\\n\\nI have forgotten to mention--at least I have not mentioned--that Mr.\\nWoodcourt was the same dark young surgeon whom we had met at Mr.\\nBadger\\'s. Or that Mr. Jarndyce invited him to dinner that day. Or\\nthat he came. Or that when they were all gone and I said to Ada,\\n\"Now, my darling, let us have a little talk about Richard!\" Ada\\nlaughed and said--\\n\\nBut I don\\'t think it matters what my darling said. She was always\\nmerry.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile we were in London Mr. Jarndyce was constantly beset by the\\ncrowd of excitable ladies and gentlemen whose proceedings had so much\\nastonished us. Mr. Quale, who presented himself soon after our\\narrival, was in all such excitements. He seemed to project those two\\nshining knobs of temples of his into everything that went on and to\\nbrush his hair farther and farther back, until the very roots were\\nalmost ready to fly out of his head in inappeasable philanthropy. All\\nobjects were alike to him, but he was always particularly ready for\\nanything in the way of a testimonial to any one. His great power\\nseemed to be his power of indiscriminate admiration. He would sit for\\nany length of time, with the utmost enjoyment, bathing his temples in\\nthe light of any order of luminary. Having first seen him perfectly\\nswallowed up in admiration of Mrs. Jellyby, I had supposed her to be\\nthe absorbing object of his devotion. I soon discovered my mistake\\nand found him to be train-bearer and organ-blower to a whole\\nprocession of people.\\n\\nMrs. Pardiggle came one day for a subscription to something, and with\\nher, Mr. Quale. Whatever Mrs. Pardiggle said, Mr. Quale repeated to\\nus; and just as he had drawn Mrs. Jellyby out, he drew Mrs. Pardiggle\\nout. Mrs. Pardiggle wrote a letter of introduction to my guardian in\\nbehalf of her eloquent friend Mr. Gusher. With Mr. Gusher appeared\\nMr. Quale again. Mr. Gusher, being a flabby gentleman with a moist\\nsurface and eyes so much too small for his moon of a face that they\\nseemed to have been originally made for somebody else, was not at\\nfirst sight prepossessing; yet he was scarcely seated before Mr.\\nQuale asked Ada and me, not inaudibly, whether he was not a great\\ncreature--which he certainly was, flabbily speaking, though Mr. Quale\\nmeant in intellectual beauty--and whether we were not struck by his\\nmassive configuration of brow. In short, we heard of a great many\\nmissions of various sorts among this set of people, but nothing\\nrespecting them was half so clear to us as that it was Mr. Quale\\'s\\nmission to be in ecstasies with everybody else\\'s mission and that it\\nwas the most popular mission of all.\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce had fallen into this company in the tenderness of his\\nheart and his earnest desire to do all the good in his power; but\\nthat he felt it to be too often an unsatisfactory company, where\\nbenevolence took spasmodic forms, where charity was assumed as a\\nregular uniform by loud professors and speculators in cheap\\nnotoriety, vehement in profession, restless and vain in action,\\nservile in the last degree of meanness to the great, adulatory of one\\nanother, and intolerable to those who were anxious quietly to help\\nthe weak from failing rather than with a great deal of bluster and\\nself-laudation to raise them up a little way when they were down, he\\nplainly told us. When a testimonial was originated to Mr. Quale by\\nMr. Gusher (who had already got one, originated by Mr. Quale), and\\nwhen Mr. Gusher spoke for an hour and a half on the subject to a\\nmeeting, including two charity schools of small boys and girls, who\\nwere specially reminded of the widow\\'s mite, and requested to come\\nforward with halfpence and be acceptable sacrifices, I think the wind\\nwas in the east for three whole weeks.\\n\\nI mention this because I am coming to Mr. Skimpole again. It seemed\\nto me that his off-hand professions of childishness and carelessness\\nwere a great relief to my guardian, by contrast with such things, and\\nwere the more readily believed in since to find one perfectly\\nundesigning and candid man among many opposites could not fail to\\ngive him pleasure. I should be sorry to imply that Mr. Skimpole\\ndivined this and was politic; I really never understood him well\\nenough to know. What he was to my guardian, he certainly was to the\\nrest of the world.\\n\\nHe had not been very well; and thus, though he lived in London, we\\nhad seen nothing of him until now. He appeared one morning in his\\nusual agreeable way and as full of pleasant spirits as ever.\\n\\nWell, he said, here he was! He had been bilious, but rich men were\\noften bilious, and therefore he had been persuading himself that he\\nwas a man of property. So he was, in a certain point of view--in his\\nexpansive intentions. He had been enriching his medical attendant in\\nthe most lavish manner. He had always doubled, and sometimes\\nquadrupled, his fees. He had said to the doctor, \"Now, my dear\\ndoctor, it is quite a delusion on your part to suppose that you\\nattend me for nothing. I am overwhelming you with money--in my\\nexpansive intentions--if you only knew it!\" And really (he said) he\\nmeant it to that degree that he thought it much the same as doing it.\\nIf he had had those bits of metal or thin paper to which mankind\\nattached so much importance to put in the doctor\\'s hand, he would\\nhave put them in the doctor\\'s hand. Not having them, he substituted\\nthe will for the deed. Very well! If he really meant it--if his will\\nwere genuine and real, which it was--it appeared to him that it was\\nthe same as coin, and cancelled the obligation.\\n\\n\"It may be, partly, because I know nothing of the value of money,\"\\nsaid Mr. Skimpole, \"but I often feel this. It seems so reasonable! My\\nbutcher says to me he wants that little bill. It\\'s a part of the\\npleasant unconscious poetry of the man\\'s nature that he always calls\\nit a \\'little\\' bill--to make the payment appear easy to both of us. I\\nreply to the butcher, \\'My good friend, if you knew it, you are paid.\\nYou haven\\'t had the trouble of coming to ask for the little bill. You\\nare paid. I mean it.\\'\"\\n\\n\"But, suppose,\" said my guardian, laughing, \"he had meant the meat in\\nthe bill, instead of providing it?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Jarndyce,\" he returned, \"you surprise me. You take the\\nbutcher\\'s position. A butcher I once dealt with occupied that very\\nground. Says he, \\'Sir, why did you eat spring lamb at eighteen pence\\na pound?\\' \\'Why did I eat spring lamb at eighteen pence a pound, my\\nhonest friend?\\' said I, naturally amazed by the question. \\'I like\\nspring lamb!\\' This was so far convincing. \\'Well, sir,\\' says he, \\'I\\nwish I had meant the lamb as you mean the money!\\' \\'My good fellow,\\'\\nsaid I, \\'pray let us reason like intellectual beings. How could that\\nbe? It was impossible. You HAD got the lamb, and I have NOT got the\\nmoney. You couldn\\'t really mean the lamb without sending it in,\\nwhereas I can, and do, really mean the money without paying it!\\' He\\nhad not a word. There was an end of the subject.\"\\n\\n\"Did he take no legal proceedings?\" inquired my guardian.\\n\\n\"Yes, he took legal proceedings,\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"But in that he\\nwas influenced by passion, not by reason. Passion reminds me of\\nBoythorn. He writes me that you and the ladies have promised him a\\nshort visit at his bachelor-house in Lincolnshire.\"\\n\\n\"He is a great favourite with my girls,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"and I\\nhave promised for them.\"\\n\\n\"Nature forgot to shade him off, I think,\" observed Mr. Skimpole to\\nAda and me. \"A little too boisterous--like the sea. A little too\\nvehement--like a bull who has made up his mind to consider every\\ncolour scarlet. But I grant a sledge-hammering sort of merit in him!\"\\n\\nI should have been surprised if those two could have thought very\\nhighly of one another, Mr. Boythorn attaching so much importance to\\nmany things and Mr. Skimpole caring so little for anything. Besides\\nwhich, I had noticed Mr. Boythorn more than once on the point of\\nbreaking out into some strong opinion when Mr. Skimpole was referred\\nto. Of course I merely joined Ada in saying that we had been greatly\\npleased with him.\\n\\n\"He has invited me,\" said Mr. Skimpole; \"and if a child may trust\\nhimself in such hands--which the present child is encouraged to do,\\nwith the united tenderness of two angels to guard him--I shall go. He\\nproposes to frank me down and back again. I suppose it will cost\\nmoney? Shillings perhaps? Or pounds? Or something of that sort? By\\nthe by, Coavinses. You remember our friend Coavinses, Miss\\nSummerson?\"\\n\\nHe asked me as the subject arose in his mind, in his graceful,\\nlight-hearted manner and without the least embarrassment.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" said I.\\n\\n\"Coavinses has been arrested by the Great Bailiff,\" said Mr.\\nSkimpole. \"He will never do violence to the sunshine any more.\"\\n\\nIt quite shocked me to hear it, for I had already recalled with\\nanything but a serious association the image of the man sitting on\\nthe sofa that night wiping his head.\\n\\n\"His successor informed me of it yesterday,\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"His\\nsuccessor is in my house now--in possession, I think he calls it. He\\ncame yesterday, on my blue-eyed daughter\\'s birthday. I put it to him,\\n\\'This is unreasonable and inconvenient. If you had a blue-eyed\\ndaughter you wouldn\\'t like ME to come, uninvited, on HER birthday?\\'\\nBut he stayed.\"\\n\\nMr. Skimpole laughed at the pleasant absurdity and lightly touched\\nthe piano by which he was seated.\\n\\n\"And he told me,\" he said, playing little chords where I shall put\\nfull stops, \"The Coavinses had left. Three children. No mother. And\\nthat Coavinses\\' profession. Being unpopular. The rising Coavinses.\\nWere at a considerable disadvantage.\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce got up, rubbing his head, and began to walk about. Mr.\\nSkimpole played the melody of one of Ada\\'s favourite songs. Ada and I\\nboth looked at Mr. Jarndyce, thinking that we knew what was passing\\nin his mind.\\n\\nAfter walking and stopping, and several times leaving off rubbing his\\nhead, and beginning again, my guardian put his hand upon the keys and\\nstopped Mr. Skimpole\\'s playing. \"I don\\'t like this, Skimpole,\" he\\nsaid thoughtfully.\\n\\nMr. Skimpole, who had quite forgotten the subject, looked up\\nsurprised.\\n\\n\"The man was necessary,\" pursued my guardian, walking backward and\\nforward in the very short space between the piano and the end of the\\nroom and rubbing his hair up from the back of his head as if a high\\neast wind had blown it into that form. \"If we make such men necessary\\nby our faults and follies, or by our want of worldly knowledge, or by\\nour misfortunes, we must not revenge ourselves upon them. There was\\nno harm in his trade. He maintained his children. One would like to\\nknow more about this.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Coavinses?\" cried Mr. Skimpole, at length perceiving what he\\nmeant. \"Nothing easier. A walk to Coavinses\\' headquarters, and you\\ncan know what you will.\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce nodded to us, who were only waiting for the signal.\\n\"Come! We will walk that way, my dears. Why not that way as soon as\\nanother!\" We were quickly ready and went out. Mr. Skimpole went with\\nus and quite enjoyed the expedition. It was so new and so refreshing,\\nhe said, for him to want Coavinses instead of Coavinses wanting him!\\n\\nHe took us, first, to Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane, where there was\\na house with barred windows, which he called Coavinses\\' Castle. On\\nour going into the entry and ringing a bell, a very hideous boy came\\nout of a sort of office and looked at us over a spiked wicket.\\n\\n\"Who did you want?\" said the boy, fitting two of the spikes into his\\nchin.\\n\\n\"There was a follower, or an officer, or something, here,\" said Mr.\\nJarndyce, \"who is dead.\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\" said the boy. \"Well?\"\\n\\n\"I want to know his name, if you please?\"\\n\\n\"Name of Neckett,\" said the boy.\\n\\n\"And his address?\"\\n\\n\"Bell Yard,\" said the boy. \"Chandler\\'s shop, left hand side, name of\\nBlinder.\"\\n\\n\"Was he--I don\\'t know how to shape the question--\" murmured my\\nguardian, \"industrious?\"\\n\\n\"Was Neckett?\" said the boy. \"Yes, wery much so. He was never tired\\nof watching. He\\'d set upon a post at a street corner eight or ten\\nhours at a stretch if he undertook to do it.\"\\n\\n\"He might have done worse,\" I heard my guardian soliloquize. \"He\\nmight have undertaken to do it and not done it. Thank you. That\\'s all\\nI want.\"\\n\\nWe left the boy, with his head on one side and his arms on the gate,\\nfondling and sucking the spikes, and went back to Lincoln\\'s Inn,\\nwhere Mr. Skimpole, who had not cared to remain nearer Coavinses,\\nawaited us. Then we all went to Bell Yard, a narrow alley at a very\\nshort distance. We soon found the chandler\\'s shop. In it was a\\ngood-natured-looking old woman with a dropsy, or an asthma, or\\nperhaps both.\\n\\n\"Neckett\\'s children?\" said she in reply to my inquiry. \"Yes, Surely,\\nmiss. Three pair, if you please. Door right opposite the stairs.\" And\\nshe handed me the key across the counter.\\n\\nI glanced at the key and glanced at her, but she took it for granted\\nthat I knew what to do with it. As it could only be intended for the\\nchildren\\'s door, I came out without asking any more questions and led\\nthe way up the dark stairs. We went as quietly as we could, but four\\nof us made some noise on the aged boards, and when we came to the\\nsecond story we found we had disturbed a man who was standing there\\nlooking out of his room.\\n\\n\"Is it Gridley that\\'s wanted?\" he said, fixing his eyes on me with an\\nangry stare.\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" said I; \"I am going higher up.\"\\n\\nHe looked at Ada, and at Mr. Jarndyce, and at Mr. Skimpole, fixing\\nthe same angry stare on each in succession as they passed and\\nfollowed me. Mr. Jarndyce gave him good day. \"Good day!\" he said\\nabruptly and fiercely. He was a tall, sallow man with a careworn head\\non which but little hair remained, a deeply lined face, and prominent\\neyes. He had a combative look and a chafing, irritable manner which,\\nassociated with his figure--still large and powerful, though\\nevidently in its decline--rather alarmed me. He had a pen in his\\nhand, and in the glimpse I caught of his room in passing, I saw that\\nit was covered with a litter of papers.\\n\\nLeaving him standing there, we went up to the top room. I tapped at\\nthe door, and a little shrill voice inside said, \"We are locked in.\\nMrs. Blinder\\'s got the key!\"\\n\\nI applied the key on hearing this and opened the door. In a poor room\\nwith a sloping ceiling and containing very little furniture was a\\nmite of a boy, some five or six years old, nursing and hushing a\\nheavy child of eighteen months. There was no fire, though the weather\\nwas cold; both children were wrapped in some poor shawls and tippets\\nas a substitute. Their clothing was not so warm, however, but that\\ntheir noses looked red and pinched and their small figures shrunken\\nas the boy walked up and down nursing and hushing the child with its\\nhead on his shoulder.\\n\\n\"Who has locked you up here alone?\" we naturally asked.\\n\\n\"Charley,\" said the boy, standing still to gaze at us.\\n\\n\"Is Charley your brother?\"\\n\\n\"No. She\\'s my sister, Charlotte. Father called her Charley.\"\\n\\n\"Are there any more of you besides Charley?\"\\n\\n\"Me,\" said the boy, \"and Emma,\" patting the limp bonnet of the child\\nhe was nursing. \"And Charley.\"\\n\\n\"Where is Charley now?\"\\n\\n\"Out a-washing,\" said the boy, beginning to walk up and down again\\nand taking the nankeen bonnet much too near the bedstead by trying to\\ngaze at us at the same time.\\n\\nWe were looking at one another and at these two children when there\\ncame into the room a very little girl, childish in figure but shrewd\\nand older-looking in the face--pretty-faced too--wearing a womanly\\nsort of bonnet much too large for her and drying her bare arms on a\\nwomanly sort of apron. Her fingers were white and wrinkled with\\nwashing, and the soap-suds were yet smoking which she wiped off her\\narms. But for this, she might have been a child playing at washing\\nand imitating a poor working-woman with a quick observation of the\\ntruth.\\n\\nShe had come running from some place in the neighbourhood and had\\nmade all the haste she could. Consequently, though she was very\\nlight, she was out of breath and could not speak at first, as she\\nstood panting, and wiping her arms, and looking quietly at us.\\n\\n\"Oh, here\\'s Charley!\" said the boy.\\n\\nThe child he was nursing stretched forth its arms and cried out to be\\ntaken by Charley. The little girl took it, in a womanly sort of\\nmanner belonging to the apron and the bonnet, and stood looking at us\\nover the burden that clung to her most affectionately.\\n\\n\"Is it possible,\" whispered my guardian as we put a chair for the\\nlittle creature and got her to sit down with her load, the boy\\nkeeping close to her, holding to her apron, \"that this child works\\nfor the rest? Look at this! For God\\'s sake, look at this!\"\\n\\nIt was a thing to look at. The three children close together, and two\\nof them relying solely on the third, and the third so young and yet\\nwith an air of age and steadiness that sat so strangely on the\\nchildish figure.\\n\\n\"Charley, Charley!\" said my guardian. \"How old are you?\"\\n\\n\"Over thirteen, sir,\" replied the child.\\n\\n\"Oh! What a great age,\" said my guardian. \"What a great age,\\nCharley!\"\\n\\nI cannot describe the tenderness with which he spoke to her, half\\nplayfully yet all the more compassionately and mournfully.\\n\\n\"And do you live alone here with these babies, Charley?\" said my\\nguardian.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" returned the child, looking up into his face with perfect\\nconfidence, \"since father died.\"\\n\\n\"And how do you live, Charley? Oh! Charley,\" said my guardian,\\nturning his face away for a moment, \"how do you live?\"\\n\\n\"Since father died, sir, I\\'ve gone out to work. I\\'m out washing\\nto-day.\"\\n\\n\"God help you, Charley!\" said my guardian. \"You\\'re not tall enough to\\nreach the tub!\"\\n\\n\"In pattens I am, sir,\" she said quickly. \"I\\'ve got a high pair as\\nbelonged to mother.\"\\n\\n\"And when did mother die? Poor mother!\"\\n\\n\"Mother died just after Emma was born,\" said the child, glancing at\\nthe face upon her bosom. \"Then father said I was to be as good a\\nmother to her as I could. And so I tried. And so I worked at home and\\ndid cleaning and nursing and washing for a long time before I began\\nto go out. And that\\'s how I know how; don\\'t you see, sir?\"\\n\\n\"And do you often go out?\"\\n\\n\"As often as I can,\" said Charley, opening her eyes and smiling,\\n\"because of earning sixpences and shillings!\"\\n\\n\"And do you always lock the babies up when you go out?\"\\n\\n\"To keep \\'em safe, sir, don\\'t you see?\" said Charley. \"Mrs. Blinder\\ncomes up now and then, and Mr. Gridley comes up sometimes, and\\nperhaps I can run in sometimes, and they can play you know, and Tom\\nan\\'t afraid of being locked up, are you, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"No-o!\" said Tom stoutly.\\n\\n\"When it comes on dark, the lamps are lighted down in the court, and\\nthey show up here quite bright--almost quite bright. Don\\'t they,\\nTom?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Charley,\" said Tom, \"almost quite bright.\"\\n\\n\"Then he\\'s as good as gold,\" said the little creature--Oh, in such a\\nmotherly, womanly way! \"And when Emma\\'s tired, he puts her to bed.\\nAnd when he\\'s tired he goes to bed himself. And when I come home and\\nlight the candle and has a bit of supper, he sits up again and has it\\nwith me. Don\\'t you, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, Charley!\" said Tom. \"That I do!\" And either in this glimpse\\nof the great pleasure of his life or in gratitude and love for\\nCharley, who was all in all to him, he laid his face among the scanty\\nfolds of her frock and passed from laughing into crying.\\n\\nIt was the first time since our entry that a tear had been shed among\\nthese children. The little orphan girl had spoken of their father and\\ntheir mother as if all that sorrow were subdued by the necessity of\\ntaking courage, and by her childish importance in being able to work,\\nand by her bustling busy way. But now, when Tom cried, although she\\nsat quite tranquil, looking quietly at us, and did not by any\\nmovement disturb a hair of the head of either of her little charges,\\nI saw two silent tears fall down her face.\\n\\nI stood at the window with Ada, pretending to look at the housetops,\\nand the blackened stack of chimneys, and the poor plants, and the\\nbirds in little cages belonging to the neighbours, when I found that\\nMrs. Blinder, from the shop below, had come in (perhaps it had taken\\nher all this time to get upstairs) and was talking to my guardian.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not much to forgive \\'em the rent, sir,\" she said; \"who could\\ntake it from them!\"\\n\\n\"Well, well!\" said my guardian to us two. \"It is enough that the time\\nwill come when this good woman will find that it WAS much, and that\\nforasmuch as she did it unto the least of these--This child,\" he\\nadded after a few moments, \"could she possibly continue this?\"\\n\\n\"Really, sir, I think she might,\" said Mrs. Blinder, getting her\\nheavy breath by painful degrees. \"She\\'s as handy as it\\'s possible to\\nbe. Bless you, sir, the way she tended them two children after the\\nmother died was the talk of the yard! And it was a wonder to see her\\nwith him after he was took ill, it really was! \\'Mrs. Blinder,\\' he\\nsaid to me the very last he spoke--he was lying there--\\'Mrs.\\nBlinder, whatever my calling may have been, I see a angel sitting in\\nthis room last night along with my child, and I trust her to Our\\nFather!\\'\"\\n\\n\"He had no other calling?\" said my guardian.\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" returned Mrs. Blinder, \"he was nothing but a follerers.\\nWhen he first came to lodge here, I didn\\'t know what he was, and I\\nconfess that when I found out I gave him notice. It wasn\\'t liked in\\nthe yard. It wasn\\'t approved by the other lodgers. It is NOT a\\ngenteel calling,\" said Mrs. Blinder, \"and most people do object to\\nit. Mr. Gridley objected to it very strong, and he is a good lodger,\\nthough his temper has been hard tried.\"\\n\\n\"So you gave him notice?\" said my guardian.\\n\\n\"So I gave him notice,\" said Mrs. Blinder. \"But really when the time\\ncame, and I knew no other ill of him, I was in doubts. He was\\npunctual and diligent; he did what he had to do, sir,\" said Mrs.\\nBlinder, unconsciously fixing Mr. Skimpole with her eye, \"and it\\'s\\nsomething in this world even to do that.\"\\n\\n\"So you kept him after all?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I said that if he could arrange with Mr. Gridley, I could\\narrange it with the other lodgers and should not so much mind its\\nbeing liked or disliked in the yard. Mr. Gridley gave his consent\\ngruff--but gave it. He was always gruff with him, but he has been\\nkind to the children since. A person is never known till a person is\\nproved.\"\\n\\n\"Have many people been kind to the children?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Upon the whole, not so bad, sir,\" said Mrs. Blinder; \"but certainly\\nnot so many as would have been if their father\\'s calling had been\\ndifferent. Mr. Coavins gave a guinea, and the follerers made up a\\nlittle purse. Some neighbours in the yard that had always joked and\\ntapped their shoulders when he went by came forward with a little\\nsubscription, and--in general--not so bad. Similarly with Charlotte.\\nSome people won\\'t employ her because she was a follerer\\'s child; some\\npeople that do employ her cast it at her; some make a merit of having\\nher to work for them, with that and all her draw-backs upon her, and\\nperhaps pay her less and put upon her more. But she\\'s patienter than\\nothers would be, and is clever too, and always willing, up to the\\nfull mark of her strength and over. So I should say, in general, not\\nso bad, sir, but might be better.\"\\n\\nMrs. Blinder sat down to give herself a more favourable opportunity\\nof recovering her breath, exhausted anew by so much talking before it\\nwas fully restored. Mr. Jarndyce was turning to speak to us when his\\nattention was attracted by the abrupt entrance into the room of the\\nMr. Gridley who had been mentioned and whom we had seen on our way\\nup.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what you may be doing here, ladies and gentlemen,\" he\\nsaid, as if he resented our presence, \"but you\\'ll excuse my coming\\nin. I don\\'t come in to stare about me. Well, Charley! Well, Tom!\\nWell, little one! How is it with us all to-day?\"\\n\\nHe bent over the group in a caressing way and clearly was regarded as\\na friend by the children, though his face retained its stern\\ncharacter and his manner to us was as rude as it could be. My\\nguardian noticed it and respected it.\\n\\n\"No one, surely, would come here to stare about him,\" he said mildly.\\n\\n\"May be so, sir, may be so,\" returned the other, taking Tom upon his\\nknee and waving him off impatiently. \"I don\\'t want to argue with\\nladies and gentlemen. I have had enough of arguing to last one man\\nhis life.\"\\n\\n\"You have sufficient reason, I dare say,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"for\\nbeing chafed and irritated--\"\\n\\n\"There again!\" exclaimed the man, becoming violently angry. \"I am of\\na quarrelsome temper. I am irascible. I am not polite!\"\\n\\n\"Not very, I think.\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" said Gridley, putting down the child and going up to him as if\\nhe meant to strike him, \"do you know anything of Courts of Equity?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I do, to my sorrow.\"\\n\\n\"To your sorrow?\" said the man, pausing in his wrath, \"if so, I beg\\nyour pardon. I am not polite, I know. I beg your pardon! Sir,\" with\\nrenewed violence, \"I have been dragged for five and twenty years over\\nburning iron, and I have lost the habit of treading upon velvet. Go\\ninto the Court of Chancery yonder and ask what is one of the standing\\njokes that brighten up their business sometimes, and they will tell\\nyou that the best joke they have is the man from Shropshire. I,\" he\\nsaid, beating one hand on the other passionately, \"am the man from\\nShropshire.\"\\n\\n\"I believe I and my family have also had the honour of furnishing\\nsome entertainment in the same grave place,\" said my guardian\\ncomposedly. \"You may have heard my name--Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" said Gridley with a rough sort of salutation, \"you\\nbear your wrongs more quietly than I can bear mine. More than that, I\\ntell you--and I tell this gentleman, and these young ladies, if they\\nare friends of yours--that if I took my wrongs in any other way, I\\nshould be driven mad! It is only by resenting them, and by revenging\\nthem in my mind, and by angrily demanding the justice I never get,\\nthat I am able to keep my wits together. It is only that!\" he said,\\nspeaking in a homely, rustic way and with great vehemence. \"You may\\ntell me that I over-excite myself. I answer that it\\'s in my nature to\\ndo it, under wrong, and I must do it. There\\'s nothing between doing\\nit, and sinking into the smiling state of the poor little mad woman\\nthat haunts the court. If I was once to sit down under it, I should\\nbecome imbecile.\"\\n\\nThe passion and heat in which he was, and the manner in which his\\nface worked, and the violent gestures with which he accompanied what\\nhe said, were most painful to see.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he said, \"consider my case. As true as there is a\\nheaven above us, this is my case. I am one of two brothers. My father\\n(a farmer) made a will and left his farm and stock and so forth to my\\nmother for her life. After my mother\\'s death, all was to come to me\\nexcept a legacy of three hundred pounds that I was then to pay my\\nbrother. My mother died. My brother some time afterwards claimed his\\nlegacy. I and some of my relations said that he had had a part of it\\nalready in board and lodging and some other things. Now mind! That\\nwas the question, and nothing else. No one disputed the will; no one\\ndisputed anything but whether part of that three hundred pounds had\\nbeen already paid or not. To settle that question, my brother filing\\na bill, I was obliged to go into this accursed Chancery; I was forced\\nthere because the law forced me and would let me go nowhere else.\\nSeventeen people were made defendants to that simple suit! It first\\ncame on after two years. It was then stopped for another two years\\nwhile the master (may his head rot off!) inquired whether I was my\\nfather\\'s son, about which there was no dispute at all with any mortal\\ncreature. He then found out that there were not defendants\\nenough--remember, there were only seventeen as yet!--but that we must\\nhave another who had been left out and must begin all over again. The\\ncosts at that time--before the thing was begun!--were three times the\\nlegacy. My brother would have given up the legacy, and joyful, to\\nescape more costs. My whole estate, left to me in that will of my\\nfather\\'s, has gone in costs. The suit, still undecided, has fallen\\ninto rack, and ruin, and despair, with everything else--and here I\\nstand, this day! Now, Mr. Jarndyce, in your suit there are thousands\\nand thousands involved, where in mine there are hundreds. Is mine\\nless hard to bear or is it harder to bear, when my whole living was\\nin it and has been thus shamefully sucked away?\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce said that he condoled with him with all his heart and\\nthat he set up no monopoly himself in being unjustly treated by this\\nmonstrous system.\\n\\n\"There again!\" said Mr. Gridley with no diminution of his rage. \"The\\nsystem! I am told on all hands, it\\'s the system. I mustn\\'t look to\\nindividuals. It\\'s the system. I mustn\\'t go into court and say, \\'My\\nLord, I beg to know this from you--is this right or wrong? Have you\\nthe face to tell me I have received justice and therefore am\\ndismissed?\\' My Lord knows nothing of it. He sits there to administer\\nthe system. I mustn\\'t go to Mr. Tulkinghorn, the solicitor in\\nLincoln\\'s Inn Fields, and say to him when he makes me furious by\\nbeing so cool and satisfied--as they all do, for I know they gain by\\nit while I lose, don\\'t I?--I mustn\\'t say to him, \\'I will have\\nsomething out of some one for my ruin, by fair means or foul!\\' HE is\\nnot responsible. It\\'s the system. But, if I do no violence to any of\\nthem, here--I may! I don\\'t know what may happen if I am carried\\nbeyond myself at last! I will accuse the individual workers of that\\nsystem against me, face to face, before the great eternal bar!\"\\n\\nHis passion was fearful. I could not have believed in such rage\\nwithout seeing it.\\n\\n\"I have done!\" he said, sitting down and wiping his face. \"Mr.\\nJarndyce, I have done! I am violent, I know. I ought to know it. I\\nhave been in prison for contempt of court. I have been in prison for\\nthreatening the solicitor. I have been in this trouble, and that\\ntrouble, and shall be again. I am the man from Shropshire, and I\\nsometimes go beyond amusing them, though they have found it amusing,\\ntoo, to see me committed into custody and brought up in custody and\\nall that. It would be better for me, they tell me, if I restrained\\nmyself. I tell them that if I did restrain myself I should become\\nimbecile. I was a good-enough-tempered man once, I believe. People in\\nmy part of the country say they remember me so, but now I must have\\nthis vent under my sense of injury or nothing could hold my wits\\ntogether. It would be far better for you, Mr. Gridley,\\' the Lord\\nChancellor told me last week, \\'not to waste your time here, and to\\nstay, usefully employed, down in Shropshire.\\' \\'My Lord, my Lord, I\\nknow it would,\\' said I to him, \\'and it would have been far better for\\nme never to have heard the name of your high office, but unhappily\\nfor me, I can\\'t undo the past, and the past drives me here!\\'\\nBesides,\" he added, breaking fiercely out, \"I\\'ll shame them. To the\\nlast, I\\'ll show myself in that court to its shame. If I knew when I\\nwas going to die, and could be carried there, and had a voice to\\nspeak with, I would die there, saying, \\'You have brought me here and\\nsent me from here many and many a time. Now send me out feet\\nforemost!\\'\"\\n\\nHis countenance had, perhaps for years, become so set in its\\ncontentious expression that it did not soften, even now when he was\\nquiet.\\n\\n\"I came to take these babies down to my room for an hour,\" he said,\\ngoing to them again, \"and let them play about. I didn\\'t mean to say\\nall this, but it don\\'t much signify. You\\'re not afraid of me, Tom,\\nare you?\"\\n\\n\"No!\" said Tom. \"You ain\\'t angry with ME.\"\\n\\n\"You are right, my child. You\\'re going back, Charley? Aye? Come then,\\nlittle one!\" He took the youngest child on his arm, where she was\\nwilling enough to be carried. \"I shouldn\\'t wonder if we found a\\nginger-bread soldier downstairs. Let\\'s go and look for him!\"\\n\\nHe made his former rough salutation, which was not deficient in a\\ncertain respect, to Mr. Jarndyce, and bowing slightly to us, went\\ndownstairs to his room.\\n\\nUpon that, Mr. Skimpole began to talk, for the first time since our\\narrival, in his usual gay strain. He said, Well, it was really very\\npleasant to see how things lazily adapted themselves to purposes.\\nHere was this Mr. Gridley, a man of a robust will and surprising\\nenergy--intellectually speaking, a sort of inharmonious\\nblacksmith--and he could easily imagine that there Gridley was, years\\nago, wandering about in life for something to expend his superfluous\\ncombativeness upon--a sort of Young Love among the thorns--when the\\nCourt of Chancery came in his way and accommodated him with the exact\\nthing he wanted. There they were, matched, ever afterwards! Otherwise\\nhe might have been a great general, blowing up all sorts of towns, or\\nhe might have been a great politician, dealing in all sorts of\\nparliamentary rhetoric; but as it was, he and the Court of Chancery\\nhad fallen upon each other in the pleasantest way, and nobody was\\nmuch the worse, and Gridley was, so to speak, from that hour provided\\nfor. Then look at Coavinses! How delightfully poor Coavinses (father\\nof these charming children) illustrated the same principle! He, Mr.\\nSkimpole, himself, had sometimes repined at the existence of\\nCoavinses. He had found Coavinses in his way. He could had dispensed\\nwith Coavinses. There had been times when, if he had been a sultan,\\nand his grand vizier had said one morning, \"What does the Commander\\nof the Faithful require at the hands of his slave?\" he might have\\neven gone so far as to reply, \"The head of Coavinses!\" But what\\nturned out to be the case? That, all that time, he had been giving\\nemployment to a most deserving man, that he had been a benefactor to\\nCoavinses, that he had actually been enabling Coavinses to bring up\\nthese charming children in this agreeable way, developing these\\nsocial virtues! Insomuch that his heart had just now swelled and the\\ntears had come into his eyes when he had looked round the room and\\nthought, \"I was the great patron of Coavinses, and his little\\ncomforts were MY work!\"\\n\\nThere was something so captivating in his light way of touching these\\nfantastic strings, and he was such a mirthful child by the side of\\nthe graver childhood we had seen, that he made my guardian smile even\\nas he turned towards us from a little private talk with Mrs. Blinder.\\nWe kissed Charley, and took her downstairs with us, and stopped\\noutside the house to see her run away to her work. I don\\'t know where\\nshe was going, but we saw her run, such a little, little creature in\\nher womanly bonnet and apron, through a covered way at the bottom of\\nthe court and melt into the city\\'s strife and sound like a dewdrop in\\nan ocean.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy Lady Dedlock is restless, very restless. The astonished\\nfashionable intelligence hardly knows where to have her. To-day she\\nis at Chesney Wold; yesterday she was at her house in town; to-morrow\\nshe may be abroad, for anything the fashionable intelligence can with\\nconfidence predict. Even Sir Leicester\\'s gallantry has some trouble\\nto keep pace with her. It would have more but that his other faithful\\nally, for better and for worse--the gout--darts into the old oak\\nbed-chamber at Chesney Wold and grips him by both legs.\\n\\nSir Leicester receives the gout as a troublesome demon, but still a\\ndemon of the patrician order. All the Dedlocks, in the direct male\\nline, through a course of time during and beyond which the memory of\\nman goeth not to the contrary, have had the gout. It can be proved,\\nsir. Other men\\'s fathers may have died of the rheumatism or may have\\ntaken base contagion from the tainted blood of the sick vulgar, but\\nthe Dedlock family have communicated something exclusive even to the\\nlevelling process of dying by dying of their own family gout. It has\\ncome down through the illustrious line like the plate, or the\\npictures, or the place in Lincolnshire. It is among their dignities.\\nSir Leicester is perhaps not wholly without an impression, though he\\nhas never resolved it into words, that the angel of death in the\\ndischarge of his necessary duties may observe to the shades of the\\naristocracy, \"My lords and gentlemen, I have the honour to present to\\nyou another Dedlock certified to have arrived per the family gout.\"\\n\\nHence Sir Leicester yields up his family legs to the family disorder\\nas if he held his name and fortune on that feudal tenure. He feels\\nthat for a Dedlock to be laid upon his back and spasmodically\\ntwitched and stabbed in his extremities is a liberty taken somewhere,\\nbut he thinks, \"We have all yielded to this; it belongs to us; it has\\nfor some hundreds of years been understood that we are not to make\\nthe vaults in the park interesting on more ignoble terms; and I\\nsubmit myself to the compromise.\"\\n\\nAnd a goodly show he makes, lying in a flush of crimson and gold in\\nthe midst of the great drawing-room before his favourite picture of\\nmy Lady, with broad strips of sunlight shining in, down the long\\nperspective, through the long line of windows, and alternating with\\nsoft reliefs of shadow. Outside, the stately oaks, rooted for ages in\\nthe green ground which has never known ploughshare, but was still a\\nchase when kings rode to battle with sword and shield and rode\\na-hunting with bow and arrow, bear witness to his greatness. Inside,\\nhis forefathers, looking on him from the walls, say, \"Each of us was\\na passing reality here and left this coloured shadow of himself and\\nmelted into remembrance as dreamy as the distant voices of the rooks\\nnow lulling you to rest,\" and hear their testimony to his greatness\\ntoo. And he is very great this day. And woe to Boythorn or other\\ndaring wight who shall presumptuously contest an inch with him!\\n\\nMy Lady is at present represented, near Sir Leicester, by her\\nportrait. She has flitted away to town, with no intention of\\nremaining there, and will soon flit hither again, to the confusion of\\nthe fashionable intelligence. The house in town is not prepared for\\nher reception. It is muffled and dreary. Only one Mercury in powder\\ngapes disconsolate at the hall-window; and he mentioned last night to\\nanother Mercury of his acquaintance, also accustomed to good society,\\nthat if that sort of thing was to last--which it couldn\\'t, for a man\\nof his spirits couldn\\'t bear it, and a man of his figure couldn\\'t be\\nexpected to bear it--there would be no resource for him, upon his\\nhonour, but to cut his throat!\\n\\nWhat connexion can there be between the place in Lincolnshire, the\\nhouse in town, the Mercury in powder, and the whereabout of Jo the\\noutlaw with the broom, who had that distant ray of light upon him\\nwhen he swept the churchyard-step? What connexion can there have been\\nbetween many people in the innumerable histories of this world who\\nfrom opposite sides of great gulfs have, nevertheless, been very\\ncuriously brought together!\\n\\nJo sweeps his crossing all day long, unconscious of the link, if any\\nlink there be. He sums up his mental condition when asked a question\\nby replying that he \"don\\'t know nothink.\" He knows that it\\'s hard to\\nkeep the mud off the crossing in dirty weather, and harder still to\\nlive by doing it. Nobody taught him even that much; he found it out.\\n\\nJo lives--that is to say, Jo has not yet died--in a ruinous place\\nknown to the like of him by the name of Tom-all-Alone\\'s. It is a\\nblack, dilapidated street, avoided by all decent people, where the\\ncrazy houses were seized upon, when their decay was far advanced, by\\nsome bold vagrants who after establishing their own possession took\\nto letting them out in lodgings. Now, these tumbling tenements\\ncontain, by night, a swarm of misery. As on the ruined human wretch\\nvermin parasites appear, so these ruined shelters have bred a crowd\\nof foul existence that crawls in and out of gaps in walls and boards;\\nand coils itself to sleep, in maggot numbers, where the rain drips\\nin; and comes and goes, fetching and carrying fever and sowing more\\nevil in its every footprint than Lord Coodle, and Sir Thomas Doodle,\\nand the Duke of Foodle, and all the fine gentlemen in office, down to\\nZoodle, shall set right in five hundred years--though born expressly\\nto do it.\\n\\nTwice lately there has been a crash and a cloud of dust, like the\\nspringing of a mine, in Tom-all-Alone\\'s; and each time a house has\\nfallen. These accidents have made a paragraph in the newspapers and\\nhave filled a bed or two in the nearest hospital. The gaps remain,\\nand there are not unpopular lodgings among the rubbish. As several\\nmore houses are nearly ready to go, the next crash in Tom-all-Alone\\'s\\nmay be expected to be a good one.\\n\\nThis desirable property is in Chancery, of course. It would be an\\ninsult to the discernment of any man with half an eye to tell him so.\\nWhether \"Tom\" is the popular representative of the original plaintiff\\nor defendant in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, or whether Tom lived here when\\nthe suit had laid the street waste, all alone, until other settlers\\ncame to join him, or whether the traditional title is a comprehensive\\nname for a retreat cut off from honest company and put out of the\\npale of hope, perhaps nobody knows. Certainly Jo don\\'t know.\\n\\n\"For I don\\'t,\" says Jo, \"I don\\'t know nothink.\"\\n\\nIt must be a strange state to be like Jo! To shuffle through the\\nstreets, unfamiliar with the shapes, and in utter darkness as to the\\nmeaning, of those mysterious symbols, so abundant over the shops, and\\nat the corners of streets, and on the doors, and in the windows! To\\nsee people read, and to see people write, and to see the postmen\\ndeliver letters, and not to have the least idea of all that\\nlanguage--to be, to every scrap of it, stone blind and dumb! It must\\nbe very puzzling to see the good company going to the churches on\\nSundays, with their books in their hands, and to think (for perhaps\\nJo DOES think at odd times) what does it all mean, and if it means\\nanything to anybody, how comes it that it means nothing to me? To be\\nhustled, and jostled, and moved on; and really to feel that it would\\nappear to be perfectly true that I have no business here, or there,\\nor anywhere; and yet to be perplexed by the consideration that I AM\\nhere somehow, too, and everybody overlooked me until I became the\\ncreature that I am! It must be a strange state, not merely to be told\\nthat I am scarcely human (as in the case of my offering myself for a\\nwitness), but to feel it of my own knowledge all my life! To see the\\nhorses, dogs, and cattle go by me and to know that in ignorance I\\nbelong to them and not to the superior beings in my shape, whose\\ndelicacy I offend! Jo\\'s ideas of a criminal trial, or a judge, or a\\nbishop, or a government, or that inestimable jewel to him (if he only\\nknew it) the Constitution, should be strange! His whole material and\\nimmaterial life is wonderfully strange; his death, the strangest\\nthing of all.\\n\\nJo comes out of Tom-all-Alone\\'s, meeting the tardy morning which is\\nalways late in getting down there, and munches his dirty bit of bread\\nas he comes along. His way lying through many streets, and the houses\\nnot yet being open, he sits down to breakfast on the door-step of the\\nSociety for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and gives\\nit a brush when he has finished as an acknowledgment of the\\naccommodation. He admires the size of the edifice and wonders what\\nit\\'s all about. He has no idea, poor wretch, of the spiritual\\ndestitution of a coral reef in the Pacific or what it costs to look\\nup the precious souls among the coco-nuts and bread-fruit.\\n\\nHe goes to his crossing and begins to lay it out for the day. The\\ntown awakes; the great tee-totum is set up for its daily spin and\\nwhirl; all that unaccountable reading and writing, which has been\\nsuspended for a few hours, recommences. Jo and the other lower\\nanimals get on in the unintelligible mess as they can. It is\\nmarket-day. The blinded oxen, over-goaded, over-driven, never guided,\\nrun into wrong places and are beaten out, and plunge red-eyed and\\nfoaming at stone walls, and often sorely hurt the innocent, and often\\nsorely hurt themselves. Very like Jo and his order; very, very like!\\n\\nA band of music comes and plays. Jo listens to it. So does a dog--a\\ndrover\\'s dog, waiting for his master outside a butcher\\'s shop, and\\nevidently thinking about those sheep he has had upon his mind for\\nsome hours and is happily rid of. He seems perplexed respecting three\\nor four, can\\'t remember where he left them, looks up and down the\\nstreet as half expecting to see them astray, suddenly pricks up his\\nears and remembers all about it. A thoroughly vagabond dog,\\naccustomed to low company and public-houses; a terrific dog to sheep,\\nready at a whistle to scamper over their backs and tear out mouthfuls\\nof their wool; but an educated, improved, developed dog who has been\\ntaught his duties and knows how to discharge them. He and Jo listen\\nto the music, probably with much the same amount of animal\\nsatisfaction; likewise as to awakened association, aspiration, or\\nregret, melancholy or joyful reference to things beyond the senses,\\nthey are probably upon a par. But, otherwise, how far above the human\\nlistener is the brute!\\n\\nTurn that dog\\'s descendants wild, like Jo, and in a very few years\\nthey will so degenerate that they will lose even their bark--but not\\ntheir bite.\\n\\nThe day changes as it wears itself away and becomes dark and drizzly.\\nJo fights it out at his crossing among the mud and wheels, the\\nhorses, whips, and umbrellas, and gets but a scanty sum to pay for\\nthe unsavoury shelter of Tom-all-Alone\\'s. Twilight comes on; gas\\nbegins to start up in the shops; the lamplighter, with his ladder,\\nruns along the margin of the pavement. A wretched evening is\\nbeginning to close in.\\n\\nIn his chambers Mr. Tulkinghorn sits meditating an application to the\\nnearest magistrate to-morrow morning for a warrant. Gridley, a\\ndisappointed suitor, has been here to-day and has been alarming. We\\nare not to be put in bodily fear, and that ill-conditioned fellow\\nshall be held to bail again. From the ceiling, foreshortened\\nAllegory, in the person of one impossible Roman upside down, points\\nwith the arm of Samson (out of joint, and an odd one) obtrusively\\ntoward the window. Why should Mr. Tulkinghorn, for such no reason,\\nlook out of window? Is the hand not always pointing there? So he does\\nnot look out of window.\\n\\nAnd if he did, what would it be to see a woman going by? There are\\nwomen enough in the world, Mr. Tulkinghorn thinks--too many; they are\\nat the bottom of all that goes wrong in it, though, for the matter of\\nthat, they create business for lawyers. What would it be to see a\\nwoman going by, even though she were going secretly? They are all\\nsecret. Mr. Tulkinghorn knows that very well.\\n\\nBut they are not all like the woman who now leaves him and his house\\nbehind, between whose plain dress and her refined manner there is\\nsomething exceedingly inconsistent. She should be an upper servant by\\nher attire, yet in her air and step, though both are hurried and\\nassumed--as far as she can assume in the muddy streets, which she\\ntreads with an unaccustomed foot--she is a lady. Her face is veiled,\\nand still she sufficiently betrays herself to make more than one of\\nthose who pass her look round sharply.\\n\\nShe never turns her head. Lady or servant, she has a purpose in her\\nand can follow it. She never turns her head until she comes to the\\ncrossing where Jo plies with his broom. He crosses with her and begs.\\nStill, she does not turn her head until she has landed on the other\\nside. Then she slightly beckons to him and says, \"Come here!\"\\n\\nJo follows her a pace or two into a quiet court.\\n\\n\"Are you the boy I\\'ve read of in the papers?\" she asked behind her\\nveil.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" says Jo, staring moodily at the veil, \"nothink about\\nno papers. I don\\'t know nothink about nothink at all.\"\\n\\n\"Were you examined at an inquest?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know nothink about no--where I was took by the beadle, do\\nyou mean?\" says Jo. \"Was the boy\\'s name at the inkwhich Jo?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s me!\" says Jo.\\n\\n\"Come farther up.\"\\n\\n\"You mean about the man?\" says Jo, following. \"Him as wos dead?\"\\n\\n\"Hush! Speak in a whisper! Yes. Did he look, when he was living, so\\nvery ill and poor?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, jist!\" says Jo.\\n\\n\"Did he look like--not like YOU?\" says the woman with abhorrence.\\n\\n\"Oh, not so bad as me,\" says Jo. \"I\\'m a reg\\'lar one I am! You didn\\'t\\nknow him, did you?\"\\n\\n\"How dare you ask me if I knew him?\"\\n\\n\"No offence, my lady,\" says Jo with much humility, for even he has\\ngot at the suspicion of her being a lady.\\n\\n\"I am not a lady. I am a servant.\"\\n\\n\"You are a jolly servant!\" says Jo without the least idea of saying\\nanything offensive, merely as a tribute of admiration.\\n\\n\"Listen and be silent. Don\\'t talk to me, and stand farther from me!\\nCan you show me all those places that were spoken of in the account I\\nread? The place he wrote for, the place he died at, the place where\\nyou were taken to, and the place where he was buried? Do you know the\\nplace where he was buried?\"\\n\\nJo answers with a nod, having also nodded as each other place was\\nmentioned.\\n\\n\"Go before me and show me all those dreadful places. Stop opposite to\\neach, and don\\'t speak to me unless I speak to you. Don\\'t look back.\\nDo what I want, and I will pay you well.\"\\n\\nJo attends closely while the words are being spoken; tells them off\\non his broom-handle, finding them rather hard; pauses to consider\\ntheir meaning; considers it satisfactory; and nods his ragged head.\\n\\n\"I\\'m fly,\" says Jo. \"But fen larks, you know. Stow hooking it!\"\\n\\n\"What does the horrible creature mean?\" exclaims the servant,\\nrecoiling from him.\\n\\n\"Stow cutting away, you know!\" says Jo.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand you. Go on before! I will give you more money\\nthan you ever had in your life.\"\\n\\nJo screws up his mouth into a whistle, gives his ragged head a rub,\\ntakes his broom under his arm, and leads the way, passing deftly with\\nhis bare feet over the hard stones and through the mud and mire.\\n\\nCook\\'s Court. Jo stops. A pause.\\n\\n\"Who lives here?\"\\n\\n\"Him wot give him his writing and give me half a bull,\" says Jo in a\\nwhisper without looking over his shoulder.\\n\\n\"Go on to the next.\"\\n\\nKrook\\'s house. Jo stops again. A longer pause.\\n\\n\"Who lives here?\"\\n\\n\"HE lived here,\" Jo answers as before.\\n\\nAfter a silence he is asked, \"In which room?\"\\n\\n\"In the back room up there. You can see the winder from this corner.\\nUp there! That\\'s where I see him stritched out. This is the\\npublic-ouse where I was took to.\"\\n\\n\"Go on to the next!\"\\n\\nIt is a longer walk to the next, but Jo, relieved of his first\\nsuspicions, sticks to the forms imposed upon him and does not look\\nround. By many devious ways, reeking with offence of many kinds, they\\ncome to the little tunnel of a court, and to the gas-lamp (lighted\\nnow), and to the iron gate.\\n\\n\"He was put there,\" says Jo, holding to the bars and looking in.\\n\\n\"Where? Oh, what a scene of horror!\"\\n\\n\"There!\" says Jo, pointing. \"Over yinder. Among them piles of bones,\\nand close to that there kitchin winder! They put him wery nigh the\\ntop. They was obliged to stamp upon it to git it in. I could unkiver\\nit for you with my broom if the gate was open. That\\'s why they locks\\nit, I s\\'pose,\" giving it a shake. \"It\\'s always locked. Look at the\\nrat!\" cries Jo, excited. \"Hi! Look! There he goes! Ho! Into the\\nground!\"\\n\\nThe servant shrinks into a corner, into a corner of that hideous\\narchway, with its deadly stains contaminating her dress; and putting\\nout her two hands and passionately telling him to keep away from her,\\nfor he is loathsome to her, so remains for some moments. Jo stands\\nstaring and is still staring when she recovers herself.\\n\\n\"Is this place of abomination consecrated ground?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know nothink of consequential ground,\" says Jo, still\\nstaring.\\n\\n\"Is it blessed?\"\\n\\n\"Which?\" says Jo, in the last degree amazed.\\n\\n\"Is it blessed?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m blest if I know,\" says Jo, staring more than ever; \"but I\\nshouldn\\'t think it warn\\'t. Blest?\" repeats Jo, something troubled in\\nhis mind. \"It an\\'t done it much good if it is. Blest? I should think\\nit was t\\'othered myself. But I don\\'t know nothink!\"\\n\\nThe servant takes as little heed of what he says as she seems to take\\nof what she has said herself. She draws off her glove to get some\\nmoney from her purse. Jo silently notices how white and small her\\nhand is and what a jolly servant she must be to wear such sparkling\\nrings.\\n\\nShe drops a piece of money in his hand without touching it, and\\nshuddering as their hands approach. \"Now,\" she adds, \"show me the\\nspot again!\"\\n\\nJo thrusts the handle of his broom between the bars of the gate, and\\nwith his utmost power of elaboration, points it out. At length,\\nlooking aside to see if he has made himself intelligible, he finds\\nthat he is alone.\\n\\nHis first proceeding is to hold the piece of money to the gas-light\\nand to be overpowered at finding that it is yellow--gold. His next is\\nto give it a one-sided bite at the edge as a test of its quality.\\nHis next, to put it in his mouth for safety and to sweep the\\nstep and passage with great care. His job done, he sets off for\\nTom-all-Alone\\'s, stopping in the light of innumerable gas-lamps to\\nproduce the piece of gold and give it another one-sided bite as a\\nreassurance of its being genuine.\\n\\nThe Mercury in powder is in no want of society to-night, for my Lady\\ngoes to a grand dinner and three or four balls. Sir Leicester is\\nfidgety down at Chesney Wold, with no better company than the gout;\\nhe complains to Mrs. Rouncewell that the rain makes such a monotonous\\npattering on the terrace that he can\\'t read the paper even by the\\nfireside in his own snug dressing-room.\\n\\n\"Sir Leicester would have done better to try the other side of the\\nhouse, my dear,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell to Rosa. \"His dressing-room is\\non my Lady\\'s side.

Before breakfast, she proposes a walk, and all the young people agree. Esther again shows kindness to Peepy, washing him and putting him to sleep in her bed. Esther, Ada, Caddy, and Richard take their first walk about London.\\n\\nThey soon meet Miss Flite again, who begs them to come to her lodgings. They go and visit Krook\\'s rag-and-bottle shop, above which is Miss Flite\\'s room. As they enter, Esther sees a legal handwritten advertisement for Mr. Nemo, requesting work as a law writer (copyist). Neither Esther nor we yet know it, but she is looking at the handwriting of her father and entering the house where he lives.\\n\\nThe group meets Mr. Krook, who is obsessed with Chancery documents. He rambles on about the Jarndyce suit, mentioning the names Barbary, Clare, and Dedlock, giving Esther, unaware, two more names of her mysterious parentage. They see Miss Flite\\'s bare and sad room, and Richard surreptitiously leaves some money for her. They return to the Jellyby house, much affected by the sad states to which Chancery can reduce people.\\n\\nIn Chapter 6, the long awaited meeting with Mr. Jarndyce happens at his home, Bleak House. He is described as a handsome, robust man in his 50s -- exceedingly kindly, genteel, and self-effacing. He has a little quirk of mentioning the \"east wind\" whenever something he doesn\\'t like is brought up. The three young people instantly like and feel affection for their mutual benefactor.\\n\\nA \"perfect child\" is abruptly introduced -- the parasitic poet, Mr. Skimpole. The three young people are instantly brought into his inbroglios when the bailiff, a man called Neckett, arrives and demands payment of a debt. Richard and Esther come to the rescue, and, upon learning of it, Mr. Jarndyce warns them not to give money to Skimpole.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, Esther is given the keys to the household, the mark of the housekeeper of Bleak House. She is excited and honored to have this position. She sets up residence in a room adjoining Ada\\'s, with a sitting room in between, and everything in the house is to the young people\\'s liking.\\n\\nChapter 7 is back in Chesney Wold. Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock have left for Paris. The rain continues, and Mrs. Rouncewell, the aged housekeeper, is introduced. She is instructing a young village girl of considerable beauty in the ways of housekeeping and maid\\'s work in a great house. Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s grandson, Watt, who loves Rosa, is visiting.\\n\\nIn the midst of the rain a couple of visitors come to see the house, but are told it \"isn\\'t the day\". They persist, and are admitted, by using Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s name. Mr. Guppy and his friend are brought through the house, and Mr. Guppy admires a portrait of Lady Dedlock. He exclaims that he must have seen the subject somewhere before. Guppy, who had met Esther Summerson briefly in London at Kenge and Carboy\\'s, is unconsciously remembering Lady Dedlock\\'s resemblence to Esther. Guppy leaves a bit perplexed.\\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell had refused to tell the family ghost story, but now recounts it to her grandson and her charge, Rosa. The Ghost\\'s Walk is a terraced walk outside the house, and an eerie footstep is often heard echoing from it. It is supposed that two hundred years ago, a previous Lady Dedlock had sabotaged horses meant for Cavaliers fighting Cromwellian forces. She had lamed them, and, upon being discovered, was lamed herself by her husband in a struggle. She was limping on the terrace and fell and died, and she vowed to haunt the terrace until \"the pride of the house is tumbled.\" Watt and Rosa can still hear the phantom footsteps. ', 'text': 'Although the morning was raw, and although the fog still seemed\\nheavy--I say seemed, for the windows were so encrusted with dirt that\\nthey would have made midsummer sunshine dim--I was sufficiently\\nforewarned of the discomfort within doors at that early hour and\\nsufficiently curious about London to think it a good idea on the part\\nof Miss Jellyby when she proposed that we should go out for a walk.\\n\\n\"Ma won\\'t be down for ever so long,\" she said, \"and then it\\'s a\\nchance if breakfast\\'s ready for an hour afterwards, they dawdle so.\\nAs to Pa, he gets what he can and goes to the office. He never has\\nwhat you would call a regular breakfast. Priscilla leaves him out the\\nloaf and some milk, when there is any, overnight. Sometimes there\\nisn\\'t any milk, and sometimes the cat drinks it. But I\\'m afraid you\\nmust be tired, Miss Summerson, and perhaps you would rather go to\\nbed.\"\\n\\n\"I am not at all tired, my dear,\" said I, \"and would much prefer to\\ngo out.\"\\n\\n\"If you\\'re sure you would,\" returned Miss Jellyby, \"I\\'ll get my\\nthings on.\"\\n\\nAda said she would go too, and was soon astir. I made a proposal to\\nPeepy, in default of being able to do anything better for him, that\\nhe should let me wash him and afterwards lay him down on my bed\\nagain. To this he submitted with the best grace possible, staring at\\nme during the whole operation as if he never had been, and never\\ncould again be, so astonished in his life--looking very miserable\\nalso, certainly, but making no complaint, and going snugly to sleep\\nas soon as it was over. At first I was in two minds about taking such\\na liberty, but I soon reflected that nobody in the house was likely\\nto notice it.\\n\\nWhat with the bustle of dispatching Peepy and the bustle of getting\\nmyself ready and helping Ada, I was soon quite in a glow. We found\\nMiss Jellyby trying to warm herself at the fire in the writing-room,\\nwhich Priscilla was then lighting with a smutty parlour candlestick,\\nthrowing the candle in to make it burn better. Everything was just as\\nwe had left it last night and was evidently intended to remain so.\\nBelow-stairs the dinner-cloth had not been taken away, but had been\\nleft ready for breakfast. Crumbs, dust, and waste-paper were all over\\nthe house. Some pewter pots and a milk-can hung on the area railings;\\nthe door stood open; and we met the cook round the corner coming out\\nof a public-house, wiping her mouth. She mentioned, as she passed us,\\nthat she had been to see what o\\'clock it was.\\n\\nBut before we met the cook, we met Richard, who was dancing up and\\ndown Thavies Inn to warm his feet. He was agreeably surprised to see\\nus stirring so soon and said he would gladly share our walk. So he\\ntook care of Ada, and Miss Jellyby and I went first. I may mention\\nthat Miss Jellyby had relapsed into her sulky manner and that I\\nreally should not have thought she liked me much unless she had told\\nme so.\\n\\n\"Where would you wish to go?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Anywhere, my dear,\" I replied.\\n\\n\"Anywhere\\'s nowhere,\" said Miss Jellyby, stopping perversely.\\n\\n\"Let us go somewhere at any rate,\" said I.\\n\\nShe then walked me on very fast.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care!\" she said. \"Now, you are my witness, Miss Summerson, I\\nsay I don\\'t care--but if he was to come to our house with his great,\\nshining, lumpy forehead night after night till he was as old as\\nMethuselah, I wouldn\\'t have anything to say to him. Such ASSES as he\\nand Ma make of themselves!\"\\n\\n\"My dear!\" I remonstrated, in allusion to the epithet and the\\nvigorous emphasis Miss Jellyby set upon it. \"Your duty as a child--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Don\\'t talk of duty as a child, Miss Summerson; where\\'s Ma\\'s duty\\nas a parent? All made over to the public and Africa, I suppose! Then\\nlet the public and Africa show duty as a child; it\\'s much more their\\naffair than mine. You are shocked, I dare say! Very well, so am I\\nshocked too; so we are both shocked, and there\\'s an end of it!\"\\n\\nShe walked me on faster yet.\\n\\n\"But for all that, I say again, he may come, and come, and come, and\\nI won\\'t have anything to say to him. I can\\'t bear him. If there\\'s any\\nstuff in the world that I hate and detest, it\\'s the stuff he and Ma\\ntalk. I wonder the very paving-stones opposite our house can have the\\npatience to stay there and be a witness of such inconsistencies and\\ncontradictions as all that sounding nonsense, and Ma\\'s management!\"\\n\\nI could not but understand her to refer to Mr. Quale, the young\\ngentleman who had appeared after dinner yesterday. I was saved the\\ndisagreeable necessity of pursuing the subject by Richard and Ada\\ncoming up at a round pace, laughing and asking us if we meant to run\\na race. Thus interrupted, Miss Jellyby became silent and walked\\nmoodily on at my side while I admired the long successions and\\nvarieties of streets, the quantity of people already going to and\\nfro, the number of vehicles passing and repassing, the busy\\npreparations in the setting forth of shop windows and the sweeping\\nout of shops, and the extraordinary creatures in rags secretly\\ngroping among the swept-out rubbish for pins and other refuse.\\n\\n\"So, cousin,\" said the cheerful voice of Richard to Ada behind me.\\n\"We are never to get out of Chancery! We have come by another way to\\nour place of meeting yesterday, and--by the Great Seal, here\\'s the\\nold lady again!\"\\n\\nTruly, there she was, immediately in front of us, curtsying, and\\nsmiling, and saying with her yesterday\\'s air of patronage, \"The wards\\nin Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy, I am sure!\"\\n\\n\"You are out early, ma\\'am,\" said I as she curtsied to me.\\n\\n\"Ye-es! I usually walk here early. Before the court sits. It\\'s\\nretired. I collect my thoughts here for the business of the day,\"\\nsaid the old lady mincingly. \"The business of the day requires a\\ngreat deal of thought. Chancery justice is so ve-ry difficult to\\nfollow.\"\\n\\n\"Who\\'s this, Miss Summerson?\" whispered Miss Jellyby, drawing my arm\\ntighter through her own.\\n\\nThe little old lady\\'s hearing was remarkably quick. She answered for\\nherself directly.\\n\\n\"A suitor, my child. At your service. I have the honour to attend\\ncourt regularly. With my documents. Have I the pleasure of addressing\\nanother of the youthful parties in Jarndyce?\" said the old lady,\\nrecovering herself, with her head on one side, from a very low\\ncurtsy.\\n\\nRichard, anxious to atone for his thoughtlessness of yesterday,\\ngood-naturedly explained that Miss Jellyby was not connected with the\\nsuit.\\n\\n\"Ha!\" said the old lady. \"She does not expect a judgment? She will\\nstill grow old. But not so old. Oh, dear, no! This is the garden of\\nLincoln\\'s Inn. I call it my garden. It is quite a bower in the\\nsummer-time. Where the birds sing melodiously. I pass the greater\\npart of the long vacation here. In contemplation. You find the long\\nvacation exceedingly long, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\nWe said yes, as she seemed to expect us to say so.\\n\\n\"When the leaves are falling from the trees and there are no more\\nflowers in bloom to make up into nosegays for the Lord Chancellor\\'s\\ncourt,\" said the old lady, \"the vacation is fulfilled and the sixth\\nseal, mentioned in the Revelations, again prevails. Pray come and see\\nmy lodging. It will be a good omen for me. Youth, and hope, and\\nbeauty are very seldom there. It is a long, long time since I had a\\nvisit from either.\"\\n\\nShe had taken my hand, and leading me and Miss Jellyby away, beckoned\\nRichard and Ada to come too. I did not know how to excuse myself and\\nlooked to Richard for aid. As he was half amused and half curious and\\nall in doubt how to get rid of the old lady without offence, she\\ncontinued to lead us away, and he and Ada continued to follow, our\\nstrange conductress informing us all the time, with much smiling\\ncondescension, that she lived close by.\\n\\nIt was quite true, as it soon appeared. She lived so close by that we\\nhad not time to have done humouring her for a few moments before she\\nwas at home. Slipping us out at a little side gate, the old lady\\nstopped most unexpectedly in a narrow back street, part of some\\ncourts and lanes immediately outside the wall of the inn, and said,\\n\"This is my lodging. Pray walk up!\"\\n\\nShe had stopped at a shop over which was written KROOK, RAG AND\\nBOTTLE WAREHOUSE. Also, in long thin letters, KROOK, DEALER IN MARINE\\nSTORES. In one part of the window was a picture of a red paper mill\\nat which a cart was unloading a quantity of sacks of old rags. In\\nanother was the inscription BONES BOUGHT. In another, KITCHEN-STUFF\\nBOUGHT. In another, OLD IRON BOUGHT. In another, WASTE-PAPER BOUGHT.\\nIn another, LADIES\\' AND GENTLEMEN\\'S WARDROBES BOUGHT. Everything\\nseemed to be bought and nothing to be sold there. In all parts of the\\nwindow were quantities of dirty bottles--blacking bottles, medicine\\nbottles, ginger-beer and soda-water bottles, pickle bottles, wine\\nbottles, ink bottles; I am reminded by mentioning the latter that the\\nshop had in several little particulars the air of being in a legal\\nneighbourhood and of being, as it were, a dirty hanger-on and\\ndisowned relation of the law. There were a great many ink bottles.\\nThere was a little tottering bench of shabby old volumes outside the\\ndoor, labelled \"Law Books, all at 9d.\" Some of the inscriptions I\\nhave enumerated were written in law-hand, like the papers I had seen\\nin Kenge and Carboy\\'s office and the letters I had so long received\\nfrom the firm. Among them was one, in the same writing, having\\nnothing to do with the business of the shop, but announcing that a\\nrespectable man aged forty-five wanted engrossing or copying to\\nexecute with neatness and dispatch: Address to Nemo, care of Mr.\\nKrook, within. There were several second-hand bags, blue and red,\\nhanging up. A little way within the shop-door lay heaps of old\\ncrackled parchment scrolls and discoloured and dog\\'s-eared\\nlaw-papers. I could have fancied that all the rusty keys, of which\\nthere must have been hundreds huddled together as old iron, had once\\nbelonged to doors of rooms or strong chests in lawyers\\' offices. The\\nlitter of rags tumbled partly into and partly out of a one-legged\\nwooden scale, hanging without any counterpoise from a beam, might\\nhave been counsellors\\' bands and gowns torn up. One had only to\\nfancy, as Richard whispered to Ada and me while we all stood looking\\nin, that yonder bones in a corner, piled together and picked very\\nclean, were the bones of clients, to make the picture complete.\\n\\nAs it was still foggy and dark, and as the shop was blinded besides\\nby the wall of Lincoln\\'s Inn, intercepting the light within a couple\\nof yards, we should not have seen so much but for a lighted lantern\\nthat an old man in spectacles and a hairy cap was carrying about in\\nthe shop. Turning towards the door, he now caught sight of us. He was\\nshort, cadaverous, and withered, with his head sunk sideways between\\nhis shoulders and the breath issuing in visible smoke from his mouth\\nas if he were on fire within. His throat, chin, and eyebrows were so\\nfrosted with white hairs and so gnarled with veins and puckered skin\\nthat he looked from his breast upward like some old root in a fall of\\nsnow.\\n\\n\"Hi, hi!\" said the old man, coming to the door. \"Have you anything to\\nsell?\"\\n\\nWe naturally drew back and glanced at our conductress, who had been\\ntrying to open the house-door with a key she had taken from her\\npocket, and to whom Richard now said that as we had had the pleasure\\nof seeing where she lived, we would leave her, being pressed for\\ntime. But she was not to be so easily left. She became so\\nfantastically and pressingly earnest in her entreaties that we would\\nwalk up and see her apartment for an instant, and was so bent, in her\\nharmless way, on leading me in, as part of the good omen she desired,\\nthat I (whatever the others might do) saw nothing for it but to\\ncomply. I suppose we were all more or less curious; at any rate, when\\nthe old man added his persuasions to hers and said, \"Aye, aye! Please\\nher! It won\\'t take a minute! Come in, come in! Come in through the\\nshop if t\\'other door\\'s out of order!\" we all went in, stimulated by\\nRichard\\'s laughing encouragement and relying on his protection.\\n\\n\"My landlord, Krook,\" said the little old lady, condescending to him\\nfrom her lofty station as she presented him to us. \"He is called\\namong the neighbours the Lord Chancellor. His shop is called the\\nCourt of Chancery. He is a very eccentric person. He is very odd. Oh,\\nI assure you he is very odd!\"\\n\\nShe shook her head a great many times and tapped her forehead with\\nher finger to express to us that we must have the goodness to excuse\\nhim, \"For he is a little--you know--M!\" said the old lady with great\\nstateliness. The old man overheard, and laughed.\\n\\n\"It\\'s true enough,\" he said, going before us with the lantern, \"that\\nthey call me the Lord Chancellor and call my shop Chancery. And why\\ndo you think they call me the Lord Chancellor and my shop Chancery?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, I am sure!\" said Richard rather carelessly.\\n\\n\"You see,\" said the old man, stopping and turning round, \"they--Hi!\\nHere\\'s lovely hair! I have got three sacks of ladies\\' hair below, but\\nnone so beautiful and fine as this. What colour, and what texture!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'ll do, my good friend!\" said Richard, strongly disapproving of\\nhis having drawn one of Ada\\'s tresses through his yellow hand. \"You\\ncan admire as the rest of us do without taking that liberty.\"\\n\\nThe old man darted at him a sudden look which even called my\\nattention from Ada, who, startled and blushing, was so remarkably\\nbeautiful that she seemed to fix the wandering attention of the\\nlittle old lady herself. But as Ada interposed and laughingly said\\nshe could only feel proud of such genuine admiration, Mr. Krook\\nshrunk into his former self as suddenly as he had leaped out of it.\\n\\n\"You see, I have so many things here,\" he resumed, holding up the\\nlantern, \"of so many kinds, and all as the neighbours think (but THEY\\nknow nothing), wasting away and going to rack and ruin, that that\\'s\\nwhy they have given me and my place a christening. And I have so many\\nold parchmentses and papers in my stock. And I have a liking for rust\\nand must and cobwebs. And all\\'s fish that comes to my net. And I\\ncan\\'t abear to part with anything I once lay hold of (or so my\\nneighbours think, but what do THEY know?) or to alter anything, or to\\nhave any sweeping, nor scouring, nor cleaning, nor repairing going on\\nabout me. That\\'s the way I\\'ve got the ill name of Chancery. I don\\'t\\nmind. I go to see my noble and learned brother pretty well every day,\\nwhen he sits in the Inn. He don\\'t notice me, but I notice him.\\nThere\\'s no great odds betwixt us. We both grub on in a muddle. Hi,\\nLady Jane!\"\\n\\nA large grey cat leaped from some neighbouring shelf on his shoulder\\nand startled us all.\\n\\n\"Hi! Show \\'em how you scratch. Hi! Tear, my lady!\" said her master.\\n\\nThe cat leaped down and ripped at a bundle of rags with her tigerish\\nclaws, with a sound that it set my teeth on edge to hear.\\n\\n\"She\\'d do as much for any one I was to set her on,\" said the old man.\\n\"I deal in cat-skins among other general matters, and hers was\\noffered to me. It\\'s a very fine skin, as you may see, but I didn\\'t\\nhave it stripped off! THAT warn\\'t like Chancery practice though, says\\nyou!\"\\n\\nHe had by this time led us across the shop, and now opened a door in\\nthe back part of it, leading to the house-entry. As he stood with his\\nhand upon the lock, the little old lady graciously observed to him\\nbefore passing out, \"That will do, Krook. You mean well, but are\\ntiresome. My young friends are pressed for time. I have none to spare\\nmyself, having to attend court very soon. My young friends are the\\nwards in Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Jarndyce!\" said the old man with a start.\\n\\n\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The great suit, Krook,\" returned his lodger.\\n\\n\"Hi!\" exclaimed the old man in a tone of thoughtful amazement and\\nwith a wider stare than before. \"Think of it!\"\\n\\nHe seemed so rapt all in a moment and looked so curiously at us that\\nRichard said, \"Why, you appear to trouble yourself a good deal about\\nthe causes before your noble and learned brother, the other\\nChancellor!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the old man abstractedly. \"Sure! YOUR name now will be--\"\\n\\n\"Richard Carstone.\"\\n\\n\"Carstone,\" he repeated, slowly checking off that name upon his\\nforefinger; and each of the others he went on to mention upon a\\nseparate finger. \"Yes. There was the name of Barbary, and the name of\\nClare, and the name of Dedlock, too, I think.\"\\n\\n\"He knows as much of the cause as the real salaried Chancellor!\" said\\nRichard, quite astonished, to Ada and me.\\n\\n\"Aye!\" said the old man, coming slowly out of his abstraction. \"Yes!\\nTom Jarndyce--you\\'ll excuse me, being related; but he was never known\\nabout court by any other name, and was as well known there as--she is\\nnow,\" nodding slightly at his lodger. \"Tom Jarndyce was often in\\nhere. He got into a restless habit of strolling about when the cause\\nwas on, or expected, talking to the little shopkeepers and telling\\n\\'em to keep out of Chancery, whatever they did. \\'For,\\' says he, \\'it\\'s\\nbeing ground to bits in a slow mill; it\\'s being roasted at a slow\\nfire; it\\'s being stung to death by single bees; it\\'s being drowned by\\ndrops; it\\'s going mad by grains.\\' He was as near making away with\\nhimself, just where the young lady stands, as near could be.\"\\n\\nWe listened with horror.\\n\\n\"He come in at the door,\" said the old man, slowly pointing an\\nimaginary track along the shop, \"on the day he did it--the whole\\nneighbourhood had said for months before that he would do it, of a\\ncertainty sooner or later--he come in at the door that day, and\\nwalked along there, and sat himself on a bench that stood there, and\\nasked me (you\\'ll judge I was a mortal sight younger then) to fetch\\nhim a pint of wine. \\'For,\\' says he, \\'Krook, I am much depressed; my\\ncause is on again, and I think I\\'m nearer judgment than I ever was.\\'\\nI hadn\\'t a mind to leave him alone; and I persuaded him to go to the\\ntavern over the way there, t\\'other side my lane (I mean Chancery\\nLane); and I followed and looked in at the window, and saw him,\\ncomfortable as I thought, in the arm-chair by the fire, and company\\nwith him. I hadn\\'t hardly got back here when I heard a shot go\\nechoing and rattling right away into the inn. I ran out--neighbours\\nran out--twenty of us cried at once, \\'Tom Jarndyce!\\'\"\\n\\nThe old man stopped, looked hard at us, looked down into the lantern,\\nblew the light out, and shut the lantern up.\\n\\n\"We were right, I needn\\'t tell the present hearers. Hi! To be sure,\\nhow the neighbourhood poured into court that afternoon while the\\ncause was on! How my noble and learned brother, and all the rest of\\n\\'em, grubbed and muddled away as usual and tried to look as if they\\nhadn\\'t heard a word of the last fact in the case or as if they\\nhad--Oh, dear me!--nothing at all to do with it if they had heard of\\nit by any chance!\"\\n\\nAda\\'s colour had entirely left her, and Richard was scarcely less\\npale. Nor could I wonder, judging even from my emotions, and I was no\\nparty in the suit, that to hearts so untried and fresh it was a shock\\nto come into the inheritance of a protracted misery, attended in the\\nminds of many people with such dreadful recollections. I had another\\nuneasiness, in the application of the painful story to the poor\\nhalf-witted creature who had brought us there; but, to my surprise,\\nshe seemed perfectly unconscious of that and only led the way\\nupstairs again, informing us with the toleration of a superior\\ncreature for the infirmities of a common mortal that her landlord was\\n\"a little M, you know!\"\\n\\nShe lived at the top of the house, in a pretty large room, from which\\nshe had a glimpse of Lincoln\\'s Inn Hall. This seemed to have been her\\nprincipal inducement, originally, for taking up her residence there.\\nShe could look at it, she said, in the night, especially in the\\nmoonshine. Her room was clean, but very, very bare. I noticed the\\nscantiest necessaries in the way of furniture; a few old prints from\\nbooks, of Chancellors and barristers, wafered against the wall; and\\nsome half-dozen reticles and work-bags, \"containing documents,\" as\\nshe informed us. There were neither coals nor ashes in the grate, and\\nI saw no articles of clothing anywhere, nor any kind of food. Upon a\\nshelf in an open cupboard were a plate or two, a cup or two, and so\\nforth, but all dry and empty. There was a more affecting meaning in\\nher pinched appearance, I thought as I looked round, than I had\\nunderstood before.\\n\\n\"Extremely honoured, I am sure,\" said our poor hostess with the\\ngreatest suavity, \"by this visit from the wards in Jarndyce. And very\\nmuch indebted for the omen. It is a retired situation. Considering. I\\nam limited as to situation. In consequence of the necessity of\\nattending on the Chancellor. I have lived here many years. I pass my\\ndays in court, my evenings and my nights here. I find the nights\\nlong, for I sleep but little and think much. That is, of course,\\nunavoidable, being in Chancery. I am sorry I cannot offer chocolate.\\nI expect a judgment shortly and shall then place my establishment on\\na superior footing. At present, I don\\'t mind confessing to the wards\\nin Jarndyce (in strict confidence) that I sometimes find it difficult\\nto keep up a genteel appearance. I have felt the cold here. I have\\nfelt something sharper than cold. It matters very little. Pray excuse\\nthe introduction of such mean topics.\"\\n\\nShe partly drew aside the curtain of the long, low garret window and\\ncalled our attention to a number of bird-cages hanging there, some\\ncontaining several birds. There were larks, linnets, and\\ngoldfinches--I should think at least twenty.\\n\\n\"I began to keep the little creatures,\" she said, \"with an object\\nthat the wards will readily comprehend. With the intention of\\nrestoring them to liberty. When my judgment should be given. Ye-es!\\nThey die in prison, though. Their lives, poor silly things, are so\\nshort in comparison with Chancery proceedings that, one by one, the\\nwhole collection has died over and over again. I doubt, do you know,\\nwhether one of these, though they are all young, will live to be\\nfree! Ve-ry mortifying, is it not?\"\\n\\nAlthough she sometimes asked a question, she never seemed to expect a\\nreply, but rambled on as if she were in the habit of doing so when no\\none but herself was present.\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" she pursued, \"I positively doubt sometimes, I do assure\\nyou, whether while matters are still unsettled, and the sixth or\\nGreat Seal still prevails, I may not one day be found lying stark and\\nsenseless here, as I have found so many birds!\"\\n\\nRichard, answering what he saw in Ada\\'s compassionate eyes, took the\\nopportunity of laying some money, softly and unobserved, on the\\nchimney-piece. We all drew nearer to the cages, feigning to examine\\nthe birds.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t allow them to sing much,\" said the little old lady, \"for\\n(you\\'ll think this curious) I find my mind confused by the idea that\\nthey are singing while I am following the arguments in court. And my\\nmind requires to be so very clear, you know! Another time, I\\'ll tell\\nyou their names. Not at present. On a day of such good omen, they\\nshall sing as much as they like. In honour of youth,\" a smile and\\ncurtsy, \"hope,\" a smile and curtsy, \"and beauty,\" a smile and curtsy.\\n\"There! We\\'ll let in the full light.\"\\n\\nThe birds began to stir and chirp.\\n\\n\"I cannot admit the air freely,\" said the little old lady--the room\\nwas close, and would have been the better for it--\"because the cat\\nyou saw downstairs, called Lady Jane, is greedy for their lives. She\\ncrouches on the parapet outside for hours and hours. I have\\ndiscovered,\" whispering mysteriously, \"that her natural cruelty is\\nsharpened by a jealous fear of their regaining their liberty. In\\nconsequence of the judgment I expect being shortly given. She is sly\\nand full of malice. I half believe, sometimes, that she is no cat,\\nbut the wolf of the old saying. It is so very difficult to keep her\\nfrom the door.\"\\n\\nSome neighbouring bells, reminding the poor soul that it was\\nhalf-past nine, did more for us in the way of bringing our visit to\\nan end than we could easily have done for ourselves. She hurriedly\\ntook up her little bag of documents, which she had laid upon the\\ntable on coming in, and asked if we were also going into court. On\\nour answering no, and that we would on no account detain her, she\\nopened the door to attend us downstairs.\\n\\n\"With such an omen, it is even more necessary than usual that I\\nshould be there before the Chancellor comes in,\" said she, \"for he\\nmight mention my case the first thing. I have a presentiment that he\\nWILL mention it the first thing this morning.\"\\n\\nShe stopped to tell us in a whisper as we were going down that the\\nwhole house was filled with strange lumber which her landlord had\\nbought piecemeal and had no wish to sell, in consequence of being a\\nlittle M. This was on the first floor. But she had made a previous\\nstoppage on the second floor and had silently pointed at a dark door\\nthere.\\n\\n\"The only other lodger,\" she now whispered in explanation, \"a\\nlaw-writer. The children in the lanes here say he has sold himself to\\nthe devil. I don\\'t know what he can have done with the money. Hush!\"\\n\\nShe appeared to mistrust that the lodger might hear her even there,\\nand repeating \"Hush!\" went before us on tiptoe as though even the\\nsound of her footsteps might reveal to him what she had said.\\n\\nPassing through the shop on our way out, as we had passed through it\\non our way in, we found the old man storing a quantity of packets of\\nwaste-paper in a kind of well in the floor. He seemed to be working\\nhard, with the perspiration standing on his forehead, and had a piece\\nof chalk by him, with which, as he put each separate package or\\nbundle down, he made a crooked mark on the panelling of the wall.\\n\\nRichard and Ada, and Miss Jellyby, and the little old lady had gone\\nby him, and I was going when he touched me on the arm to stay me, and\\nchalked the letter J upon the wall--in a very curious manner,\\nbeginning with the end of the letter and shaping it backward. It was\\na capital letter, not a printed one, but just such a letter as any\\nclerk in Messrs. Kenge and Carboy\\'s office would have made.\\n\\n\"Can you read it?\" he asked me with a keen glance.\\n\\n\"Surely,\" said I. \"It\\'s very plain.\"\\n\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\\n\"J.\"\\n\\nWith another glance at me, and a glance at the door, he rubbed it out\\nand turned an \"a\" in its place (not a capital letter this time), and\\nsaid, \"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\nI told him. He then rubbed that out and turned the letter \"r,\" and\\nasked me the same question. He went on quickly until he had formed in\\nthe same curious manner, beginning at the ends and bottoms of the\\nletters, the word Jarndyce, without once leaving two letters on the\\nwall together.\\n\\n\"What does that spell?\" he asked me.\\n\\nWhen I told him, he laughed. In the same odd way, yet with the same\\nrapidity, he then produced singly, and rubbed out singly, the letters\\nforming the words Bleak House. These, in some astonishment, I also\\nread; and he laughed again.\\n\\n\"Hi!\" said the old man, laying aside the chalk. \"I have a turn for\\ncopying from memory, you see, miss, though I can neither read nor\\nwrite.\"\\n\\nHe looked so disagreeable and his cat looked so wickedly at me, as if\\nI were a blood-relation of the birds upstairs, that I was quite\\nrelieved by Richard\\'s appearing at the door and saying, \"Miss\\nSummerson, I hope you are not bargaining for the sale of your hair.\\nDon\\'t be tempted. Three sacks below are quite enough for Mr. Krook!\"\\n\\nI lost no time in wishing Mr. Krook good morning and joining my\\nfriends outside, where we parted with the little old lady, who gave\\nus her blessing with great ceremony and renewed her assurance of\\nyesterday in reference to her intention of settling estates on Ada\\nand me. Before we finally turned out of those lanes, we looked back\\nand saw Mr. Krook standing at his shop-door, in his spectacles,\\nlooking after us, with his cat upon his shoulder, and her tail\\nsticking up on one side of his hairy cap like a tall feather.\\n\\n\"Quite an adventure for a morning in London!\" said Richard with a\\nsigh. \"Ah, cousin, cousin, it\\'s a weary word this Chancery!\"\\n\\n\"It is to me, and has been ever since I can remember,\" returned Ada.\\n\"I am grieved that I should be the enemy--as I suppose I am--of a\\ngreat number of relations and others, and that they should be my\\nenemies--as I suppose they are--and that we should all be ruining one\\nanother without knowing how or why and be in constant doubt and\\ndiscord all our lives. It seems very strange, as there must be right\\nsomewhere, that an honest judge in real earnest has not been able to\\nfind out through all these years where it is.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, cousin!\" said Richard. \"Strange, indeed! All this wasteful,\\nwanton chess-playing IS very strange. To see that composed court\\nyesterday jogging on so serenely and to think of the wretchedness of\\nthe pieces on the board gave me the headache and the heartache both\\ntogether. My head ached with wondering how it happened, if men were\\nneither fools nor rascals; and my heart ached to think they could\\npossibly be either. But at all events, Ada--I may call you Ada?\"\\n\\n\"Of course you may, cousin Richard.\"\\n\\n\"At all events, Chancery will work none of its bad influences on US.\\nWe have happily been brought together, thanks to our good kinsman,\\nand it can\\'t divide us now!\"\\n\\n\"Never, I hope, cousin Richard!\" said Ada gently.\\n\\nMiss Jellyby gave my arm a squeeze and me a very significant look. I\\nsmiled in return, and we made the rest of the way back very\\npleasantly.\\n\\nIn half an hour after our arrival, Mrs. Jellyby appeared; and in the\\ncourse of an hour the various things necessary for breakfast\\nstraggled one by one into the dining-room. I do not doubt that Mrs.\\nJellyby had gone to bed and got up in the usual manner, but she\\npresented no appearance of having changed her dress. She was greatly\\noccupied during breakfast, for the morning\\'s post brought a heavy\\ncorrespondence relative to Borrioboola-Gha, which would occasion her\\n(she said) to pass a busy day. The children tumbled about, and\\nnotched memoranda of their accidents in their legs, which were\\nperfect little calendars of distress; and Peepy was lost for an hour\\nand a half, and brought home from Newgate market by a policeman. The\\nequable manner in which Mrs. Jellyby sustained both his absence and\\nhis restoration to the family circle surprised us all.\\n\\nShe was by that time perseveringly dictating to Caddy, and Caddy was\\nfast relapsing into the inky condition in which we had found her. At\\none o\\'clock an open carriage arrived for us, and a cart for our\\nluggage. Mrs. Jellyby charged us with many remembrances to her good\\nfriend Mr. Jarndyce; Caddy left her desk to see us depart, kissed me\\nin the passage, and stood biting her pen and sobbing on the steps;\\nPeepy, I am happy to say, was asleep and spared the pain of\\nseparation (I was not without misgivings that he had gone to Newgate\\nmarket in search of me); and all the other children got up behind the\\nbarouche and fell off, and we saw them, with great concern, scattered\\nover the surface of Thavies Inn as we rolled out of its precincts.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe day had brightened very much, and still brightened as we went\\nwestward. We went our way through the sunshine and the fresh air,\\nwondering more and more at the extent of the streets, the brilliancy\\nof the shops, the great traffic, and the crowds of people whom the\\npleasanter weather seemed to have brought out like many-coloured\\nflowers. By and by we began to leave the wonderful city and to\\nproceed through suburbs which, of themselves, would have made a\\npretty large town in my eyes; and at last we got into a real country\\nroad again, with windmills, rick-yards, milestones, farmers\\' waggons,\\nscents of old hay, swinging signs, and horse troughs: trees, fields,\\nand hedge-rows. It was delightful to see the green landscape before\\nus and the immense metropolis behind; and when a waggon with a train\\nof beautiful horses, furnished with red trappings and clear-sounding\\nbells, came by us with its music, I believe we could all three have\\nsung to the bells, so cheerful were the influences around.\\n\\n\"The whole road has been reminding me of my namesake Whittington,\"\\nsaid Richard, \"and that waggon is the finishing touch. Halloa! What\\'s\\nthe matter?\"\\n\\nWe had stopped, and the waggon had stopped too. Its music changed as\\nthe horses came to a stand, and subsided to a gentle tinkling, except\\nwhen a horse tossed his head or shook himself and sprinkled off a\\nlittle shower of bell-ringing.\\n\\n\"Our postilion is looking after the waggoner,\" said Richard, \"and the\\nwaggoner is coming back after us. Good day, friend!\" The waggoner was\\nat our coach-door. \"Why, here\\'s an extraordinary thing!\" added\\nRichard, looking closely at the man. \"He has got your name, Ada, in\\nhis hat!\"\\n\\nHe had all our names in his hat. Tucked within the band were three\\nsmall notes--one addressed to Ada, one to Richard, one to me. These\\nthe waggoner delivered to each of us respectively, reading the name\\naloud first. In answer to Richard\\'s inquiry from whom they came, he\\nbriefly answered, \"Master, sir, if you please\"; and putting on his\\nhat again (which was like a soft bowl), cracked his whip, re-awakened\\nhis music, and went melodiously away.\\n\\n\"Is that Mr. Jarndyce\\'s waggon?\" said Richard, calling to our\\npost-boy.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" he replied. \"Going to London.\"\\n\\nWe opened the notes. Each was a counterpart of the other and\\ncontained these words in a solid, plain hand.\\n\\n\\n   I look forward, my dear, to our meeting easily and\\n   without constraint on either side. I therefore have to\\n   propose that we meet as old friends and take the past for\\n   granted. It will be a relief to you possibly, and to me\\n   certainly, and so my love to you.\\n\\n   John Jarndyce\\n\\n\\nI had perhaps less reason to be surprised than either of my\\ncompanions, having never yet enjoyed an opportunity of thanking one\\nwho had been my benefactor and sole earthly dependence through so\\nmany years. I had not considered how I could thank him, my gratitude\\nlying too deep in my heart for that; but I now began to consider how\\nI could meet him without thanking him, and felt it would be very\\ndifficult indeed.\\n\\nThe notes revived in Richard and Ada a general impression that they\\nboth had, without quite knowing how they came by it, that their\\ncousin Jarndyce could never bear acknowledgments for any kindness he\\nperformed and that sooner than receive any he would resort to the\\nmost singular expedients and evasions or would even run away. Ada\\ndimly remembered to have heard her mother tell, when she was a very\\nlittle child, that he had once done her an act of uncommon generosity\\nand that on her going to his house to thank him, he happened to see\\nher through a window coming to the door, and immediately escaped by\\nthe back gate, and was not heard of for three months. This discourse\\nled to a great deal more on the same theme, and indeed it lasted us\\nall day, and we talked of scarcely anything else. If we did by any\\nchance diverge into another subject, we soon returned to this, and\\nwondered what the house would be like, and when we should get there,\\nand whether we should see Mr. Jarndyce as soon as we arrived or after\\na delay, and what he would say to us, and what we should say to him.\\nAll of which we wondered about, over and over again.\\n\\nThe roads were very heavy for the horses, but the pathway was\\ngenerally good, so we alighted and walked up all the hills, and liked\\nit so well that we prolonged our walk on the level ground when we got\\nto the top. At Barnet there were other horses waiting for us, but as\\nthey had only just been fed, we had to wait for them too, and got a\\nlong fresh walk over a common and an old battle-field before the\\ncarriage came up. These delays so protracted the journey that the\\nshort day was spent and the long night had closed in before we came\\nto St. Albans, near to which town Bleak House was, we knew.\\n\\nBy that time we were so anxious and nervous that even Richard\\nconfessed, as we rattled over the stones of the old street, to\\nfeeling an irrational desire to drive back again. As to Ada and me,\\nwhom he had wrapped up with great care, the night being sharp and\\nfrosty, we trembled from head to foot. When we turned out of the\\ntown, round a corner, and Richard told us that the post-boy, who had\\nfor a long time sympathized with our heightened expectation, was\\nlooking back and nodding, we both stood up in the carriage (Richard\\nholding Ada lest she should be jolted down) and gazed round upon the\\nopen country and the starlight night for our destination. There was a\\nlight sparkling on the top of a hill before us, and the driver,\\npointing to it with his whip and crying, \"That\\'s Bleak House!\" put\\nhis horses into a canter and took us forward at such a rate, uphill\\nthough it was, that the wheels sent the road drift flying about our\\nheads like spray from a water-mill. Presently we lost the light,\\npresently saw it, presently lost it, presently saw it, and turned\\ninto an avenue of trees and cantered up towards where it was beaming\\nbrightly. It was in a window of what seemed to be an old-fashioned\\nhouse with three peaks in the roof in front and a circular sweep\\nleading to the porch. A bell was rung as we drew up, and amidst the\\nsound of its deep voice in the still air, and the distant barking of\\nsome dogs, and a gush of light from the opened door, and the smoking\\nand steaming of the heated horses, and the quickened beating of our\\nown hearts, we alighted in no inconsiderable confusion.\\n\\n\"Ada, my love, Esther, my dear, you are welcome. I rejoice to see\\nyou! Rick, if I had a hand to spare at present, I would give it you!\"\\n\\nThe gentleman who said these words in a clear, bright, hospitable\\nvoice had one of his arms round Ada\\'s waist and the other round mine,\\nand kissed us both in a fatherly way, and bore us across the hall\\ninto a ruddy little room, all in a glow with a blazing fire. Here he\\nkissed us again, and opening his arms, made us sit down side by side\\non a sofa ready drawn out near the hearth. I felt that if we had been\\nat all demonstrative, he would have run away in a moment.\\n\\n\"Now, Rick!\" said he. \"I have a hand at liberty. A word in earnest is\\nas good as a speech. I am heartily glad to see you. You are at home.\\nWarm yourself!\"\\n\\nRichard shook him by both hands with an intuitive mixture of respect\\nand frankness, and only saying (though with an earnestness that\\nrather alarmed me, I was so afraid of Mr. Jarndyce\\'s suddenly\\ndisappearing), \"You are very kind, sir! We are very much obliged to\\nyou!\" laid aside his hat and coat and came up to the fire.\\n\\n\"And how did you like the ride? And how did you like Mrs. Jellyby, my\\ndear?\" said Mr. Jarndyce to Ada.\\n\\nWhile Ada was speaking to him in reply, I glanced (I need not say\\nwith how much interest) at his face. It was a handsome, lively, quick\\nface, full of change and motion; and his hair was a silvered\\niron-grey. I took him to be nearer sixty than fifty, but he was\\nupright, hearty, and robust. From the moment of his first speaking to\\nus his voice had connected itself with an association in my mind that\\nI could not define; but now, all at once, a something sudden in his\\nmanner and a pleasant expression in his eyes recalled the gentleman\\nin the stagecoach six years ago on the memorable day of my journey to\\nReading. I was certain it was he. I never was so frightened in my\\nlife as when I made the discovery, for he caught my glance, and\\nappearing to read my thoughts, gave such a look at the door that I\\nthought we had lost him.\\n\\nHowever, I am happy to say he remained where he was, and asked me\\nwhat I thought of Mrs. Jellyby.\\n\\n\"She exerts herself very much for Africa, sir,\" I said.\\n\\n\"Nobly!\" returned Mr. Jarndyce. \"But you answer like Ada.\" Whom I had\\nnot heard. \"You all think something else, I see.\"\\n\\n\"We rather thought,\" said I, glancing at Richard and Ada, who\\nentreated me with their eyes to speak, \"that perhaps she was a little\\nunmindful of her home.\"\\n\\n\"Floored!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\nI was rather alarmed again.\\n\\n\"Well! I want to know your real thoughts, my dear. I may have sent\\nyou there on purpose.\"\\n\\n\"We thought that, perhaps,\" said I, hesitating, \"it is right to begin\\nwith the obligations of home, sir; and that, perhaps, while those are\\noverlooked and neglected, no other duties can possibly be substituted\\nfor them.\"\\n\\n\"The little Jellybys,\" said Richard, coming to my relief, \"are\\nreally--I can\\'t help expressing myself strongly, sir--in a devil of a\\nstate.\"\\n\\n\"She means well,\" said Mr. Jarndyce hastily. \"The wind\\'s in the\\neast.\"\\n\\n\"It was in the north, sir, as we came down,\" observed Richard.\\n\\n\"My dear Rick,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, poking the fire, \"I\\'ll take an\\noath it\\'s either in the east or going to be. I am always conscious of\\nan uncomfortable sensation now and then when the wind is blowing in\\nthe east.\"\\n\\n\"Rheumatism, sir?\" said Richard.\\n\\n\"I dare say it is, Rick. I believe it is. And so the little Jell--I\\nhad my doubts about \\'em--are in a--oh, Lord, yes, it\\'s easterly!\"\\nsaid Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\nHe had taken two or three undecided turns up and down while uttering\\nthese broken sentences, retaining the poker in one hand and rubbing\\nhis hair with the other, with a good-natured vexation at once so\\nwhimsical and so lovable that I am sure we were more delighted with\\nhim than we could possibly have expressed in any words. He gave an\\narm to Ada and an arm to me, and bidding Richard bring a candle, was\\nleading the way out when he suddenly turned us all back again.\\n\\n\"Those little Jellybys. Couldn\\'t you--didn\\'t you--now, if it had\\nrained sugar-plums, or three-cornered raspberry tarts, or anything of\\nthat sort!\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Oh, cousin--\" Ada hastily began.\\n\\n\"Good, my pretty pet. I like cousin. Cousin John, perhaps, is\\nbetter.\"\\n\\n\"Then, cousin John--\" Ada laughingly began again.\\n\\n\"Ha, ha! Very good indeed!\" said Mr. Jarndyce with great enjoyment.\\n\"Sounds uncommonly natural. Yes, my dear?\"\\n\\n\"It did better than that. It rained Esther.\"\\n\\n\"Aye?\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"What did Esther do?\"\\n\\n\"Why, cousin John,\" said Ada, clasping her hands upon his arm and\\nshaking her head at me across him--for I wanted her to be\\nquiet--\"Esther was their friend directly. Esther nursed them, coaxed\\nthem to sleep, washed and dressed them, told them stories, kept them\\nquiet, bought them keepsakes\"--My dear girl! I had only gone out with\\nPeepy after he was found and given him a little, tiny horse!--\"and,\\ncousin John, she softened poor Caroline, the eldest one, so much and\\nwas so thoughtful for me and so amiable! No, no, I won\\'t be\\ncontradicted, Esther dear! You know, you know, it\\'s true!\"\\n\\nThe warm-hearted darling leaned across her cousin John and kissed me,\\nand then looking up in his face, boldly said, \"At all events, cousin\\nJohn, I WILL thank you for the companion you have given me.\" I felt\\nas if she challenged him to run away. But he didn\\'t.\\n\\n\"Where did you say the wind was, Rick?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"In the north as we came down, sir.\"\\n\\n\"You are right. There\\'s no east in it. A mistake of mine. Come,\\ngirls, come and see your home!\"\\n\\nIt was one of those delightfully irregular houses where you go up and\\ndown steps out of one room into another, and where you come upon more\\nrooms when you think you have seen all there are, and where there is\\na bountiful provision of little halls and passages, and where you\\nfind still older cottage-rooms in unexpected places with lattice\\nwindows and green growth pressing through them. Mine, which we\\nentered first, was of this kind, with an up-and-down roof that had\\nmore corners in it than I ever counted afterwards and a chimney\\n(there was a wood fire on the hearth) paved all around with pure\\nwhite tiles, in every one of which a bright miniature of the fire was\\nblazing. Out of this room, you went down two steps into a charming\\nlittle sitting-room looking down upon a flower-garden, which room was\\nhenceforth to belong to Ada and me. Out of this you went up three\\nsteps into Ada\\'s bedroom, which had a fine broad window commanding a\\nbeautiful view (we saw a great expanse of darkness lying underneath\\nthe stars), to which there was a hollow window-seat, in which, with a\\nspring-lock, three dear Adas might have been lost at once. Out of\\nthis room you passed into a little gallery, with which the other best\\nrooms (only two) communicated, and so, by a little staircase of\\nshallow steps with a number of corner stairs in it, considering its\\nlength, down into the hall. But if instead of going out at Ada\\'s door\\nyou came back into my room, and went out at the door by which you had\\nentered it, and turned up a few crooked steps that branched off in an\\nunexpected manner from the stairs, you lost yourself in passages,\\nwith mangles in them, and three-cornered tables, and a native Hindu\\nchair, which was also a sofa, a box, and a bedstead, and looked in\\nevery form something between a bamboo skeleton and a great bird-cage,\\nand had been brought from India nobody knew by whom or when. From\\nthese you came on Richard\\'s room, which was part library, part\\nsitting-room, part bedroom, and seemed indeed a comfortable compound\\nof many rooms. Out of that you went straight, with a little interval\\nof passage, to the plain room where Mr. Jarndyce slept, all the year\\nround, with his window open, his bedstead without any furniture\\nstanding in the middle of the floor for more air, and his cold bath\\ngaping for him in a smaller room adjoining. Out of that you came into\\nanother passage, where there were back-stairs and where you could\\nhear the horses being rubbed down outside the stable and being told\\nto \"Hold up\" and \"Get over,\" as they slipped about very much on the\\nuneven stones. Or you might, if you came out at another door (every\\nroom had at least two doors), go straight down to the hall again by\\nhalf-a-dozen steps and a low archway, wondering how you got back\\nthere or had ever got out of it.\\n\\nThe furniture, old-fashioned rather than old, like the house, was as\\npleasantly irregular. Ada\\'s sleeping-room was all flowers--in chintz\\nand paper, in velvet, in needlework, in the brocade of two stiff\\ncourtly chairs which stood, each attended by a little page of a stool\\nfor greater state, on either side of the fire-place. Our sitting-room\\nwas green and had framed and glazed upon the walls numbers of\\nsurprising and surprised birds, staring out of pictures at a real\\ntrout in a case, as brown and shining as if it had been served with\\ngravy; at the death of Captain Cook; and at the whole process of\\npreparing tea in China, as depicted by Chinese artists. In my room\\nthere were oval engravings of the months--ladies haymaking in short\\nwaists and large hats tied under the chin, for June; smooth-legged\\nnoblemen pointing with cocked-hats to village steeples, for October.\\nHalf-length portraits in crayons abounded all through the house, but\\nwere so dispersed that I found the brother of a youthful officer of\\nmine in the china-closet and the grey old age of my pretty young\\nbride, with a flower in her bodice, in the breakfast-room. As\\nsubstitutes, I had four angels, of Queen Anne\\'s reign, taking a\\ncomplacent gentleman to heaven, in festoons, with some difficulty;\\nand a composition in needlework representing fruit, a kettle, and an\\nalphabet. All the movables, from the wardrobes to the chairs and\\ntables, hangings, glasses, even to the pincushions and scent-bottles\\non the dressing-tables, displayed the same quaint variety. They\\nagreed in nothing but their perfect neatness, their display of the\\nwhitest linen, and their storing-up, wheresoever the existence of a\\ndrawer, small or large, rendered it possible, of quantities of\\nrose-leaves and sweet lavender. Such, with its illuminated windows,\\nsoftened here and there by shadows of curtains, shining out upon the\\nstarlight night; with its light, and warmth, and comfort; with its\\nhospitable jingle, at a distance, of preparations for dinner; with\\nthe face of its generous master brightening everything we saw; and\\njust wind enough without to sound a low accompaniment to everything\\nwe heard, were our first impressions of Bleak House.\\n\\n\"I am glad you like it,\" said Mr. Jarndyce when he had brought us\\nround again to Ada\\'s sitting-room. \"It makes no pretensions, but it\\nis a comfortable little place, I hope, and will be more so with such\\nbright young looks in it. You have barely half an hour before dinner.\\nThere\\'s no one here but the finest creature upon earth--a child.\"\\n\\n\"More children, Esther!\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mean literally a child,\" pursued Mr. Jarndyce; \"not a child\\nin years. He is grown up--he is at least as old as I am--but in\\nsimplicity, and freshness, and enthusiasm, and a fine guileless\\ninaptitude for all worldly affairs, he is a perfect child.\"\\n\\nWe felt that he must be very interesting.\\n\\n\"He knows Mrs. Jellyby,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"He is a musical man, an\\namateur, but might have been a professional. He is an artist too, an\\namateur, but might have been a professional. He is a man of\\nattainments and of captivating manners. He has been unfortunate in\\nhis affairs, and unfortunate in his pursuits, and unfortunate in his\\nfamily; but he don\\'t care--he\\'s a child!\"\\n\\n\"Did you imply that he has children of his own, sir?\" inquired\\nRichard.\\n\\n\"Yes, Rick! Half-a-dozen. More! Nearer a dozen, I should think. But\\nhe has never looked after them. How could he? He wanted somebody to\\nlook after HIM. He is a child, you know!\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"And have the children looked after themselves at all, sir?\" inquired\\nRichard.\\n\\n\"Why, just as you may suppose,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, his countenance\\nsuddenly falling. \"It is said that the children of the very poor are\\nnot brought up, but dragged up. Harold Skimpole\\'s children have\\ntumbled up somehow or other. The wind\\'s getting round again, I am\\nafraid. I feel it rather!\"\\n\\nRichard observed that the situation was exposed on a sharp night.\\n\\n\"It IS exposed,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"No doubt that\\'s the cause. Bleak\\nHouse has an exposed sound. But you are coming my way. Come along!\"\\n\\nOur luggage having arrived and being all at hand, I was dressed in a\\nfew minutes and engaged in putting my worldly goods away when a maid\\n(not the one in attendance upon Ada, but another, whom I had not\\nseen) brought a basket into my room with two bunches of keys in it,\\nall labelled.\\n\\n\"For you, miss, if you please,\" said she.\\n\\n\"For me?\" said I.\\n\\n\"The housekeeping keys, miss.\"\\n\\nI showed my surprise, for she added with some little surprise on her\\nown part, \"I was told to bring them as soon as you was alone, miss.\\nMiss Summerson, if I don\\'t deceive myself?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"That is my name.\"\\n\\n\"The large bunch is the housekeeping, and the little bunch is the\\ncellars, miss. Any time you was pleased to appoint to-morrow morning,\\nI was to show you the presses and things they belong to.\"\\n\\nI said I would be ready at half-past six, and after she was gone,\\nstood looking at the basket, quite lost in the magnitude of my trust.\\nAda found me thus and had such a delightful confidence in me when I\\nshowed her the keys and told her about them that it would have been\\ninsensibility and ingratitude not to feel encouraged. I knew, to be\\nsure, that it was the dear girl\\'s kindness, but I liked to be so\\npleasantly cheated.\\n\\nWhen we went downstairs, we were presented to Mr. Skimpole, who was\\nstanding before the fire telling Richard how fond he used to be, in\\nhis school-time, of football. He was a little bright creature with a\\nrather large head, but a delicate face and a sweet voice, and there\\nwas a perfect charm in him. All he said was so free from effort and\\nspontaneous and was said with such a captivating gaiety that it was\\nfascinating to hear him talk. Being of a more slender figure than Mr.\\nJarndyce and having a richer complexion, with browner hair, he looked\\nyounger. Indeed, he had more the appearance in all respects of a\\ndamaged young man than a well-preserved elderly one. There was an\\neasy negligence in his manner and even in his dress (his hair\\ncarelessly disposed, and his neck-kerchief loose and flowing, as I\\nhave seen artists paint their own portraits) which I could not\\nseparate from the idea of a romantic youth who had undergone some\\nunique process of depreciation. It struck me as being not at all like\\nthe manner or appearance of a man who had advanced in life by the\\nusual road of years, cares, and experiences.\\n\\nI gathered from the conversation that Mr. Skimpole had been educated\\nfor the medical profession and had once lived, in his professional\\ncapacity, in the household of a German prince. He told us, however,\\nthat as he had always been a mere child in point of weights and\\nmeasures and had never known anything about them (except that they\\ndisgusted him), he had never been able to prescribe with the\\nrequisite accuracy of detail. In fact, he said, he had no head for\\ndetail. And he told us, with great humour, that when he was wanted to\\nbleed the prince or physic any of his people, he was generally found\\nlying on his back in bed, reading the newspapers or making\\nfancy-sketches in pencil, and couldn\\'t come. The prince, at last,\\nobjecting to this, \"in which,\" said Mr. Skimpole, in the frankest\\nmanner, \"he was perfectly right,\" the engagement terminated, and Mr.\\nSkimpole having (as he added with delightful gaiety) \"nothing to live\\nupon but love, fell in love, and married, and surrounded himself with\\nrosy cheeks.\" His good friend Jarndyce and some other of his good\\nfriends then helped him, in quicker or slower succession, to several\\nopenings in life, but to no purpose, for he must confess to two of\\nthe oldest infirmities in the world: one was that he had no idea of\\ntime, the other that he had no idea of money. In consequence of which\\nhe never kept an appointment, never could transact any business, and\\nnever knew the value of anything! Well! So he had got on in life, and\\nhere he was! He was very fond of reading the papers, very fond of\\nmaking fancy-sketches with a pencil, very fond of nature, very fond\\nof art. All he asked of society was to let him live. THAT wasn\\'t\\nmuch. His wants were few. Give him the papers, conversation, music,\\nmutton, coffee, landscape, fruit in the season, a few sheets of\\nBristol-board, and a little claret, and he asked no more. He was a\\nmere child in the world, but he didn\\'t cry for the moon. He said to\\nthe world, \"Go your several ways in peace! Wear red coats, blue\\ncoats, lawn sleeves; put pens behind your ears, wear aprons; go after\\nglory, holiness, commerce, trade, any object you prefer; only--let\\nHarold Skimpole live!\"\\n\\nAll this and a great deal more he told us, not only with the\\nutmost brilliancy and enjoyment, but with a certain vivacious\\ncandour--speaking of himself as if he were not at all his own affair,\\nas if Skimpole were a third person, as if he knew that Skimpole had\\nhis singularities but still had his claims too, which were the\\ngeneral business of the community and must not be slighted. He was\\nquite enchanting. If I felt at all confused at that early time in\\nendeavouring to reconcile anything he said with anything I had\\nthought about the duties and accountabilities of life (which I am far\\nfrom sure of), I was confused by not exactly understanding why he was\\nfree of them. That he WAS free of them, I scarcely doubted; he was so\\nvery clear about it himself.\\n\\n\"I covet nothing,\" said Mr. Skimpole in the same light way.\\n\"Possession is nothing to me. Here is my friend Jarndyce\\'s excellent\\nhouse. I feel obliged to him for possessing it. I can sketch it and\\nalter it. I can set it to music. When I am here, I have sufficient\\npossession of it and have neither trouble, cost, nor responsibility.\\nMy steward\\'s name, in short, is Jarndyce, and he can\\'t cheat me. We\\nhave been mentioning Mrs. Jellyby. There is a bright-eyed woman, of a\\nstrong will and immense power of business detail, who throws herself\\ninto objects with surprising ardour! I don\\'t regret that I have not a\\nstrong will and an immense power of business detail to throw myself\\ninto objects with surprising ardour. I can admire her without envy. I\\ncan sympathize with the objects. I can dream of them. I can lie down\\non the grass--in fine weather--and float along an African river,\\nembracing all the natives I meet, as sensible of the deep silence and\\nsketching the dense overhanging tropical growth as accurately as if I\\nwere there. I don\\'t know that it\\'s of any direct use my doing so, but\\nit\\'s all I can do, and I do it thoroughly. Then, for heaven\\'s sake,\\nhaving Harold Skimpole, a confiding child, petitioning you, the\\nworld, an agglomeration of practical people of business habits, to\\nlet him live and admire the human family, do it somehow or other,\\nlike good souls, and suffer him to ride his rocking-horse!\"\\n\\nIt was plain enough that Mr. Jarndyce had not been neglectful of the\\nadjuration. Mr. Skimpole\\'s general position there would have rendered\\nit so without the addition of what he presently said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s only you, the generous creatures, whom I envy,\" said Mr.\\nSkimpole, addressing us, his new friends, in an impersonal manner. \"I\\nenvy you your power of doing what you do. It is what I should revel\\nin myself. I don\\'t feel any vulgar gratitude to you. I almost feel as\\nif YOU ought to be grateful to ME for giving you the opportunity of\\nenjoying the luxury of generosity. I know you like it. For anything I\\ncan tell, I may have come into the world expressly for the purpose of\\nincreasing your stock of happiness. I may have been born to be a\\nbenefactor to you by sometimes giving you an opportunity of assisting\\nme in my little perplexities. Why should I regret my incapacity for\\ndetails and worldly affairs when it leads to such pleasant\\nconsequences? I don\\'t regret it therefore.\"\\n\\nOf all his playful speeches (playful, yet always fully meaning what\\nthey expressed) none seemed to be more to the taste of Mr. Jarndyce\\nthan this. I had often new temptations, afterwards, to wonder whether\\nit was really singular, or only singular to me, that he, who was\\nprobably the most grateful of mankind upon the least occasion, should\\nso desire to escape the gratitude of others.\\n\\nWe were all enchanted. I felt it a merited tribute to the engaging\\nqualities of Ada and Richard that Mr. Skimpole, seeing them for the\\nfirst time, should be so unreserved and should lay himself out to be\\nso exquisitely agreeable. They (and especially Richard) were\\nnaturally pleased, for similar reasons, and considered it no common\\nprivilege to be so freely confided in by such an attractive man. The\\nmore we listened, the more gaily Mr. Skimpole talked. And what with\\nhis fine hilarious manner and his engaging candour and his genial way\\nof lightly tossing his own weaknesses about, as if he had said, \"I am\\na child, you know! You are designing people compared with me\" (he\\nreally made me consider myself in that light) \"but I am gay and\\ninnocent; forget your worldly arts and play with me!\" the effect was\\nabsolutely dazzling.\\n\\nHe was so full of feeling too and had such a delicate sentiment for\\nwhat was beautiful or tender that he could have won a heart by that\\nalone. In the evening, when I was preparing to make tea and Ada was\\ntouching the piano in the adjoining room and softly humming a tune to\\nher cousin Richard, which they had happened to mention, he came and\\nsat down on the sofa near me and so spoke of Ada that I almost loved\\nhim.\\n\\n\"She is like the morning,\" he said. \"With that golden hair, those\\nblue eyes, and that fresh bloom on her cheek, she is like the summer\\nmorning. The birds here will mistake her for it. We will not call\\nsuch a lovely young creature as that, who is a joy to all mankind, an\\norphan. She is the child of the universe.\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce, I found, was standing near us with his hands behind him\\nand an attentive smile upon his face.\\n\\n\"The universe,\" he observed, \"makes rather an indifferent parent, I\\nam afraid.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I don\\'t know!\" cried Mr. Skimpole buoyantly.\\n\\n\"I think I do know,\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Well!\" cried Mr. Skimpole. \"You know the world (which in your sense\\nis the universe), and I know nothing of it, so you shall have your\\nway. But if I had mine,\" glancing at the cousins, \"there should be no\\nbrambles of sordid realities in such a path as that. It should be\\nstrewn with roses; it should lie through bowers, where there was no\\nspring, autumn, nor winter, but perpetual summer. Age or change\\nshould never wither it. The base word money should never be breathed\\nnear it!\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce patted him on the head with a smile, as if he had been\\nreally a child, and passing a step or two on, and stopping a moment,\\nglanced at the young cousins. His look was thoughtful, but had a\\nbenignant expression in it which I often (how often!) saw again,\\nwhich has long been engraven on my heart. The room in which they\\nwere, communicating with that in which he stood, was only lighted by\\nthe fire. Ada sat at the piano; Richard stood beside her, bending\\ndown. Upon the wall, their shadows blended together, surrounded by\\nstrange forms, not without a ghostly motion caught from the unsteady\\nfire, though reflecting from motionless objects. Ada touched the\\nnotes so softly and sang so low that the wind, sighing away to the\\ndistant hills, was as audible as the music. The mystery of the future\\nand the little clue afforded to it by the voice of the present seemed\\nexpressed in the whole picture.\\n\\nBut it is not to recall this fancy, well as I remember it, that I\\nrecall the scene. First, I was not quite unconscious of the contrast\\nin respect of meaning and intention between the silent look directed\\nthat way and the flow of words that had preceded it. Secondly, though\\nMr. Jarndyce\\'s glance as he withdrew it rested for but a moment on\\nme, I felt as if in that moment he confided to me--and knew that he\\nconfided to me and that I received the confidence--his hope that Ada\\nand Richard might one day enter on a dearer relationship.\\n\\nMr. Skimpole could play on the piano and the violoncello, and he was\\na composer--had composed half an opera once, but got tired of it--and\\nplayed what he composed with taste. After tea we had quite a little\\nconcert, in which Richard--who was enthralled by Ada\\'s singing and\\ntold me that she seemed to know all the songs that ever were\\nwritten--and Mr. Jarndyce, and I were the audience. After a little\\nwhile I missed first Mr. Skimpole and afterwards Richard, and while I\\nwas thinking how could Richard stay away so long and lose so much,\\nthe maid who had given me the keys looked in at the door, saying, \"If\\nyou please, miss, could you spare a minute?\"\\n\\nWhen I was shut out with her in the hall, she said, holding up her\\nhands, \"Oh, if you please, miss, Mr. Carstone says would you come\\nupstairs to Mr. Skimpole\\'s room. He has been took, miss!\"\\n\\n\"Took?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Took, miss. Sudden,\" said the maid.\\n\\nI was apprehensive that his illness might be of a dangerous kind, but\\nof course I begged her to be quiet and not disturb any one and\\ncollected myself, as I followed her quickly upstairs, sufficiently to\\nconsider what were the best remedies to be applied if it should prove\\nto be a fit. She threw open a door and I went into a chamber, where,\\nto my unspeakable surprise, instead of finding Mr. Skimpole stretched\\nupon the bed or prostrate on the floor, I found him standing before\\nthe fire smiling at Richard, while Richard, with a face of great\\nembarrassment, looked at a person on the sofa, in a white great-coat,\\nwith smooth hair upon his head and not much of it, which he was\\nwiping smoother and making less of with a pocket-handkerchief.\\n\\n\"Miss Summerson,\" said Richard hurriedly, \"I am glad you are come.\\nYou will be able to advise us. Our friend Mr. Skimpole--don\\'t be\\nalarmed!--is arrested for debt.\"\\n\\n\"And really, my dear Miss Summerson,\" said Mr. Skimpole with his\\nagreeable candour, \"I never was in a situation in which that\\nexcellent sense and quiet habit of method and usefulness, which\\nanybody must observe in you who has the happiness of being a quarter\\nof an hour in your society, was more needed.\"\\n\\nThe person on the sofa, who appeared to have a cold in his head, gave\\nsuch a very loud snort that he startled me.\\n\\n\"Are you arrested for much, sir?\" I inquired of Mr. Skimpole.\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Summerson,\" said he, shaking his head pleasantly, \"I\\ndon\\'t know. Some pounds, odd shillings, and halfpence, I think, were\\nmentioned.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s twenty-four pound, sixteen, and sevenpence ha\\'penny,\" observed\\nthe stranger. \"That\\'s wot it is.\"\\n\\n\"And it sounds--somehow it sounds,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"like a small\\nsum?\"\\n\\nThe strange man said nothing but made another snort. It was such a\\npowerful one that it seemed quite to lift him out of his seat.\\n\\n\"Mr. Skimpole,\" said Richard to me, \"has a delicacy in applying to my\\ncousin Jarndyce because he has lately--I think, sir, I understood you\\nthat you had lately--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" returned Mr. Skimpole, smiling. \"Though I forgot how much\\nit was and when it was. Jarndyce would readily do it again, but I\\nhave the epicure-like feeling that I would prefer a novelty in help,\\nthat I would rather,\" and he looked at Richard and me, \"develop\\ngenerosity in a new soil and in a new form of flower.\"\\n\\n\"What do you think will be best, Miss Summerson?\" said Richard,\\naside.\\n\\nI ventured to inquire, generally, before replying, what would happen\\nif the money were not produced.\\n\\n\"Jail,\" said the strange man, coolly putting his handkerchief into\\nhis hat, which was on the floor at his feet. \"Or Coavinses.\"\\n\\n\"May I ask, sir, what is--\"\\n\\n\"Coavinses?\" said the strange man. \"A \\'ouse.\"\\n\\nRichard and I looked at one another again. It was a most singular\\nthing that the arrest was our embarrassment and not Mr. Skimpole\\'s.\\nHe observed us with a genial interest, but there seemed, if I may\\nventure on such a contradiction, nothing selfish in it. He had\\nentirely washed his hands of the difficulty, and it had become ours.\\n\\n\"I thought,\" he suggested, as if good-naturedly to help us out, \"that\\nbeing parties in a Chancery suit concerning (as people say) a large\\namount of property, Mr. Richard or his beautiful cousin, or both,\\ncould sign something, or make over something, or give some sort of\\nundertaking, or pledge, or bond? I don\\'t know what the business name\\nof it may be, but I suppose there is some instrument within their\\npower that would settle this?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit on it,\" said the strange man.\\n\\n\"Really?\" returned Mr. Skimpole. \"That seems odd, now, to one who is\\nno judge of these things!\"\\n\\n\"Odd or even,\" said the stranger gruffly, \"I tell you, not a bit on\\nit!\"\\n\\n\"Keep your temper, my good fellow, keep your temper!\" Mr. Skimpole\\ngently reasoned with him as he made a little drawing of his head on\\nthe fly-leaf of a book. \"Don\\'t be ruffled by your occupation. We can\\nseparate you from your office; we can separate the individual from\\nthe pursuit. We are not so prejudiced as to suppose that in private\\nlife you are otherwise than a very estimable man, with a great deal\\nof poetry in your nature, of which you may not be conscious.\"\\n\\nThe stranger only answered with another violent snort, whether in\\nacceptance of the poetry-tribute or in disdainful rejection of it, he\\ndid not express to me.\\n\\n\"Now, my dear Miss Summerson, and my dear Mr. Richard,\" said Mr.\\nSkimpole gaily, innocently, and confidingly as he looked at his\\ndrawing with his head on one side, \"here you see me utterly incapable\\nof helping myself, and entirely in your hands! I only ask to be free.\\nThe butterflies are free. Mankind will surely not deny to Harold\\nSkimpole what it concedes to the butterflies!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Summerson,\" said Richard in a whisper, \"I have ten\\npounds that I received from Mr. Kenge. I must try what that will do.\"\\n\\nI possessed fifteen pounds, odd shillings, which I had saved from my\\nquarterly allowance during several years. I had always thought that\\nsome accident might happen which would throw me suddenly, without any\\nrelation or any property, on the world and had always tried to keep\\nsome little money by me that I might not be quite penniless. I told\\nRichard of my having this little store and having no present need of\\nit, and I asked him delicately to inform Mr. Skimpole, while I should\\nbe gone to fetch it, that we would have the pleasure of paying his\\ndebt.\\n\\nWhen I came back, Mr. Skimpole kissed my hand and seemed quite\\ntouched. Not on his own account (I was again aware of that perplexing\\nand extraordinary contradiction), but on ours, as if personal\\nconsiderations were impossible with him and the contemplation of our\\nhappiness alone affected him. Richard, begging me, for the greater\\ngrace of the transaction, as he said, to settle with Coavinses (as\\nMr. Skimpole now jocularly called him), I counted out the money and\\nreceived the necessary acknowledgment. This, too, delighted Mr.\\nSkimpole.\\n\\nHis compliments were so delicately administered that I blushed less\\nthan I might have done and settled with the stranger in the white\\ncoat without making any mistakes. He put the money in his pocket and\\nshortly said, \"Well, then, I\\'ll wish you a good evening, miss.\\n\\n\"My friend,\" said Mr. Skimpole, standing with his back to the fire\\nafter giving up the sketch when it was half finished, \"I should like\\nto ask you something, without offence.\"\\n\\nI think the reply was, \"Cut away, then!\"\\n\\n\"Did you know this morning, now, that you were coming out on this\\nerrand?\" said Mr. Skimpole.\\n\\n\"Know\\'d it yes\\'day aft\\'noon at tea-time,\" said Coavinses.\\n\\n\"It didn\\'t affect your appetite? Didn\\'t make you at all uneasy?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit,\" said Coavinses. \"I know\\'d if you wos missed to-day, you\\nwouldn\\'t be missed to-morrow. A day makes no such odds.\"\\n\\n\"But when you came down here,\" proceeded Mr. Skimpole, \"it was a fine\\nday. The sun was shining, the wind was blowing, the lights and\\nshadows were passing across the fields, the birds were singing.\"\\n\\n\"Nobody said they warn\\'t, in MY hearing,\" returned Coavinses.\\n\\n\"No,\" observed Mr. Skimpole. \"But what did you think upon the road?\"\\n\\n\"Wot do you mean?\" growled Coavinses with an appearance of strong\\nresentment. \"Think! I\\'ve got enough to do, and little enough to get\\nfor it without thinking. Thinking!\" (with profound contempt).\\n\\n\"Then you didn\\'t think, at all events,\" proceeded Mr. Skimpole, \"to\\nthis effect: \\'Harold Skimpole loves to see the sun shine, loves to\\nhear the wind blow, loves to watch the changing lights and shadows,\\nloves to hear the birds, those choristers in Nature\\'s great\\ncathedral. And does it seem to me that I am about to deprive Harold\\nSkimpole of his share in such possessions, which are his only\\nbirthright!\\' You thought nothing to that effect?\"\\n\\n\"I--certainly--did--NOT,\" said Coavinses, whose doggedness in utterly\\nrenouncing the idea was of that intense kind that he could only give\\nadequate expression to it by putting a long interval between each\\nword, and accompanying the last with a jerk that might have\\ndislocated his neck.\\n\\n\"Very odd and very curious, the mental process is, in you men of\\nbusiness!\" said Mr. Skimpole thoughtfully. \"Thank you, my friend.\\nGood night.\"\\n\\nAs our absence had been long enough already to seem strange\\ndownstairs, I returned at once and found Ada sitting at work by the\\nfireside talking to her cousin John. Mr. Skimpole presently appeared,\\nand Richard shortly after him. I was sufficiently engaged during the\\nremainder of the evening in taking my first lesson in backgammon from\\nMr. Jarndyce, who was very fond of the game and from whom I wished of\\ncourse to learn it as quickly as I could in order that I might be of\\nthe very small use of being able to play when he had no better\\nadversary. But I thought, occasionally, when Mr. Skimpole played some\\nfragments of his own compositions or when, both at the piano and the\\nvioloncello, and at our table, he preserved with an absence of all\\neffort his delightful spirits and his easy flow of conversation, that\\nRichard and I seemed to retain the transferred impression of having\\nbeen arrested since dinner and that it was very curious altogether.\\n\\nIt was late before we separated, for when Ada was going at eleven\\no\\'clock, Mr. Skimpole went to the piano and rattled hilariously that\\nthe best of all ways to lengthen our days was to steal a few hours\\nfrom night, my dear! It was past twelve before he took his candle and\\nhis radiant face out of the room, and I think he might have kept us\\nthere, if he had seen fit, until daybreak. Ada and Richard were\\nlingering for a few moments by the fire, wondering whether Mrs.\\nJellyby had yet finished her dictation for the day, when Mr.\\nJarndyce, who had been out of the room, returned.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear me, what\\'s this, what\\'s this!\" he said, rubbing his head\\nand walking about with his good-humoured vexation. \"What\\'s this they\\ntell me? Rick, my boy, Esther, my dear, what have you been doing? Why\\ndid you do it? How could you do it? How much apiece was it? The\\nwind\\'s round again. I feel it all over me!\"\\n\\nWe neither of us quite knew what to answer.\\n\\n\"Come, Rick, come! I must settle this before I sleep. How much are\\nyou out of pocket? You two made the money up, you know! Why did you?\\nHow could you? Oh, Lord, yes, it\\'s due east--must be!\"\\n\\n\"Really, sir,\" said Richard, \"I don\\'t think it would be honourable in\\nme to tell you. Mr. Skimpole relied upon us--\"\\n\\n\"Lord bless you, my dear boy! He relies upon everybody!\" said Mr.\\nJarndyce, giving his head a great rub and stopping short.\\n\\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Everybody! And he\\'ll be in the same scrape again next week!\" said\\nMr. Jarndyce, walking again at a great pace, with a candle in his\\nhand that had gone out. \"He\\'s always in the same scrape. He was born\\nin the same scrape. I verily believe that the announcement in the\\nnewspapers when his mother was confined was \\'On Tuesday last, at her\\nresidence in Botheration Buildings, Mrs. Skimpole of a son in\\ndifficulties.\\'\"\\n\\nRichard laughed heartily but added, \"Still, sir, I don\\'t want to\\nshake his confidence or to break his confidence, and if I submit to\\nyour better knowledge again, that I ought to keep his secret, I hope\\nyou will consider before you press me any more. Of course, if you do\\npress me, sir, I shall know I am wrong and will tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce, stopping again, and making several absent\\nendeavours to put his candlestick in his pocket. \"I--here! Take it\\naway, my dear. I don\\'t know what I am about with it; it\\'s all the\\nwind--invariably has that effect--I won\\'t press you, Rick; you may be\\nright. But really--to get hold of you and Esther--and to squeeze you\\nlike a couple of tender young Saint Michael\\'s oranges! It\\'ll blow a\\ngale in the course of the night!\"\\n\\nHe was now alternately putting his hands into his pockets as if he\\nwere going to keep them there a long time, and taking them out again\\nand vehemently rubbing them all over his head.\\n\\nI ventured to take this opportunity of hinting that Mr. Skimpole,\\nbeing in all such matters quite a child--\\n\\n\"Eh, my dear?\" said Mr. Jarndyce, catching at the word.\\n\\n\"Being quite a child, sir,\" said I, \"and so different from other\\npeople--\"\\n\\n\"You are right!\" said Mr. Jarndyce, brightening. \"Your woman\\'s wit\\nhits the mark. He is a child--an absolute child. I told you he was a\\nchild, you know, when I first mentioned him.\"\\n\\nCertainly! Certainly! we said.\\n\\n\"And he IS a child. Now, isn\\'t he?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce, brightening\\nmore and more.\\n\\nHe was indeed, we said.\\n\\n\"When you come to think of it, it\\'s the height of childishness in\\nyou--I mean me--\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to regard him for a moment as a\\nman. You can\\'t make HIM responsible. The idea of Harold Skimpole with\\ndesigns or plans, or knowledge of consequences! Ha, ha, ha!\"\\n\\nIt was so delicious to see the clouds about his bright face clearing,\\nand to see him so heartily pleased, and to know, as it was impossible\\nnot to know, that the source of his pleasure was the goodness which\\nwas tortured by condemning, or mistrusting, or secretly accusing any\\none, that I saw the tears in Ada\\'s eyes, while she echoed his laugh,\\nand felt them in my own.\\n\\n\"Why, what a cod\\'s head and shoulders I am,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to\\nrequire reminding of it! The whole business shows the child from\\nbeginning to end. Nobody but a child would have thought of singling\\nYOU two out for parties in the affair! Nobody but a child would have\\nthought of YOUR having the money! If it had been a thousand pounds,\\nit would have been just the same!\" said Mr. Jarndyce with his whole\\nface in a glow.\\n\\nWe all confirmed it from our night\\'s experience.\\n\\n\"To be sure, to be sure!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"However, Rick, Esther,\\nand you too, Ada, for I don\\'t know that even your little purse is\\nsafe from his inexperience--I must have a promise all round that\\nnothing of this sort shall ever be done any more. No advances! Not\\neven sixpences.\"\\n\\nWe all promised faithfully, Richard with a merry glance at me\\ntouching his pocket as if to remind me that there was no danger of\\nOUR transgressing.\\n\\n\"As to Skimpole,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"a habitable doll\\'s house with\\ngood board and a few tin people to get into debt with and borrow\\nmoney of would set the boy up in life. He is in a child\\'s sleep by\\nthis time, I suppose; it\\'s time I should take my craftier head to my\\nmore worldly pillow. Good night, my dears. God bless you!\"\\n\\nHe peeped in again, with a smiling face, before we had lighted our\\ncandles, and said, \"Oh! I have been looking at the weather-cock. I\\nfind it was a false alarm about the wind. It\\'s in the south!\" And\\nwent away singing to himself.\\n\\nAda and I agreed, as we talked together for a little while upstairs,\\nthat this caprice about the wind was a fiction and that he used the\\npretence to account for any disappointment he could not conceal,\\nrather than he would blame the real cause of it or disparage or\\ndepreciate any one. We thought this very characteristic of his\\neccentric gentleness and of the difference between him and those\\npetulant people who make the weather and the winds (particularly that\\nunlucky wind which he had chosen for such a different purpose) the\\nstalking-horses of their splenetic and gloomy humours.\\n\\nIndeed, so much affection for him had been added in this one evening\\nto my gratitude that I hoped I already began to understand him\\nthrough that mingled feeling. Any seeming inconsistencies in Mr.\\nSkimpole or in Mrs. Jellyby I could not expect to be able to\\nreconcile, having so little experience or practical knowledge.\\nNeither did I try, for my thoughts were busy when I was alone, with\\nAda and Richard and with the confidence I had seemed to receive\\nconcerning them. My fancy, made a little wild by the wind perhaps,\\nwould not consent to be all unselfish, either, though I would have\\npersuaded it to be so if I could. It wandered back to my godmother\\'s\\nhouse and came along the intervening track, raising up shadowy\\nspeculations which had sometimes trembled there in the dark as to\\nwhat knowledge Mr. Jarndyce had of my earliest history--even as to\\nthe possibility of his being my father, though that idle dream was\\nquite gone now.\\n\\nIt was all gone now, I remembered, getting up from the fire. It was\\nnot for me to muse over bygones, but to act with a cheerful spirit\\nand a grateful heart. So I said to myself, \"Esther, Esther, Esther!\\nDuty, my dear!\" and gave my little basket of housekeeping keys such a\\nshake that they sounded like little bells and rang me hopefully to\\nbed.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile Esther sleeps, and while Esther wakes, it is still wet weather\\ndown at the place in Lincolnshire. The rain is ever falling--drip,\\ndrip, drip--by day and night upon the broad flagged terrace-pavement,\\nthe Ghost\\'s Walk. The weather is so very bad down in Lincolnshire\\nthat the liveliest imagination can scarcely apprehend its ever being\\nfine again. Not that there is any superabundant life of imagination\\non the spot, for Sir Leicester is not here (and, truly, even if he\\nwere, would not do much for it in that particular), but is in Paris\\nwith my Lady; and solitude, with dusky wings, sits brooding upon\\nChesney Wold.\\n\\nThere may be some motions of fancy among the lower animals at Chesney\\nWold. The horses in the stables--the long stables in a barren,\\nred-brick court-yard, where there is a great bell in a turret, and a\\nclock with a large face, which the pigeons who live near it and who\\nlove to perch upon its shoulders seem to be always consulting--THEY\\nmay contemplate some mental pictures of fine weather on occasions,\\nand may be better artists at them than the grooms. The old roan, so\\nfamous for cross-country work, turning his large eyeball to the\\ngrated window near his rack, may remember the fresh leaves that\\nglisten there at other times and the scents that stream in, and may\\nhave a fine run with the hounds, while the human helper, clearing out\\nthe next stall, never stirs beyond his pitchfork and birch-broom. The\\ngrey, whose place is opposite the door and who with an impatient\\nrattle of his halter pricks his ears and turns his head so wistfully\\nwhen it is opened, and to whom the opener says, \"Woa grey, then,\\nsteady! Noabody wants you to-day!\" may know it quite as well as the\\nman. The whole seemingly monotonous and uncompanionable half-dozen,\\nstabled together, may pass the long wet hours when the door is shut\\nin livelier communication than is held in the servants\\' hall or at\\nthe Dedlock Arms, or may even beguile the time by improving (perhaps\\ncorrupting) the pony in the loose-box in the corner.\\n\\nSo the mastiff, dozing in his kennel in the court-yard with his large\\nhead on his paws, may think of the hot sunshine when the shadows of\\nthe stable-buildings tire his patience out by changing and leave him\\nat one time of the day no broader refuge than the shadow of his own\\nhouse, where he sits on end, panting and growling short, and very\\nmuch wanting something to worry besides himself and his chain. So\\nnow, half-waking and all-winking, he may recall the house full of\\ncompany, the coach-houses full of vehicles, the stables full of\\nhorses, and the out-buildings full of attendants upon horses, until\\nhe is undecided about the present and comes forth to see how it is.\\nThen, with that impatient shake of himself, he may growl in the\\nspirit, \"Rain, rain, rain! Nothing but rain--and no family here!\" as\\nhe goes in again and lies down with a gloomy yawn.\\n\\nSo with the dogs in the kennel-buildings across the park, who have\\ntheir restless fits and whose doleful voices when the wind has been\\nvery obstinate have even made it known in the house itself--upstairs,\\ndownstairs, and in my Lady\\'s chamber. They may hunt the whole\\ncountry-side, while the raindrops are pattering round their\\ninactivity. So the rabbits with their self-betraying tails, frisking\\nin and out of holes at roots of trees, may be lively with ideas of\\nthe breezy days when their ears are blown about or of those seasons\\nof interest when there are sweet young plants to gnaw. The turkey in\\nthe poultry-yard, always troubled with a class-grievance (probably\\nChristmas), may be reminiscent of that summer morning wrongfully\\ntaken from him when he got into the lane among the felled trees,\\nwhere there was a barn and barley. The discontented goose, who stoops\\nto pass under the old gateway, twenty feet high, may gabble out, if\\nwe only knew it, a waddling preference for weather when the gateway\\ncasts its shadow on the ground.\\n\\nBe this as it may, there is not much fancy otherwise stirring at\\nChesney Wold. If there be a little at any odd moment, it goes, like a\\nlittle noise in that old echoing place, a long way and usually leads\\noff to ghosts and mystery.\\n\\nIt has rained so hard and rained so long down in Lincolnshire that\\nMrs. Rouncewell, the old housekeeper at Chesney Wold, has several\\ntimes taken off her spectacles and cleaned them to make certain that\\nthe drops were not upon the glasses. Mrs. Rouncewell might have been\\nsufficiently assured by hearing the rain, but that she is rather\\ndeaf, which nothing will induce her to believe. She is a fine old\\nlady, handsome, stately, wonderfully neat, and has such a back and\\nsuch a stomacher that if her stays should turn out when she dies to\\nhave been a broad old-fashioned family fire-grate, nobody who knows\\nher would have cause to be surprised. Weather affects Mrs. Rouncewell\\nlittle. The house is there in all weathers, and the house, as she\\nexpresses it, \"is what she looks at.\" She sits in her room (in a side\\npassage on the ground floor, with an arched window commanding a\\nsmooth quadrangle, adorned at regular intervals with smooth round\\ntrees and smooth round blocks of stone, as if the trees were going to\\nplay at bowls with the stones), and the whole house reposes on her\\nmind. She can open it on occasion and be busy and fluttered, but it\\nis shut up now and lies on the breadth of Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s\\niron-bound bosom in a majestic sleep.\\n\\nIt is the next difficult thing to an impossibility to imagine Chesney\\nWold without Mrs. Rouncewell, but she has only been here fifty years.\\nAsk her how long, this rainy day, and she shall answer \"fifty year,\\nthree months, and a fortnight, by the blessing of heaven, if I live\\ntill Tuesday.\" Mr. Rouncewell died some time before the decease of\\nthe pretty fashion of pig-tails, and modestly hid his own (if he took\\nit with him) in a corner of the churchyard in the park near the\\nmouldy porch. He was born in the market-town, and so was his young\\nwidow. Her progress in the family began in the time of the last Sir\\nLeicester and originated in the still-room.\\n\\nThe present representative of the Dedlocks is an excellent master. He\\nsupposes all his dependents to be utterly bereft of individual\\ncharacters, intentions, or opinions, and is persuaded that he was\\nborn to supersede the necessity of their having any. If he were to\\nmake a discovery to the contrary, he would be simply stunned--would\\nnever recover himself, most likely, except to gasp and die. But he is\\nan excellent master still, holding it a part of his state to be so.\\nHe has a great liking for Mrs. Rouncewell; he says she is a most\\nrespectable, creditable woman. He always shakes hands with her when\\nhe comes down to Chesney Wold and when he goes away; and if he were\\nvery ill, or if he were knocked down by accident, or run over, or\\nplaced in any situation expressive of a Dedlock at a disadvantage, he\\nwould say if he could speak, \"Leave me, and send Mrs. Rouncewell\\nhere!\" feeling his dignity, at such a pass, safer with her than with\\nanybody else.\\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell has known trouble. She has had two sons, of whom the\\nyounger ran wild, and went for a soldier, and never came back. Even\\nto this hour, Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s calm hands lose their composure when\\nshe speaks of him, and unfolding themselves from her stomacher, hover\\nabout her in an agitated manner as she says what a likely lad, what a\\nfine lad, what a gay, good-humoured, clever lad he was! Her second\\nson would have been provided for at Chesney Wold and would have been\\nmade steward in due season, but he took, when he was a schoolboy, to\\nconstructing steam-engines out of saucepans and setting birds to draw\\ntheir own water with the least possible amount of labour, so\\nassisting them with artful contrivance of hydraulic pressure that a\\nthirsty canary had only, in a literal sense, to put his shoulder to\\nthe wheel and the job was done. This propensity gave Mrs. Rouncewell\\ngreat uneasiness. She felt it with a mother\\'s anguish to be a move in\\nthe Wat Tyler direction, well knowing that Sir Leicester had that\\ngeneral impression of an aptitude for any art to which smoke and a\\ntall chimney might be considered essential. But the doomed young\\nrebel (otherwise a mild youth, and very persevering), showing no sign\\nof grace as he got older but, on the contrary, constructing a model\\nof a power-loom, she was fain, with many tears, to mention his\\nbackslidings to the baronet. \"Mrs. Rouncewell,\" said Sir Leicester,\\n\"I can never consent to argue, as you know, with any one on any\\nsubject. You had better get rid of your boy; you had better get him\\ninto some Works. The iron country farther north is, I suppose, the\\ncongenial direction for a boy with these tendencies.\" Farther north\\nhe went, and farther north he grew up; and if Sir Leicester Dedlock\\never saw him when he came to Chesney Wold to visit his mother, or\\never thought of him afterwards, it is certain that he only regarded\\nhim as one of a body of some odd thousand conspirators, swarthy and\\ngrim, who were in the habit of turning out by torchlight two or three\\nnights in the week for unlawful purposes.\\n\\nNevertheless, Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s son has, in the course of nature and\\nart, grown up, and established himself, and married, and called unto\\nhim Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s grandson, who, being out of his apprenticeship,\\nand home from a journey in far countries, whither he was sent to\\nenlarge his knowledge and complete his preparations for the venture\\nof this life, stands leaning against the chimney-piece this very day\\nin Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s room at Chesney Wold.\\n\\n\"And, again and again, I am glad to see you, Watt! And, once again, I\\nam glad to see you, Watt!\" says Mrs. Rouncewell. \"You are a fine\\nyoung fellow. You are like your poor uncle George. Ah!\" Mrs.\\nRouncewell\\'s hands unquiet, as usual, on this reference.\\n\\n\"They say I am like my father, grandmother.\"\\n\\n\"Like him, also, my dear--but most like your poor uncle George! And\\nyour dear father.\" Mrs. Rouncewell folds her hands again. \"He is\\nwell?\"\\n\\n\"Thriving, grandmother, in every way.\"\\n\\n\"I am thankful!\" Mrs. Rouncewell is fond of her son but has a\\nplaintive feeling towards him, much as if he were a very honourable\\nsoldier who had gone over to the enemy.\\n\\n\"He is quite happy?\" says she.\\n\\n\"Quite.\"\\n\\n\"I am thankful! So he has brought you up to follow in his ways and\\nhas sent you into foreign countries and the like? Well, he knows\\nbest. There may be a world beyond Chesney Wold that I don\\'t\\nunderstand. Though I am not young, either. And I have seen a quantity\\nof good company too!\"\\n\\n\"Grandmother,\" says the young man, changing the subject, \"what a very\\npretty girl that was I found with you just now. You called her Rosa?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, child. She is daughter of a widow in the village. Maids are so\\nhard to teach, now-a-days, that I have put her about me young. She\\'s\\nan apt scholar and will do well. She shows the house already, very\\npretty. She lives with me at my table here.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I have not driven her away?\"\\n\\n\"She supposes we have family affairs to speak about, I dare say. She\\nis very modest. It is a fine quality in a young woman. And scarcer,\"\\nsays Mrs. Rouncewell, expanding her stomacher to its utmost limits,\\n\"than it formerly was!\"\\n\\nThe young man inclines his head in acknowledgment of the precepts of\\nexperience. Mrs. Rouncewell listens.\\n\\n\"Wheels!\" says she. They have long been audible to the younger ears\\nof her companion. \"What wheels on such a day as this, for gracious\\nsake?\"\\n\\nAfter a short interval, a tap at the door. \"Come in!\" A dark-eyed,\\ndark-haired, shy, village beauty comes in--so fresh in her rosy and\\nyet delicate bloom that the drops of rain which have beaten on her\\nhair look like the dew upon a flower fresh gathered.\\n\\n\"What company is this, Rosa?\" says Mrs. Rouncewell.\\n\\n\"It\\'s two young men in a gig, ma\\'am, who want to see the house--yes,\\nand if you please, I told them so!\" in quick reply to a gesture of\\ndissent from the housekeeper. \"I went to the hall-door and told them\\nit was the wrong day and the wrong hour, but the young man who was\\ndriving took off his hat in the wet and begged me to bring this card\\nto you.\"\\n\\n\"Read it, my dear Watt,\" says the housekeeper.\\n\\nRosa is so shy as she gives it to him that they drop it between them\\nand almost knock their foreheads together as they pick it up. Rosa is\\nshyer than before.\\n\\n\"Mr. Guppy\" is all the information the card yields.\\n\\n\"Guppy!\" repeats Mrs. Rouncewell, \"MR. Guppy! Nonsense, I never heard\\nof him!\"\\n\\n\"If you please, he told ME that!\" says Rosa. \"But he said that he and\\nthe other young gentleman came from London only last night by the\\nmail, on business at the magistrates\\' meeting, ten miles off, this\\nmorning, and that as their business was soon over, and they had heard\\na great deal said of Chesney Wold, and really didn\\'t know what to do\\nwith themselves, they had come through the wet to see it. They are\\nlawyers. He says he is not in Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s office, but he is\\nsure he may make use of Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s name if necessary.\"\\nFinding, now she leaves off, that she has been making quite a long\\nspeech, Rosa is shyer than ever.\\n\\nNow, Mr. Tulkinghorn is, in a manner, part and parcel of the place,\\nand besides, is supposed to have made Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s will. The old\\nlady relaxes, consents to the admission of the visitors as a favour,\\nand dismisses Rosa. The grandson, however, being smitten by a sudden\\nwish to see the house himself, proposes to join the party. The\\ngrandmother, who is pleased that he should have that interest,\\naccompanies him--though to do him justice, he is exceedingly\\nunwilling to trouble her.\\n\\n\"Much obliged to you, ma\\'am!\" says Mr. Guppy, divesting himself of\\nhis wet dreadnought in the hall. \"Us London lawyers don\\'t often get\\nan out, and when we do, we like to make the most of it, you know.\"\\n\\nThe old housekeeper, with a gracious severity of deportment, waves\\nher hand towards the great staircase. Mr. Guppy and his friend follow\\nRosa; Mrs. Rouncewell and her grandson follow them; a young gardener\\ngoes before to open the shutters.\\n\\nAs is usually the case with people who go over houses, Mr. Guppy and\\nhis friend are dead beat before they have well begun. They straggle\\nabout in wrong places, look at wrong things, don\\'t care for the right\\nthings, gape when more rooms are opened, exhibit profound depression\\nof spirits, and are clearly knocked up. In each successive chamber\\nthat they enter, Mrs. Rouncewell, who is as upright as the house\\nitself, rests apart in a window-seat or other such nook and listens\\nwith stately approval to Rosa\\'s exposition. Her grandson is so\\nattentive to it that Rosa is shyer than ever--and prettier. Thus they\\npass on from room to room, raising the pictured Dedlocks for a few\\nbrief minutes as the young gardener admits the light, and\\nreconsigning them to their graves as he shuts it out again. It\\nappears to the afflicted Mr. Guppy and his inconsolable friend that\\nthere is no end to the Dedlocks, whose family greatness seems to\\nconsist in their never having done anything to distinguish themselves\\nfor seven hundred years.\\n\\nEven the long drawing-room of Chesney Wold cannot revive Mr. Guppy\\'s\\nspirits. He is so low that he droops on the threshold and has hardly\\nstrength of mind to enter. But a portrait over the chimney-piece,\\npainted by the fashionable artist of the day, acts upon him like a\\ncharm. He recovers in a moment. He stares at it with uncommon\\ninterest; he seems to be fixed and fascinated by it.\\n\\n\"Dear me!\" says Mr. Guppy. \"Who\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"The picture over the fire-place,\" says Rosa, \"is the portrait of the\\npresent Lady Dedlock. It is considered a perfect likeness, and the\\nbest work of the master.\"\\n\\n\"Blest,\" says Mr. Guppy, staring in a kind of dismay at his friend,\\n\"if I can ever have seen her. Yet I know her! Has the picture been\\nengraved, miss?\"\\n\\n\"The picture has never been engraved. Sir Leicester has always\\nrefused permission.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" says Mr. Guppy in a low voice. \"I\\'ll be shot if it ain\\'t very\\ncurious how well I know that picture! So that\\'s Lady Dedlock, is it!\"\\n\\n\"The picture on the right is the present Sir Leicester Dedlock. The\\npicture on the left is his father, the late Sir Leicester.\"\\n\\nMr. Guppy has no eyes for either of these magnates. \"It\\'s\\nunaccountable to me,\" he says, still staring at the portrait, \"how\\nwell I know that picture! I\\'m dashed,\" adds Mr. Guppy, looking round,\\n\"if I don\\'t think I must have had a dream of that picture, you know!\"\\n\\nAs no one present takes any especial interest in Mr. Guppy\\'s dreams,\\nthe probability is not pursued. But he still remains so absorbed by\\nthe portrait that he stands immovable before it until the young\\ngardener has closed the shutters, when he comes out of the room in a\\ndazed state that is an odd though a sufficient substitute for\\ninterest and follows into the succeeding rooms with a confused stare,\\nas if he were looking everywhere for Lady Dedlock again.\\n\\nHe sees no more of her. He sees her rooms, which are the last shown,\\nas being very elegant, and he looks out of the windows from which she\\nlooked out, not long ago, upon the weather that bored her to death.\\nAll things have an end, even houses that people take infinite pains\\nto see and are tired of before they begin to see them. He has come to\\nthe end of the sight, and the fresh village beauty to the end of her\\ndescription; which is always this: \"The terrace below is much\\nadmired. It is called, from an old story in the family, the Ghost\\'s\\nWalk.\"\\n\\n\"No?\" says Mr. Guppy, greedily curious. \"What\\'s the story, miss? Is\\nit anything about a picture?\"\\n\\n\"Pray tell us the story,\" says Watt in a half whisper.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know it, sir.\" Rosa is shyer than ever.\\n\\n\"It is not related to visitors; it is almost forgotten,\" says the\\nhousekeeper, advancing. \"It has never been more than a family\\nanecdote.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll excuse my asking again if it has anything to do with a\\npicture, ma\\'am,\" observes Mr. Guppy, \"because I do assure you that\\nthe more I think of that picture the better I know it, without\\nknowing how I know it!\"\\n\\nThe story has nothing to do with a picture; the housekeeper can\\nguarantee that. Mr. Guppy is obliged to her for the information and\\nis, moreover, generally obliged. He retires with his friend, guided\\ndown another staircase by the young gardener, and presently is heard\\nto drive away. It is now dusk. Mrs. Rouncewell can trust to the\\ndiscretion of her two young hearers and may tell THEM how the terrace\\ncame to have that ghostly name.\\n\\nShe seats herself in a large chair by the fast-darkening window and\\ntells them: \"In the wicked days, my dears, of King Charles the\\nFirst--I mean, of course, in the wicked days of the rebels who\\nleagued themselves against that excellent king--Sir Morbury Dedlock\\nwas the owner of Chesney Wold. Whether there was any account of a\\nghost in the family before those days, I can\\'t say. I should think it\\nvery likely indeed.\"\\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell holds this opinion because she considers that a\\nfamily of such antiquity and importance has a right to a ghost. She\\nregards a ghost as one of the privileges of the upper classes, a\\ngenteel distinction to which the common people have no claim.\\n\\n\"Sir Morbury Dedlock,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell, \"was, I have no occasion\\nto say, on the side of the blessed martyr. But it IS supposed that\\nhis Lady, who had none of the family blood in her veins, favoured the\\nbad cause. It is said that she had relations among King Charles\\'s\\nenemies, that she was in correspondence with them, and that she gave\\nthem information. When any of the country gentlemen who followed his\\nMajesty\\'s cause met here, it is said that my Lady was always nearer\\nto the door of their council-room than they supposed. Do you hear a\\nsound like a footstep passing along the terrace, Watt?\"\\n\\nRosa draws nearer to the housekeeper.\\n\\n\"I hear the rain-drip on the stones,\" replies the young man, \"and I\\nhear a curious echo--I suppose an echo--which is very like a halting\\nstep.\"\\n\\nThe housekeeper gravely nods and continues: \"Partly on account of\\nthis division between them, and partly on other accounts, Sir Morbury\\nand his Lady led a troubled life. She was a lady of a haughty temper.\\nThey were not well suited to each other in age or character, and they\\nhad no children to moderate between them. After her favourite\\nbrother, a young gentleman, was killed in the civil wars (by Sir\\nMorbury\\'s near kinsman), her feeling was so violent that she hated\\nthe race into which she had married. When the Dedlocks were about to\\nride out from Chesney Wold in the king\\'s cause, she is supposed to\\nhave more than once stolen down into the stables in the dead of night\\nand lamed their horses; and the story is that once at such an hour,\\nher husband saw her gliding down the stairs and followed her into the\\nstall where his own favourite horse stood. There he seized her by the\\nwrist, and in a struggle or in a fall or through the horse being\\nfrightened and lashing out, she was lamed in the hip and from that\\nhour began to pine away.\"\\n\\nThe housekeeper has dropped her voice to a little more than a\\nwhisper.\\n\\n\"She had been a lady of a handsome figure and a noble carriage. She\\nnever complained of the change; she never spoke to any one of being\\ncrippled or of being in pain, but day by day she tried to walk upon\\nthe terrace, and with the help of the stone balustrade, went up and\\ndown, up and down, up and down, in sun and shadow, with greater\\ndifficulty every day. At last, one afternoon her husband (to whom she\\nhad never, on any persuasion, opened her lips since that night),\\nstanding at the great south window, saw her drop upon the pavement.\\nHe hastened down to raise her, but she repulsed him as he bent over\\nher, and looking at him fixedly and coldly, said, \\'I will die here\\nwhere I have walked. And I will walk here, though I am in my grave. I\\nwill walk here until the pride of this house is humbled. And when\\ncalamity or when disgrace is coming to it, let the Dedlocks listen\\nfor my step!\\'\"\\n\\nWatt looks at Rosa. Rosa in the deepening gloom looks down upon the\\nground, half frightened and half shy.\\n\\n\"There and then she died. And from those days,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell,\\n\"the name has come down--the Ghost\\'s Walk. If the tread is an echo,\\nit is an echo that is only heard after dark, and is often unheard for\\na long while together. But it comes back from time to time; and so\\nsure as there is sickness or death in the family, it will be heard\\nthen.\"\\n\\n\"And disgrace, grandmother--\" says Watt.\\n\\n\"Disgrace never comes to Chesney Wold,\" returns the housekeeper.\\n\\nHer grandson apologizes with \"True. True.\"\\n\\n\"That is the story. Whatever the sound is, it is a worrying sound,\"\\nsays Mrs. Rouncewell, getting up from her chair; \"and what is to be\\nnoticed in it is that it MUST BE HEARD. My Lady, who is afraid of\\nnothing, admits that when it is there, it must be heard. You cannot\\nshut it out. Watt, there is a tall French clock behind you (placed\\nthere, \\'a purpose) that has a loud beat when it is in motion and can\\nplay music. You understand how those things are managed?\"\\n\\n\"Pretty well, grandmother, I think.\"\\n\\n\"Set it a-going.\"\\n\\nWatt sets it a-going--music and all.\\n\\n\"Now, come hither,\" says the housekeeper. \"Hither, child, towards my\\nLady\\'s pillow. I am not sure that it is dark enough yet, but listen!\\nCan you hear the sound upon the terrace, through the music, and the\\nbeat, and everything?\"\\n\\n\"I certainly can!\"\\n\\n\"So my Lady says.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'model_output': \" Esther describes the dreary weather at Chesney Wold and introduces Mrs. Rouncewell, the old housekeeper. She recounts Mrs. Rouncewell's family history, including her two sons - one who became a soldier and never returned, the other who went to work in the iron country up north. \\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell's grandson Watt visits her at Chesney Wold. Two young lawyers, Mr. Guppy and his friend, arrive to tour the house. Mrs. Rouncewell shows them around and tells the story of the Ghost's Walk - how Lady Dedlock was crippled by her husband when he caught her trying to lame his horse. She swore to haunt the terrace even after her death. Mrs. Rouncewell has Watt and Rosa listen for the ghostly footsteps to prove the legend is true.\"}, {'summary': 'Esther and Mr. Jarndyce discuss the Chancery suit, and Esther leans that it is a hopeless muddle, and anything left of the great fortune disputed within it has been consumed by legal costs. The story of Tom Jarndyce is related again; we learn that Bleak House, once called Peaks, took its name during Tom Jarndyce\\'s lifetime because he allowed it to go to rack and ruin. The street of houses in London, which we will learn later is called Tom-all-Alone\\'s, is part of the suit also. Esther learns that Mr. Jarndyce, who begs her to call him Guardian, has a little room he retreats to when he is out of sorts called \"The Growlery.\"\\n\\nMrs. Pardiggle and her five miserable sons arrive for a visit. Mrs. Pardiggle is a country version of Mrs. Jellyby, another obsessive and misguided philanthropist who neglects her children in favor of a fashionable charity. She takes the young people to a brickmaker\\'s hovel in the village, and there Ada and Esther witness not only the lives of poverty and filth and despair that the people there live, but also the death of the brickmaker\\'s baby in his mother\\'s (Jenny) lap. The girls are much moved, and Esther significantly covers the tiny corpse with her handkerchief. The young ladies are moved by the downtrodden, beaten brickmakers\\' wives (Jenny and Liz) comforting each other, and it is contrasted with their bluster and ineffectual do-gooding. They come back later to comfort Jenny.\\n\\nIn Chapter 9 Richard is unsure what to do with his life. Esther and Jarndyce had discussed what he should do for a profession, and the two agree that to ask him what he would like to do would be best. But Richard cannot decide, and it becomes apparent that the spectre of the Chancery suit, though he claims to ignore it, holds a psychic hold on him.\\n\\nMr. Boythorn has written Mr. Jandyce a letter, and he is coming for a visit. He arrives and proves to be a boisterous and agreeable companion. We learn that he was once to have been married, but his fiance \"died to him.\" The dispute over the right-of-way between Sir Leicester Dedlock and Boythorn, who are neighbors, is introduced, and Boythorn is voluble in his criticism of the baronet. However, Boythorn is fond of Lady Dedlock.\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce writes to Sir Leicester Dedlock, who is a distant relative of Richard, to ask with help placing Richard in the world. He receives no likely help from that quarter.\\n\\nIt becomes obvious to Esther that Ada and Richard have fallen in love. Mr. Guppy arrives at Bleak House on an errand for Kenge and Carboy\\'s. He proposes marriage to Esther, who firmly rejects him.\\n\\nIn Chapter 10 Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby and their law-stationery shop in London are described. Mrs. Snagsby is an awful termagent, and Mr. Snagsby is timid and cowed. They have a maid, Guster, who is prone to fits. It is a pathetic description, for Mr. Snagsby appears to be a decent man.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn\\'s London lodgings are described, where \"lawyers lie like maggots in nuts\". Mr. Tulkinghorn goes to Snagsby\\'s shop to find out who copied out the paper of Jarndyce and Jarndyce in which Lady Dedlock took such an interest. The Coavinses sherrif\\'s officers (bailiff\\'s -- repossesion agents) offices, the firm in which Neckett the debt-collector for Skimpole employed, are nearby.\\n\\nMr. Snagsby informs Mr. Tulkinghorn that a man called Nemo (the Latin for \"no one\"), who lives above Krook\\'s shop, is the copyist. Mr. Snagsby brings Mr. Tulkinghorn to Krook\\'s shop, and Mr. Tulkinghorn goes up to Nemo\\'s room, where he finds him lying on the bed with the scent of opium in the shabby room.', 'text': 'It was interesting when I dressed before daylight to peep out of\\nwindow, where my candles were reflected in the black panes like\\ntwo beacons, and finding all beyond still enshrouded in the\\nindistinctness of last night, to watch how it turned out when the day\\ncame on. As the prospect gradually revealed itself and disclosed the\\nscene over which the wind had wandered in the dark, like my memory\\nover my life, I had a pleasure in discovering the unknown objects\\nthat had been around me in my sleep. At first they were faintly\\ndiscernible in the mist, and above them the later stars still\\nglimmered. That pale interval over, the picture began to enlarge and\\nfill up so fast that at every new peep I could have found enough\\nto look at for an hour. Imperceptibly my candles became the only\\nincongruous part of the morning, the dark places in my room all\\nmelted away, and the day shone bright upon a cheerful landscape,\\nprominent in which the old Abbey Church, with its massive tower,\\nthrew a softer train of shadow on the view than seemed compatible\\nwith its rugged character. But so from rough outsides (I hope I have\\nlearnt), serene and gentle influences often proceed.\\n\\nEvery part of the house was in such order, and every one was so\\nattentive to me, that I had no trouble with my two bunches of keys,\\nthough what with trying to remember the contents of each little\\nstore-room drawer and cupboard; and what with making notes on a slate\\nabout jams, and pickles, and preserves, and bottles, and glass, and\\nchina, and a great many other things; and what with being generally a\\nmethodical, old-maidish sort of foolish little person, I was so busy\\nthat I could not believe it was breakfast-time when I heard the bell\\nring. Away I ran, however, and made tea, as I had already been\\ninstalled into the responsibility of the tea-pot; and then, as they\\nwere all rather late and nobody was down yet, I thought I would take\\na peep at the garden and get some knowledge of that too. I found it\\nquite a delightful place--in front, the pretty avenue and drive by\\nwhich we had approached (and where, by the by, we had cut up the\\ngravel so terribly with our wheels that I asked the gardener to roll\\nit); at the back, the flower-garden, with my darling at her window up\\nthere, throwing it open to smile out at me, as if she would have\\nkissed me from that distance. Beyond the flower-garden was a\\nkitchen-garden, and then a paddock, and then a snug little rick-yard,\\nand then a dear little farm-yard. As to the house itself, with its\\nthree peaks in the roof; its various-shaped windows, some so large,\\nsome so small, and all so pretty; its trellis-work, against the\\nsouth-front for roses and honey-suckle, and its homely, comfortable,\\nwelcoming look--it was, as Ada said when she came out to meet me with\\nher arm through that of its master, worthy of her cousin John, a bold\\nthing to say, though he only pinched her dear cheek for it.\\n\\nMr. Skimpole was as agreeable at breakfast as he had been overnight.\\nThere was honey on the table, and it led him into a discourse about\\nbees. He had no objection to honey, he said (and I should think he\\nhad not, for he seemed to like it), but he protested against the\\noverweening assumptions of bees. He didn\\'t at all see why the busy\\nbee should be proposed as a model to him; he supposed the bee liked\\nto make honey, or he wouldn\\'t do it--nobody asked him. It was not\\nnecessary for the bee to make such a merit of his tastes. If every\\nconfectioner went buzzing about the world banging against everything\\nthat came in his way and egotistically calling upon everybody to take\\nnotice that he was going to his work and must not be interrupted, the\\nworld would be quite an unsupportable place. Then, after all, it was\\na ridiculous position to be smoked out of your fortune with brimstone\\nas soon as you had made it. You would have a very mean opinion of a\\nManchester man if he spun cotton for no other purpose. He must say he\\nthought a drone the embodiment of a pleasanter and wiser idea. The\\ndrone said unaffectedly, \"You will excuse me; I really cannot attend\\nto the shop! I find myself in a world in which there is so much to\\nsee and so short a time to see it in that I must take the liberty of\\nlooking about me and begging to be provided for by somebody who\\ndoesn\\'t want to look about him.\" This appeared to Mr. Skimpole to be\\nthe drone philosophy, and he thought it a very good philosophy,\\nalways supposing the drone to be willing to be on good terms with the\\nbee, which, so far as he knew, the easy fellow always was, if the\\nconsequential creature would only let him, and not be so conceited\\nabout his honey!\\n\\nHe pursued this fancy with the lightest foot over a variety of ground\\nand made us all merry, though again he seemed to have as serious a\\nmeaning in what he said as he was capable of having. I left them\\nstill listening to him when I withdrew to attend to my new duties.\\nThey had occupied me for some time, and I was passing through the\\npassages on my return with my basket of keys on my arm when Mr.\\nJarndyce called me into a small room next his bed-chamber, which I\\nfound to be in part a little library of books and papers and in part\\nquite a little museum of his boots and shoes and hat-boxes.\\n\\n\"Sit down, my dear,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"This, you must know, is the\\ngrowlery. When I am out of humour, I come and growl here.\"\\n\\n\"You must be here very seldom, sir,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh, you don\\'t know me!\" he returned. \"When I am deceived or\\ndisappointed in--the wind, and it\\'s easterly, I take refuge here. The\\ngrowlery is the best-used room in the house. You are not aware of\\nhalf my humours yet. My dear, how you are trembling!\"\\n\\nI could not help it; I tried very hard, but being alone with that\\nbenevolent presence, and meeting his kind eyes, and feeling so happy\\nand so honoured there, and my heart so full--I kissed his hand. I\\ndon\\'t know what I said, or even that I spoke. He was disconcerted and\\nwalked to the window; I almost believed with an intention of jumping\\nout, until he turned and I was reassured by seeing in his eyes what\\nhe had gone there to hide. He gently patted me on the head, and I sat\\ndown.\\n\\n\"There! There!\" he said. \"That\\'s over. Pooh! Don\\'t be foolish.\"\\n\\n\"It shall not happen again, sir,\" I returned, \"but at first it is\\ndifficult--\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\" he said. \"It\\'s easy, easy. Why not? I hear of a good\\nlittle orphan girl without a protector, and I take it into my head to\\nbe that protector. She grows up, and more than justifies my good\\nopinion, and I remain her guardian and her friend. What is there in\\nall this? So, so! Now, we have cleared off old scores, and I have\\nbefore me thy pleasant, trusting, trusty face again.\"\\n\\nI said to myself, \"Esther, my dear, you surprise me! This really is\\nnot what I expected of you!\" And it had such a good effect that I\\nfolded my hands upon my basket and quite recovered myself. Mr.\\nJarndyce, expressing his approval in his face, began to talk to me as\\nconfidentially as if I had been in the habit of conversing with him\\nevery morning for I don\\'t know how long. I almost felt as if I had.\\n\\n\"Of course, Esther,\" he said, \"you don\\'t understand this Chancery\\nbusiness?\"\\n\\nAnd of course I shook my head.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know who does,\" he returned. \"The lawyers have twisted it\\ninto such a state of bedevilment that the original merits of the case\\nhave long disappeared from the face of the earth. It\\'s about a will\\nand the trusts under a will--or it was once. It\\'s about nothing but\\ncosts now. We are always appearing, and disappearing, and swearing,\\nand interrogating, and filing, and cross-filing, and arguing, and\\nsealing, and motioning, and referring, and reporting, and revolving\\nabout the Lord Chancellor and all his satellites, and equitably\\nwaltzing ourselves off to dusty death, about costs. That\\'s the great\\nquestion. All the rest, by some extraordinary means, has melted\\naway.\"\\n\\n\"But it was, sir,\" said I, to bring him back, for he began to rub his\\nhead, \"about a will?\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes, it was about a will when it was about anything,\" he\\nreturned. \"A certain Jarndyce, in an evil hour, made a great fortune,\\nand made a great will. In the question how the trusts under that will\\nare to be administered, the fortune left by the will is squandered\\naway; the legatees under the will are reduced to such a miserable\\ncondition that they would be sufficiently punished if they had\\ncommitted an enormous crime in having money left them, and the will\\nitself is made a dead letter. All through the deplorable cause,\\neverything that everybody in it, except one man, knows already is\\nreferred to that only one man who don\\'t know, it to find out--all\\nthrough the deplorable cause, everybody must have copies, over and\\nover again, of everything that has accumulated about it in the way of\\ncartloads of papers (or must pay for them without having them, which\\nis the usual course, for nobody wants them) and must go down the\\nmiddle and up again through such an infernal country-dance of costs\\nand fees and nonsense and corruption as was never dreamed of in the\\nwildest visions of a witch\\'s Sabbath. Equity sends questions to law,\\nlaw sends questions back to equity; law finds it can\\'t do this,\\nequity finds it can\\'t do that; neither can so much as say it can\\'t\\ndo anything, without this solicitor instructing and this counsel\\nappearing for A, and that solicitor instructing and that counsel\\nappearing for B; and so on through the whole alphabet, like the\\nhistory of the apple pie. And thus, through years and years, and\\nlives and lives, everything goes on, constantly beginning over and\\nover again, and nothing ever ends. And we can\\'t get out of the suit\\non any terms, for we are made parties to it, and MUST BE parties to\\nit, whether we like it or not. But it won\\'t do to think of it! When\\nmy great uncle, poor Tom Jarndyce, began to think of it, it was the\\nbeginning of the end!\"\\n\\n\"The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard?\"\\n\\nHe nodded gravely. \"I was his heir, and this was his house, Esther.\\nWhen I came here, it was bleak indeed. He had left the signs of his\\nmisery upon it.\"\\n\\n\"How changed it must be now!\" I said.\\n\\n\"It had been called, before his time, the Peaks. He gave it its\\npresent name and lived here shut up, day and night poring over the\\nwicked heaps of papers in the suit and hoping against hope to\\ndisentangle it from its mystification and bring it to a close. In the\\nmeantime, the place became dilapidated, the wind whistled through the\\ncracked walls, the rain fell through the broken roof, the weeds\\nchoked the passage to the rotting door. When I brought what remained\\nof him home here, the brains seemed to me to have been blown out of\\nthe house too, it was so shattered and ruined.\"\\n\\nHe walked a little to and fro after saying this to himself with a\\nshudder, and then looked at me, and brightened, and came and sat down\\nagain with his hands in his pockets.\\n\\n\"I told you this was the growlery, my dear. Where was I?\"\\n\\nI reminded him, at the hopeful change he had made in Bleak House.\\n\\n\"Bleak House; true. There is, in that city of London there, some\\nproperty of ours which is much at this day what Bleak House was then;\\nI say property of ours, meaning of the suit\\'s, but I ought to call it\\nthe property of costs, for costs is the only power on earth that will\\never get anything out of it now or will ever know it for anything but\\nan eyesore and a heartsore. It is a street of perishing blind houses,\\nwith their eyes stoned out, without a pane of glass, without so much\\nas a window-frame, with the bare blank shutters tumbling from their\\nhinges and falling asunder, the iron rails peeling away in flakes of\\nrust, the chimneys sinking in, the stone steps to every door (and\\nevery door might be death\\'s door) turning stagnant green, the very\\ncrutches on which the ruins are propped decaying. Although Bleak\\nHouse was not in Chancery, its master was, and it was stamped with\\nthe same seal. These are the Great Seal\\'s impressions, my dear, all\\nover England--the children know them!\"\\n\\n\"How changed it is!\" I said again.\\n\\n\"Why, so it is,\" he answered much more cheerfully; \"and it is wisdom\\nin you to keep me to the bright side of the picture.\" (The idea of my\\nwisdom!) \"These are things I never talk about or even think about,\\nexcepting in the growlery here. If you consider it right to mention\\nthem to Rick and Ada,\" looking seriously at me, \"you can. I leave it\\nto your discretion, Esther.\"\\n\\n\"I hope, sir--\" said I.\\n\\n\"I think you had better call me guardian, my dear.\"\\n\\nI felt that I was choking again--I taxed myself with it, \"Esther,\\nnow, you know you are!\"--when he feigned to say this slightly, as if\\nit were a whim instead of a thoughtful tenderness. But I gave the\\nhousekeeping keys the least shake in the world as a reminder to\\nmyself, and folding my hands in a still more determined manner on the\\nbasket, looked at him quietly.\\n\\n\"I hope, guardian,\" said I, \"that you may not trust too much to my\\ndiscretion. I hope you may not mistake me. I am afraid it will be a\\ndisappointment to you to know that I am not clever, but it really is\\nthe truth, and you would soon find it out if I had not the honesty to\\nconfess it.\"\\n\\nHe did not seem at all disappointed; quite the contrary. He told me,\\nwith a smile all over his face, that he knew me very well indeed and\\nthat I was quite clever enough for him.\\n\\n\"I hope I may turn out so,\" said I, \"but I am much afraid of it,\\nguardian.\"\\n\\n\"You are clever enough to be the good little woman of our lives here,\\nmy dear,\" he returned playfully; \"the little old woman of the child\\'s\\n(I don\\'t mean Skimpole\\'s) rhyme:\\n\\n\\n   \"\\'Little old woman, and whither so high?\\'\\n    \\'To sweep the cobwebs out of the sky.\\'\\n\\n\\n\"You will sweep them so neatly out of OUR sky in the course of your\\nhousekeeping, Esther, that one of these days we shall have to abandon\\nthe growlery and nail up the door.\"\\n\\nThis was the beginning of my being called Old Woman, and Little Old\\nWoman, and Cobweb, and Mrs. Shipton, and Mother Hubbard, and Dame\\nDurden, and so many names of that sort that my own name soon became\\nquite lost among them.\\n\\n\"However,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to return to our gossip. Here\\'s Rick,\\na fine young fellow full of promise. What\\'s to be done with him?\"\\n\\nOh, my goodness, the idea of asking my advice on such a point!\\n\\n\"Here he is, Esther,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, comfortably putting his\\nhands into his pockets and stretching out his legs. \"He must have a\\nprofession; he must make some choice for himself. There will be a\\nworld more wiglomeration about it, I suppose, but it must be done.\"\\n\\n\"More what, guardian?\" said I.\\n\\n\"More wiglomeration,\" said he. \"It\\'s the only name I know for the\\nthing. He is a ward in Chancery, my dear. Kenge and Carboy will have\\nsomething to say about it; Master Somebody--a sort of ridiculous\\nsexton, digging graves for the merits of causes in a back room at the\\nend of Quality Court, Chancery Lane--will have something to say about\\nit; counsel will have something to say about it; the Chancellor will\\nhave something to say about it; the satellites will have something to\\nsay about it; they will all have to be handsomely feed, all round,\\nabout it; the whole thing will be vastly ceremonious, wordy,\\nunsatisfactory, and expensive, and I call it, in general,\\nwiglomeration. How mankind ever came to be afflicted with\\nwiglomeration, or for whose sins these young people ever fell into a\\npit of it, I don\\'t know; so it is.\"\\n\\nHe began to rub his head again and to hint that he felt the wind. But\\nit was a delightful instance of his kindness towards me that whether\\nhe rubbed his head, or walked about, or did both, his face was sure\\nto recover its benignant expression as it looked at mine; and he was\\nsure to turn comfortable again and put his hands in his pockets and\\nstretch out his legs.\\n\\n\"Perhaps it would be best, first of all,\" said I, \"to ask Mr. Richard\\nwhat he inclines to himself.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly so,\" he returned. \"That\\'s what I mean! You know, just\\naccustom yourself to talk it over, with your tact and in your quiet\\nway, with him and Ada, and see what you all make of it. We are sure\\nto come at the heart of the matter by your means, little woman.\"\\n\\nI really was frightened at the thought of the importance I was\\nattaining and the number of things that were being confided to me. I\\nhad not meant this at all; I had meant that he should speak to\\nRichard. But of course I said nothing in reply except that I would do\\nmy best, though I feared (I really felt it necessary to repeat this)\\nthat he thought me much more sagacious than I was. At which my\\nguardian only laughed the pleasantest laugh I ever heard.\\n\\n\"Come!\" he said, rising and pushing back his chair. \"I think we may\\nhave done with the growlery for one day! Only a concluding word.\\nEsther, my dear, do you wish to ask me anything?\"\\n\\nHe looked so attentively at me that I looked attentively at him and\\nfelt sure I understood him.\\n\\n\"About myself, sir?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Guardian,\" said I, venturing to put my hand, which was suddenly\\ncolder than I could have wished, in his, \"nothing! I am quite sure\\nthat if there were anything I ought to know or had any need to know,\\nI should not have to ask you to tell it to me. If my whole reliance\\nand confidence were not placed in you, I must have a hard heart\\nindeed. I have nothing to ask you, nothing in the world.\"\\n\\nHe drew my hand through his arm and we went away to look for Ada.\\nFrom that hour I felt quite easy with him, quite unreserved, quite\\ncontent to know no more, quite happy.\\n\\nWe lived, at first, rather a busy life at Bleak House, for we had to\\nbecome acquainted with many residents in and out of the neighbourhood\\nwho knew Mr. Jarndyce. It seemed to Ada and me that everybody knew\\nhim who wanted to do anything with anybody else\\'s money. It amazed us\\nwhen we began to sort his letters and to answer some of them for him\\nin the growlery of a morning to find how the great object of the\\nlives of nearly all his correspondents appeared to be to form\\nthemselves into committees for getting in and laying out money. The\\nladies were as desperate as the gentlemen; indeed, I think they were\\neven more so. They threw themselves into committees in the most\\nimpassioned manner and collected subscriptions with a vehemence quite\\nextraordinary. It appeared to us that some of them must pass their\\nwhole lives in dealing out subscription-cards to the whole\\npost-office directory--shilling cards, half-crown cards,\\nhalf-sovereign cards, penny cards. They wanted everything. They\\nwanted wearing apparel, they wanted linen rags, they wanted money,\\nthey wanted coals, they wanted soup, they wanted interest, they\\nwanted autographs, they wanted flannel, they wanted whatever Mr.\\nJarndyce had--or had not. Their objects were as various as their\\ndemands. They were going to raise new buildings, they were going to\\npay off debts on old buildings, they were going to establish in a\\npicturesque building (engraving of proposed west elevation attached)\\nthe Sisterhood of Mediaeval Marys, they were going to give a\\ntestimonial to Mrs. Jellyby, they were going to have their\\nsecretary\\'s portrait painted and presented to his mother-in-law,\\nwhose deep devotion to him was well known, they were going to get up\\neverything, I really believe, from five hundred thousand tracts to an\\nannuity and from a marble monument to a silver tea-pot. They took a\\nmultitude of titles. They were the Women of England, the Daughters of\\nBritain, the Sisters of all the cardinal virtues separately, the\\nFemales of America, the Ladies of a hundred denominations. They\\nappeared to be always excited about canvassing and electing. They\\nseemed to our poor wits, and according to their own accounts, to be\\nconstantly polling people by tens of thousands, yet never bringing\\ntheir candidates in for anything. It made our heads ache to think, on\\nthe whole, what feverish lives they must lead.\\n\\nAmong the ladies who were most distinguished for this rapacious\\nbenevolence (if I may use the expression) was a Mrs. Pardiggle, who\\nseemed, as I judged from the number of her letters to Mr. Jarndyce,\\nto be almost as powerful a correspondent as Mrs. Jellyby herself. We\\nobserved that the wind always changed when Mrs. Pardiggle became the\\nsubject of conversation and that it invariably interrupted Mr.\\nJarndyce and prevented his going any farther, when he had remarked\\nthat there were two classes of charitable people; one, the people who\\ndid a little and made a great deal of noise; the other, the people\\nwho did a great deal and made no noise at all. We were therefore\\ncurious to see Mrs. Pardiggle, suspecting her to be a type of the\\nformer class, and were glad when she called one day with her five\\nyoung sons.\\n\\nShe was a formidable style of lady with spectacles, a prominent nose,\\nand a loud voice, who had the effect of wanting a great deal of room.\\nAnd she really did, for she knocked down little chairs with her\\nskirts that were quite a great way off. As only Ada and I were at\\nhome, we received her timidly, for she seemed to come in like cold\\nweather and to make the little Pardiggles blue as they followed.\\n\\n\"These, young ladies,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle with great volubility\\nafter the first salutations, \"are my five boys. You may have seen\\ntheir names in a printed subscription list (perhaps more than one) in\\nthe possession of our esteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce. Egbert, my eldest\\n(twelve), is the boy who sent out his pocket-money, to the amount of\\nfive and threepence, to the Tockahoopo Indians. Oswald, my second\\n(ten and a half), is the child who contributed two and nine-pence to\\nthe Great National Smithers Testimonial. Francis, my third (nine),\\none and sixpence halfpenny; Felix, my fourth (seven), eightpence to\\nthe Superannuated Widows; Alfred, my youngest (five), has voluntarily\\nenrolled himself in the Infant Bonds of Joy, and is pledged never,\\nthrough life, to use tobacco in any form.\"\\n\\nWe had never seen such dissatisfied children. It was not merely that\\nthey were weazened and shrivelled--though they were certainly that\\ntoo--but they looked absolutely ferocious with discontent. At the\\nmention of the Tockahoopo Indians, I could really have supposed\\nEgbert to be one of the most baleful members of that tribe, he gave\\nme such a savage frown. The face of each child, as the amount of his\\ncontribution was mentioned, darkened in a peculiarly vindictive\\nmanner, but his was by far the worst. I must except, however, the\\nlittle recruit into the Infant Bonds of Joy, who was stolidly and\\nevenly miserable.\\n\\n\"You have been visiting, I understand,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"at Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s?\"\\n\\nWe said yes, we had passed one night there.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Jellyby,\" pursued the lady, always speaking in the same\\ndemonstrative, loud, hard tone, so that her voice impressed my fancy\\nas if it had a sort of spectacles on too--and I may take the\\nopportunity of remarking that her spectacles were made the less\\nengaging by her eyes being what Ada called \"choking eyes,\" meaning\\nvery prominent--\"Mrs. Jellyby is a benefactor to society and deserves\\na helping hand. My boys have contributed to the African\\nproject--Egbert, one and six, being the entire allowance of nine\\nweeks; Oswald, one and a penny halfpenny, being the same; the rest,\\naccording to their little means. Nevertheless, I do not go with Mrs.\\nJellyby in all things. I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in her treatment\\nof her young family. It has been noticed. It has been observed that\\nher young family are excluded from participation in the objects to\\nwhich she is devoted. She may be right, she may be wrong; but, right\\nor wrong, this is not my course with MY young family. I take them\\neverywhere.\"\\n\\nI was afterwards convinced (and so was Ada) that from the\\nill-conditioned eldest child, these words extorted a sharp yell. He\\nturned it off into a yawn, but it began as a yell.\\n\\n\"They attend matins with me (very prettily done) at half-past six\\no\\'clock in the morning all the year round, including of course the\\ndepth of winter,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle rapidly, \"and they are with me\\nduring the revolving duties of the day. I am a School lady, I am a\\nVisiting lady, I am a Reading lady, I am a Distributing lady; I am on\\nthe local Linen Box Committee and many general committees; and my\\ncanvassing alone is very extensive--perhaps no one\\'s more so. But\\nthey are my companions everywhere; and by these means they acquire\\nthat knowledge of the poor, and that capacity of doing charitable\\nbusiness in general--in short, that taste for the sort of\\nthing--which will render them in after life a service to their\\nneighbours and a satisfaction to themselves. My young family are not\\nfrivolous; they expend the entire amount of their allowance in\\nsubscriptions, under my direction; and they have attended as many\\npublic meetings and listened to as many lectures, orations, and\\ndiscussions as generally fall to the lot of few grown people. Alfred\\n(five), who, as I mentioned, has of his own election joined the\\nInfant Bonds of Joy, was one of the very few children who manifested\\nconsciousness on that occasion after a fervid address of two hours\\nfrom the chairman of the evening.\"\\n\\nAlfred glowered at us as if he never could, or would, forgive the\\ninjury of that night.\\n\\n\"You may have observed, Miss Summerson,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"in\\nsome of the lists to which I have referred, in the possession of our\\nesteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce, that the names of my young family are\\nconcluded with the name of O. A. Pardiggle, F.R.S., one pound. That\\nis their father. We usually observe the same routine. I put down my\\nmite first; then my young family enrol their contributions, according\\nto their ages and their little means; and then Mr. Pardiggle brings\\nup the rear. Mr. Pardiggle is happy to throw in his limited donation,\\nunder my direction; and thus things are made not only pleasant to\\nourselves, but, we trust, improving to others.\"\\n\\nSuppose Mr. Pardiggle were to dine with Mr. Jellyby, and suppose Mr.\\nJellyby were to relieve his mind after dinner to Mr. Pardiggle, would\\nMr. Pardiggle, in return, make any confidential communication to Mr.\\nJellyby? I was quite confused to find myself thinking this, but it\\ncame into my head.\\n\\n\"You are very pleasantly situated here!\" said Mrs. Pardiggle.\\n\\nWe were glad to change the subject, and going to the window, pointed\\nout the beauties of the prospect, on which the spectacles appeared to\\nme to rest with curious indifference.\\n\\n\"You know Mr. Gusher?\" said our visitor.\\n\\nWe were obliged to say that we had not the pleasure of Mr. Gusher\\'s\\nacquaintance.\\n\\n\"The loss is yours, I assure you,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle with her\\ncommanding deportment. \"He is a very fervid, impassioned\\nspeaker--full of fire! Stationed in a waggon on this lawn, now,\\nwhich, from the shape of the land, is naturally adapted to a public\\nmeeting, he would improve almost any occasion you could mention for\\nhours and hours! By this time, young ladies,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle,\\nmoving back to her chair and overturning, as if by invisible agency,\\na little round table at a considerable distance with my work-basket\\non it, \"by this time you have found me out, I dare say?\"\\n\\nThis was really such a confusing question that Ada looked at me in\\nperfect dismay. As to the guilty nature of my own consciousness after\\nwhat I had been thinking, it must have been expressed in the colour\\nof my cheeks.\\n\\n\"Found out, I mean,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"the prominent point in my\\ncharacter. I am aware that it is so prominent as to be discoverable\\nimmediately. I lay myself open to detection, I know. Well! I freely\\nadmit, I am a woman of business. I love hard work; I enjoy hard work.\\nThe excitement does me good. I am so accustomed and inured to hard\\nwork that I don\\'t know what fatigue is.\"\\n\\nWe murmured that it was very astonishing and very gratifying, or\\nsomething to that effect. I don\\'t think we knew what it was either,\\nbut this is what our politeness expressed.\\n\\n\"I do not understand what it is to be tired; you cannot tire me if\\nyou try!\" said Mrs. Pardiggle. \"The quantity of exertion (which is no\\nexertion to me), the amount of business (which I regard as nothing),\\nthat I go through sometimes astonishes myself. I have seen my young\\nfamily, and Mr. Pardiggle, quite worn out with witnessing it, when I\\nmay truly say I have been as fresh as a lark!\"\\n\\nIf that dark-visaged eldest boy could look more malicious than he had\\nalready looked, this was the time when he did it. I observed that he\\ndoubled his right fist and delivered a secret blow into the crown of\\nhis cap, which was under his left arm.\\n\\n\"This gives me a great advantage when I am making my rounds,\" said\\nMrs. Pardiggle. \"If I find a person unwilling to hear what I have to\\nsay, I tell that person directly, \\'I am incapable of fatigue, my good\\nfriend, I am never tired, and I mean to go on until I have done.\\' It\\nanswers admirably! Miss Summerson, I hope I shall have your\\nassistance in my visiting rounds immediately, and Miss Clare\\'s very\\nsoon.\"\\n\\nAt first I tried to excuse myself for the present on the general\\nground of having occupations to attend to which I must not neglect.\\nBut as this was an ineffectual protest, I then said, more\\nparticularly, that I was not sure of my qualifications. That I was\\ninexperienced in the art of adapting my mind to minds very\\ndifferently situated, and addressing them from suitable points of\\nview. That I had not that delicate knowledge of the heart which must\\nbe essential to such a work. That I had much to learn, myself, before\\nI could teach others, and that I could not confide in my good\\nintentions alone. For these reasons I thought it best to be as useful\\nas I could, and to render what kind services I could to those\\nimmediately about me, and to try to let that circle of duty gradually\\nand naturally expand itself. All this I said with anything but\\nconfidence, because Mrs. Pardiggle was much older than I, and had\\ngreat experience, and was so very military in her manners.\\n\\n\"You are wrong, Miss Summerson,\" said she, \"but perhaps you are not\\nequal to hard work or the excitement of it, and that makes a vast\\ndifference. If you would like to see how I go through my work, I am\\nnow about--with my young family--to visit a brickmaker in the\\nneighbourhood (a very bad character) and shall be glad to take you\\nwith me. Miss Clare also, if she will do me the favour.\"\\n\\nAda and I interchanged looks, and as we were going out in any case,\\naccepted the offer. When we hastily returned from putting on our\\nbonnets, we found the young family languishing in a corner and Mrs.\\nPardiggle sweeping about the room, knocking down nearly all the light\\nobjects it contained. Mrs. Pardiggle took possession of Ada, and I\\nfollowed with the family.\\n\\nAda told me afterwards that Mrs. Pardiggle talked in the same loud\\ntone (that, indeed, I overheard) all the way to the brickmaker\\'s\\nabout an exciting contest which she had for two or three years waged\\nagainst another lady relative to the bringing in of their rival\\ncandidates for a pension somewhere. There had been a quantity of\\nprinting, and promising, and proxying, and polling, and it appeared\\nto have imparted great liveliness to all concerned, except the\\npensioners--who were not elected yet.\\n\\nI am very fond of being confided in by children and am happy in being\\nusually favoured in that respect, but on this occasion it gave me\\ngreat uneasiness. As soon as we were out of doors, Egbert, with the\\nmanner of a little footpad, demanded a shilling of me on the ground\\nthat his pocket-money was \"boned\" from him. On my pointing out the\\ngreat impropriety of the word, especially in connexion with his\\nparent (for he added sulkily \"By her!\"), he pinched me and said, \"Oh,\\nthen! Now! Who are you! YOU wouldn\\'t like it, I think? What does she\\nmake a sham for, and pretend to give me money, and take it away\\nagain? Why do you call it my allowance, and never let me spend it?\"\\nThese exasperating questions so inflamed his mind and the minds of\\nOswald and Francis that they all pinched me at once, and in a\\ndreadfully expert way--screwing up such little pieces of my arms that\\nI could hardly forbear crying out. Felix, at the same time, stamped\\nupon my toes. And the Bond of Joy, who on account of always having\\nthe whole of his little income anticipated stood in fact pledged to\\nabstain from cakes as well as tobacco, so swelled with grief and rage\\nwhen we passed a pastry-cook\\'s shop that he terrified me by becoming\\npurple. I never underwent so much, both in body and mind, in the\\ncourse of a walk with young people as from these unnaturally\\nconstrained children when they paid me the compliment of being\\nnatural.\\n\\nI was glad when we came to the brickmaker\\'s house, though it was one\\nof a cluster of wretched hovels in a brick-field, with pigsties close\\nto the broken windows and miserable little gardens before the doors\\ngrowing nothing but stagnant pools. Here and there an old tub was put\\nto catch the droppings of rain-water from a roof, or they were banked\\nup with mud into a little pond like a large dirt-pie. At the doors\\nand windows some men and women lounged or prowled about, and took\\nlittle notice of us except to laugh to one another or to say\\nsomething as we passed about gentlefolks minding their own business\\nand not troubling their heads and muddying their shoes with coming to\\nlook after other people\\'s.\\n\\nMrs. Pardiggle, leading the way with a great show of moral\\ndetermination and talking with much volubility about the untidy\\nhabits of the people (though I doubted if the best of us could have\\nbeen tidy in such a place), conducted us into a cottage at the\\nfarthest corner, the ground-floor room of which we nearly filled.\\nBesides ourselves, there were in this damp, offensive room a woman\\nwith a black eye, nursing a poor little gasping baby by the fire; a\\nman, all stained with clay and mud and looking very dissipated, lying\\nat full length on the ground, smoking a pipe; a powerful young man\\nfastening a collar on a dog; and a bold girl doing some kind of\\nwashing in very dirty water. They all looked up at us as we came in,\\nand the woman seemed to turn her face towards the fire as if to hide\\nher bruised eye; nobody gave us any welcome.\\n\\n\"Well, my friends,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, but her voice had not a\\nfriendly sound, I thought; it was much too business-like and\\nsystematic. \"How do you do, all of you? I am here again. I told you,\\nyou couldn\\'t tire me, you know. I am fond of hard work, and am true\\nto my word.\"\\n\\n\"There an\\'t,\" growled the man on the floor, whose head rested on his\\nhand as he stared at us, \"any more on you to come in, is there?\"\\n\\n\"No, my friend,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, seating herself on one stool\\nand knocking down another. \"We are all here.\"\\n\\n\"Because I thought there warn\\'t enough of you, perhaps?\" said the\\nman, with his pipe between his lips as he looked round upon us.\\n\\nThe young man and the girl both laughed. Two friends of the young\\nman, whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with\\ntheir hands in their pockets, echoed the laugh noisily.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t tire me, good people,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle to these\\nlatter. \"I enjoy hard work, and the harder you make mine, the better\\nI like it.\"\\n\\n\"Then make it easy for her!\" growled the man upon the floor. \"I wants\\nit done, and over. I wants a end of these liberties took with my\\nplace. I wants an end of being drawed like a badger. Now you\\'re\\na-going to poll-pry and question according to custom--I know what\\nyou\\'re a-going to be up to. Well! You haven\\'t got no occasion to be\\nup to it. I\\'ll save you the trouble. Is my daughter a-washin? Yes,\\nshe IS a-washin. Look at the water. Smell it! That\\'s wot we drinks.\\nHow do you like it, and what do you think of gin instead! An\\'t my\\nplace dirty? Yes, it is dirty--it\\'s nat\\'rally dirty, and it\\'s\\nnat\\'rally onwholesome; and we\\'ve had five dirty and onwholesome\\nchildren, as is all dead infants, and so much the better for them,\\nand for us besides. Have I read the little book wot you left? No, I\\nan\\'t read the little book wot you left. There an\\'t nobody here as\\nknows how to read it; and if there wos, it wouldn\\'t be suitable to\\nme. It\\'s a book fit for a babby, and I\\'m not a babby. If you was to\\nleave me a doll, I shouldn\\'t nuss it. How have I been conducting of\\nmyself? Why, I\\'ve been drunk for three days; and I\\'da been drunk four\\nif I\\'da had the money. Don\\'t I never mean for to go to church? No, I\\ndon\\'t never mean for to go to church. I shouldn\\'t be expected there,\\nif I did; the beadle\\'s too gen-teel for me. And how did my wife get\\nthat black eye? Why, I give it her; and if she says I didn\\'t, she\\'s a\\nlie!\"\\n\\nHe had pulled his pipe out of his mouth to say all this, and he now\\nturned over on his other side and smoked again. Mrs. Pardiggle, who\\nhad been regarding him through her spectacles with a forcible\\ncomposure, calculated, I could not help thinking, to increase his\\nantagonism, pulled out a good book as if it were a constable\\'s staff\\nand took the whole family into custody. I mean into religious\\ncustody, of course; but she really did it as if she were an\\ninexorable moral policeman carrying them all off to a station-house.\\n\\nAda and I were very uncomfortable. We both felt intrusive and out of\\nplace, and we both thought that Mrs. Pardiggle would have got on\\ninfinitely better if she had not had such a mechanical way of taking\\npossession of people. The children sulked and stared; the family took\\nno notice of us whatever, except when the young man made the dog\\nbark, which he usually did when Mrs. Pardiggle was most emphatic. We\\nboth felt painfully sensible that between us and these people there\\nwas an iron barrier which could not be removed by our new friend. By\\nwhom or how it could be removed, we did not know, but we knew that.\\nEven what she read and said seemed to us to be ill-chosen for such\\nauditors, if it had been imparted ever so modestly and with ever so\\nmuch tact. As to the little book to which the man on the floor had\\nreferred, we acquired a knowledge of it afterwards, and Mr. Jarndyce\\nsaid he doubted if Robinson Crusoe could have read it, though he had\\nhad no other on his desolate island.\\n\\nWe were much relieved, under these circumstances, when Mrs. Pardiggle\\nleft off.\\n\\nThe man on the floor, then turning his head round again, said\\nmorosely, \"Well! You\\'ve done, have you?\"\\n\\n\"For to-day, I have, my friend. But I am never fatigued. I shall come\\nto you again in your regular order,\" returned Mrs. Pardiggle with\\ndemonstrative cheerfulness.\\n\\n\"So long as you goes now,\" said he, folding his arms and shutting his\\neyes with an oath, \"you may do wot you like!\"\\n\\nMrs. Pardiggle accordingly rose and made a little vortex in the\\nconfined room from which the pipe itself very narrowly escaped.\\nTaking one of her young family in each hand, and telling the others\\nto follow closely, and expressing her hope that the brickmaker and\\nall his house would be improved when she saw them next, she then\\nproceeded to another cottage. I hope it is not unkind in me to say\\nthat she certainly did make, in this as in everything else, a show\\nthat was not conciliatory of doing charity by wholesale and of\\ndealing in it to a large extent.\\n\\nShe supposed that we were following her, but as soon as the space was\\nleft clear, we approached the woman sitting by the fire to ask if the\\nbaby were ill.\\n\\nShe only looked at it as it lay on her lap. We had observed before\\nthat when she looked at it she covered her discoloured eye with her\\nhand, as though she wished to separate any association with noise and\\nviolence and ill treatment from the poor little child.\\n\\nAda, whose gentle heart was moved by its appearance, bent down to\\ntouch its little face. As she did so, I saw what happened and drew\\nher back. The child died.\\n\\n\"Oh, Esther!\" cried Ada, sinking on her knees beside it. \"Look here!\\nOh, Esther, my love, the little thing! The suffering, quiet, pretty\\nlittle thing! I am so sorry for it. I am so sorry for the mother. I\\nnever saw a sight so pitiful as this before! Oh, baby, baby!\"\\n\\nSuch compassion, such gentleness, as that with which she bent down\\nweeping and put her hand upon the mother\\'s might have softened any\\nmother\\'s heart that ever beat. The woman at first gazed at her in\\nastonishment and then burst into tears.\\n\\nPresently I took the light burden from her lap, did what I could to\\nmake the baby\\'s rest the prettier and gentler, laid it on a shelf,\\nand covered it with my own handkerchief. We tried to comfort the\\nmother, and we whispered to her what Our Saviour said of children.\\nShe answered nothing, but sat weeping--weeping very much.\\n\\nWhen I turned, I found that the young man had taken out the dog and\\nwas standing at the door looking in upon us with dry eyes, but quiet.\\nThe girl was quiet too and sat in a corner looking on the ground. The\\nman had risen. He still smoked his pipe with an air of defiance, but\\nhe was silent.\\n\\nAn ugly woman, very poorly clothed, hurried in while I was glancing\\nat them, and coming straight up to the mother, said, \"Jenny! Jenny!\"\\nThe mother rose on being so addressed and fell upon the woman\\'s neck.\\n\\nShe also had upon her face and arms the marks of ill usage. She had\\nno kind of grace about her, but the grace of sympathy; but when she\\ncondoled with the woman, and her own tears fell, she wanted no\\nbeauty. I say condoled, but her only words were \"Jenny! Jenny!\" All\\nthe rest was in the tone in which she said them.\\n\\nI thought it very touching to see these two women, coarse and shabby\\nand beaten, so united; to see what they could be to one another; to\\nsee how they felt for one another, how the heart of each to each was\\nsoftened by the hard trials of their lives. I think the best side of\\nsuch people is almost hidden from us. What the poor are to the poor\\nis little known, excepting to themselves and God.\\n\\nWe felt it better to withdraw and leave them uninterrupted. We stole\\nout quietly and without notice from any one except the man. He was\\nleaning against the wall near the door, and finding that there was\\nscarcely room for us to pass, went out before us. He seemed to want\\nto hide that he did this on our account, but we perceived that he\\ndid, and thanked him. He made no answer.\\n\\nAda was so full of grief all the way home, and Richard, whom we found\\nat home, was so distressed to see her in tears (though he said to me,\\nwhen she was not present, how beautiful it was too!), that we\\narranged to return at night with some little comforts and repeat our\\nvisit at the brick-maker\\'s house. We said as little as we could to\\nMr. Jarndyce, but the wind changed directly.\\n\\nRichard accompanied us at night to the scene of our morning\\nexpedition. On our way there, we had to pass a noisy drinking-house,\\nwhere a number of men were flocking about the door. Among them, and\\nprominent in some dispute, was the father of the little child. At a\\nshort distance, we passed the young man and the dog, in congenial\\ncompany. The sister was standing laughing and talking with some other\\nyoung women at the corner of the row of cottages, but she seemed\\nashamed and turned away as we went by.\\n\\nWe left our escort within sight of the brickmaker\\'s dwelling and\\nproceeded by ourselves. When we came to the door, we found the woman\\nwho had brought such consolation with her standing there looking\\nanxiously out.\\n\\n\"It\\'s you, young ladies, is it?\" she said in a whisper. \"I\\'m\\na-watching for my master. My heart\\'s in my mouth. If he was to catch\\nme away from home, he\\'d pretty near murder me.\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean your husband?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Yes, miss, my master. Jenny\\'s asleep, quite worn out. She\\'s scarcely\\nhad the child off her lap, poor thing, these seven days and nights,\\nexcept when I\\'ve been able to take it for a minute or two.\"\\n\\nAs she gave way for us, she went softly in and put what we had\\nbrought near the miserable bed on which the mother slept. No effort\\nhad been made to clean the room--it seemed in its nature almost\\nhopeless of being clean; but the small waxen form from which so much\\nsolemnity diffused itself had been composed afresh, and washed, and\\nneatly dressed in some fragments of white linen; and on my\\nhandkerchief, which still covered the poor baby, a little bunch of\\nsweet herbs had been laid by the same rough, scarred hands, so\\nlightly, so tenderly!\\n\\n\"May heaven reward you!\" we said to her. \"You are a good woman.\"\\n\\n\"Me, young ladies?\" she returned with surprise. \"Hush! Jenny, Jenny!\"\\n\\nThe mother had moaned in her sleep and moved. The sound of the\\nfamiliar voice seemed to calm her again. She was quiet once more.\\n\\nHow little I thought, when I raised my handkerchief to look upon the\\ntiny sleeper underneath and seemed to see a halo shine around the\\nchild through Ada\\'s drooping hair as her pity bent her head--how\\nlittle I thought in whose unquiet bosom that handkerchief would come\\nto lie after covering the motionless and peaceful breast! I only\\nthought that perhaps the Angel of the child might not be all\\nunconscious of the woman who replaced it with so compassionate a\\nhand; not all unconscious of her presently, when we had taken leave,\\nand left her at the door, by turns looking, and listening in terror\\nfor herself, and saying in her old soothing manner, \"Jenny, Jenny!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know how it is I seem to be always writing about myself. I\\nmean all the time to write about other people, and I try to think\\nabout myself as little as possible, and I am sure, when I find myself\\ncoming into the story again, I am really vexed and say, \"Dear, dear,\\nyou tiresome little creature, I wish you wouldn\\'t!\" but it is all of\\nno use. I hope any one who may read what I write will understand that\\nif these pages contain a great deal about me, I can only suppose it\\nmust be because I have really something to do with them and can\\'t be\\nkept out.\\n\\nMy darling and I read together, and worked, and practised, and found\\nso much employment for our time that the winter days flew by us like\\nbright-winged birds. Generally in the afternoons, and always in the\\nevenings, Richard gave us his company. Although he was one of the\\nmost restless creatures in the world, he certainly was very fond of\\nour society.\\n\\nHe was very, very, very fond of Ada. I mean it, and I had better say\\nit at once. I had never seen any young people falling in love before,\\nbut I found them out quite soon. I could not say so, of course, or\\nshow that I knew anything about it. On the contrary, I was so demure\\nand used to seem so unconscious that sometimes I considered within\\nmyself while I was sitting at work whether I was not growing quite\\ndeceitful.\\n\\nBut there was no help for it. All I had to do was to be quiet, and I\\nwas as quiet as a mouse. They were as quiet as mice too, so far as\\nany words were concerned, but the innocent manner in which they\\nrelied more and more upon me as they took more and more to one\\nanother was so charming that I had great difficulty in not showing\\nhow it interested me.\\n\\n\"Our dear little old woman is such a capital old woman,\" Richard\\nwould say, coming up to meet me in the garden early, with his\\npleasant laugh and perhaps the least tinge of a blush, \"that I can\\'t\\nget on without her. Before I begin my harum-scarum day--grinding away\\nat those books and instruments and then galloping up hill and down\\ndale, all the country round, like a highwayman--it does me so much\\ngood to come and have a steady walk with our comfortable friend, that\\nhere I am again!\"\\n\\n\"You know, Dame Durden, dear,\" Ada would say at night, with her head\\nupon my shoulder and the firelight shining in her thoughtful eyes, \"I\\ndon\\'t want to talk when we come upstairs here. Only to sit a little\\nwhile thinking, with your dear face for company, and to hear the wind\\nand remember the poor sailors at sea--\"\\n\\nAh! Perhaps Richard was going to be a sailor. We had talked it over\\nvery often now, and there was some talk of gratifying the inclination\\nof his childhood for the sea. Mr. Jarndyce had written to a relation\\nof the family, a great Sir Leicester Dedlock, for his interest in\\nRichard\\'s favour, generally; and Sir Leicester had replied in a\\ngracious manner that he would be happy to advance the prospects of\\nthe young gentleman if it should ever prove to be within his power,\\nwhich was not at all probable, and that my Lady sent her compliments\\nto the young gentleman (to whom she perfectly remembered that she was\\nallied by remote consanguinity) and trusted that he would ever do his\\nduty in any honourable profession to which he might devote himself.\\n\\n\"So I apprehend it\\'s pretty clear,\" said Richard to me, \"that I shall\\nhave to work my own way. Never mind! Plenty of people have had to do\\nthat before now, and have done it. I only wish I had the command of a\\nclipping privateer to begin with and could carry off the Chancellor\\nand keep him on short allowance until he gave judgment in our cause.\\nHe\\'d find himself growing thin, if he didn\\'t look sharp!\"\\n\\nWith a buoyancy and hopefulness and a gaiety that hardly ever\\nflagged, Richard had a carelessness in his character that quite\\nperplexed me, principally because he mistook it, in such a very odd\\nway, for prudence. It entered into all his calculations about money\\nin a singular manner which I don\\'t think I can better explain than by\\nreverting for a moment to our loan to Mr. Skimpole.\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce had ascertained the amount, either from Mr. Skimpole\\nhimself or from Coavinses, and had placed the money in my hands with\\ninstructions to me to retain my own part of it and hand the rest to\\nRichard. The number of little acts of thoughtless expenditure which\\nRichard justified by the recovery of his ten pounds, and the number\\nof times he talked to me as if he had saved or realized that amount,\\nwould form a sum in simple addition.\\n\\n\"My prudent Mother Hubbard, why not?\" he said to me when he wanted,\\nwithout the least consideration, to bestow five pounds on the\\nbrickmaker. \"I made ten pounds, clear, out of Coavinses\\' business.\"\\n\\n\"How was that?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Why, I got rid of ten pounds which I was quite content to get rid of\\nand never expected to see any more. You don\\'t deny that?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Very well! Then I came into possession of ten pounds--\"\\n\\n\"The same ten pounds,\" I hinted.\\n\\n\"That has nothing to do with it!\" returned Richard. \"I have got ten\\npounds more than I expected to have, and consequently I can afford to\\nspend it without being particular.\"\\n\\nIn exactly the same way, when he was persuaded out of the sacrifice\\nof these five pounds by being convinced that it would do no good, he\\ncarried that sum to his credit and drew upon it.\\n\\n\"Let me see!\" he would say. \"I saved five pounds out of the\\nbrickmaker\\'s affair, so if I have a good rattle to London and back in\\na post-chaise and put that down at four pounds, I shall have saved\\none. And it\\'s a very good thing to save one, let me tell you: a penny\\nsaved is a penny got!\"\\n\\nI believe Richard\\'s was as frank and generous a nature as there\\npossibly can be. He was ardent and brave, and in the midst of all his\\nwild restlessness, was so gentle that I knew him like a brother in a\\nfew weeks. His gentleness was natural to him and would have shown\\nitself abundantly even without Ada\\'s influence; but with it, he\\nbecame one of the most winning of companions, always so ready to be\\ninterested and always so happy, sanguine, and light-hearted. I am\\nsure that I, sitting with them, and walking with them, and talking\\nwith them, and noticing from day to day how they went on, falling\\ndeeper and deeper in love, and saying nothing about it, and each\\nshyly thinking that this love was the greatest of secrets, perhaps\\nnot yet suspected even by the other--I am sure that I was scarcely\\nless enchanted than they were and scarcely less pleased with the\\npretty dream.\\n\\nWe were going on in this way, when one morning at breakfast Mr.\\nJarndyce received a letter, and looking at the superscription, said,\\n\"From Boythorn? Aye, aye!\" and opened and read it with evident\\npleasure, announcing to us in a parenthesis when he was about\\nhalf-way through, that Boythorn was \"coming down\" on a visit. Now who\\nwas Boythorn, we all thought. And I dare say we all thought too--I am\\nsure I did, for one--would Boythorn at all interfere with what was\\ngoing forward?\\n\\n\"I went to school with this fellow, Lawrence Boythorn,\" said Mr.\\nJarndyce, tapping the letter as he laid it on the table, \"more than\\nfive and forty years ago. He was then the most impetuous boy in the\\nworld, and he is now the most impetuous man. He was then the loudest\\nboy in the world, and he is now the loudest man. He was then the\\nheartiest and sturdiest boy in the world, and he is now the heartiest\\nand sturdiest man. He is a tremendous fellow.\"\\n\\n\"In stature, sir?\" asked Richard.\\n\\n\"Pretty well, Rick, in that respect,\" said Mr. Jarndyce; \"being some\\nten years older than I and a couple of inches taller, with his head\\nthrown back like an old soldier, his stalwart chest squared, his\\nhands like a clean blacksmith\\'s, and his lungs! There\\'s no simile for\\nhis lungs. Talking, laughing, or snoring, they make the beams of the\\nhouse shake.\"\\n\\nAs Mr. Jarndyce sat enjoying the image of his friend Boythorn, we\\nobserved the favourable omen that there was not the least indication\\nof any change in the wind.\\n\\n\"But it\\'s the inside of the man, the warm heart of the man, the\\npassion of the man, the fresh blood of the man, Rick--and Ada, and\\nlittle Cobweb too, for you are all interested in a visitor--that I\\nspeak of,\" he pursued. \"His language is as sounding as his voice. He\\nis always in extremes, perpetually in the superlative degree. In his\\ncondemnation he is all ferocity. You might suppose him to be an ogre\\nfrom what he says, and I believe he has the reputation of one with\\nsome people. There! I tell you no more of him beforehand. You must\\nnot be surprised to see him take me under his protection, for he has\\nnever forgotten that I was a low boy at school and that our\\nfriendship began in his knocking two of my head tyrant\\'s teeth out\\n(he says six) before breakfast. Boythorn and his man,\" to me, \"will\\nbe here this afternoon, my dear.\"\\n\\nI took care that the necessary preparations were made for Mr.\\nBoythorn\\'s reception, and we looked forward to his arrival with some\\ncuriosity. The afternoon wore away, however, and he did not appear.\\nThe dinner-hour arrived, and still he did not appear. The dinner was\\nput back an hour, and we were sitting round the fire with no light\\nbut the blaze when the hall-door suddenly burst open and the hall\\nresounded with these words, uttered with the greatest vehemence and\\nin a stentorian tone: \"We have been misdirected, Jarndyce, by a most\\nabandoned ruffian, who told us to take the turning to the right\\ninstead of to the left. He is the most intolerable scoundrel on the\\nface of the earth. His father must have been a most consummate\\nvillain, ever to have such a son. I would have had that fellow shot\\nwithout the least remorse!\"\\n\\n\"Did he do it on purpose?\" Mr. Jarndyce inquired.\\n\\n\"I have not the slightest doubt that the scoundrel has passed his\\nwhole existence in misdirecting travellers!\" returned the other. \"By\\nmy soul, I thought him the worst-looking dog I had ever beheld when\\nhe was telling me to take the turning to the right. And yet I stood\\nbefore that fellow face to face and didn\\'t knock his brains out!\"\\n\\n\"Teeth, you mean?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, really making the whole\\nhouse vibrate. \"What, you have not forgotten it yet! Ha, ha, ha! And\\nthat was another most consummate vagabond! By my soul, the\\ncountenance of that fellow when he was a boy was the blackest image\\nof perfidy, cowardice, and cruelty ever set up as a scarecrow in a\\nfield of scoundrels. If I were to meet that most unparalleled despot\\nin the streets to-morrow, I would fell him like a rotten tree!\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"Now, will you come\\nupstairs?\"\\n\\n\"By my soul, Jarndyce,\" returned his guest, who seemed to refer to\\nhis watch, \"if you had been married, I would have turned back at the\\ngarden-gate and gone away to the remotest summits of the Himalaya\\nMountains sooner than I would have presented myself at this\\nunseasonable hour.\"\\n\\n\"Not quite so far, I hope?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"By my life and honour, yes!\" cried the visitor. \"I wouldn\\'t be\\nguilty of the audacious insolence of keeping a lady of the house\\nwaiting all this time for any earthly consideration. I would\\ninfinitely rather destroy myself--infinitely rather!\"\\n\\nTalking thus, they went upstairs, and presently we heard him in his\\nbedroom thundering \"Ha, ha, ha!\" and again \"Ha, ha, ha!\" until the\\nflattest echo in the neighbourhood seemed to catch the contagion and\\nto laugh as enjoyingly as he did or as we did when we heard him\\nlaugh.\\n\\nWe all conceived a prepossession in his favour, for there was a\\nsterling quality in this laugh, and in his vigorous, healthy voice,\\nand in the roundness and fullness with which he uttered every word he\\nspoke, and in the very fury of his superlatives, which seemed to go\\noff like blank cannons and hurt nothing. But we were hardly prepared\\nto have it so confirmed by his appearance when Mr. Jarndyce presented\\nhim. He was not only a very handsome old gentleman--upright and\\nstalwart as he had been described to us--with a massive grey head, a\\nfine composure of face when silent, a figure that might have become\\ncorpulent but for his being so continually in earnest that he gave it\\nno rest, and a chin that might have subsided into a double chin but\\nfor the vehement emphasis in which it was constantly required to\\nassist; but he was such a true gentleman in his manner, so\\nchivalrously polite, his face was lighted by a smile of so much\\nsweetness and tenderness, and it seemed so plain that he had nothing\\nto hide, but showed himself exactly as he was--incapable, as Richard\\nsaid, of anything on a limited scale, and firing away with those\\nblank great guns because he carried no small arms whatever--that\\nreally I could not help looking at him with equal pleasure as he sat\\nat dinner, whether he smilingly conversed with Ada and me, or was led\\nby Mr. Jarndyce into some great volley of superlatives, or threw up\\nhis head like a bloodhound and gave out that tremendous \"Ha, ha, ha!\"\\n\\n\"You have brought your bird with you, I suppose?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"By heaven, he is the most astonishing bird in Europe!\" replied the\\nother. \"He IS the most wonderful creature! I wouldn\\'t take ten\\nthousand guineas for that bird. I have left an annuity for his sole\\nsupport in case he should outlive me. He is, in sense and attachment,\\na phenomenon. And his father before him was one of the most\\nastonishing birds that ever lived!\"\\n\\nThe subject of this laudation was a very little canary, who was so\\ntame that he was brought down by Mr. Boythorn\\'s man, on his\\nforefinger, and after taking a gentle flight round the room, alighted\\non his master\\'s head. To hear Mr. Boythorn presently expressing the\\nmost implacable and passionate sentiments, with this fragile mite of\\na creature quietly perched on his forehead, was to have a good\\nillustration of his character, I thought.\\n\\n\"By my soul, Jarndyce,\" he said, very gently holding up a bit of\\nbread to the canary to peck at, \"if I were in your place I would\\nseize every master in Chancery by the throat to-morrow morning and\\nshake him until his money rolled out of his pockets and his bones\\nrattled in his skin. I would have a settlement out of somebody, by\\nfair means or by foul. If you would empower me to do it, I would do\\nit for you with the greatest satisfaction!\" (All this time the very\\nsmall canary was eating out of his hand.)\\n\\n\"I thank you, Lawrence, but the suit is hardly at such a point at\\npresent,\" returned Mr. Jarndyce, laughing, \"that it would be greatly\\nadvanced even by the legal process of shaking the bench and the whole\\nbar.\"\\n\\n\"There never was such an infernal cauldron as that Chancery on the\\nface of the earth!\" said Mr. Boythorn. \"Nothing but a mine below it\\non a busy day in term time, with all its records, rules, and\\nprecedents collected in it and every functionary belonging to it\\nalso, high and low, upward and downward, from its son the\\nAccountant-General to its father the Devil, and the whole blown to\\natoms with ten thousand hundredweight of gunpowder, would reform it\\nin the least!\"\\n\\nIt was impossible not to laugh at the energetic gravity with which he\\nrecommended this strong measure of reform. When we laughed, he threw\\nup his head and shook his broad chest, and again the whole country\\nseemed to echo to his \"Ha, ha, ha!\" It had not the least effect in\\ndisturbing the bird, whose sense of security was complete and who\\nhopped about the table with its quick head now on this side and now\\non that, turning its bright sudden eye on its master as if he were no\\nmore than another bird.\\n\\n\"But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right of\\nway?\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"You are not free from the toils of the law\\nyourself!\"\\n\\n\"The fellow has brought actions against ME for trespass, and I have\\nbrought actions against HIM for trespass,\" returned Mr. Boythorn. \"By\\nheaven, he is the proudest fellow breathing. It is morally impossible\\nthat his name can be Sir Leicester. It must be Sir Lucifer.\"\\n\\n\"Complimentary to our distant relation!\" said my guardian laughingly\\nto Ada and Richard.\\n\\n\"I would beg Miss Clare\\'s pardon and Mr. Carstone\\'s pardon,\" resumed\\nour visitor, \"if I were not reassured by seeing in the fair face of\\nthe lady and the smile of the gentleman that it is quite unnecessary\\nand that they keep their distant relation at a comfortable distance.\"\\n\\n\"Or he keeps us,\" suggested Richard.\\n\\n\"By my soul,\" exclaimed Mr. Boythorn, suddenly firing another volley,\\n\"that fellow is, and his father was, and his grandfather was, the\\nmost stiff-necked, arrogant imbecile, pig-headed numskull, ever, by\\nsome inexplicable mistake of Nature, born in any station of life but\\na walking-stick\\'s! The whole of that family are the most solemnly\\nconceited and consummate blockheads! But it\\'s no matter; he should\\nnot shut up my path if he were fifty baronets melted into one and\\nliving in a hundred Chesney Wolds, one within another, like the ivory\\nballs in a Chinese carving. The fellow, by his agent, or secretary,\\nor somebody, writes to me \\'Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, presents\\nhis compliments to Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, and has to call his\\nattention to the fact that the green pathway by the old\\nparsonage-house, now the property of Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, is Sir\\nLeicester\\'s right of way, being in fact a portion of the park of\\nChesney Wold, and that Sir Leicester finds it convenient to close up\\nthe same.\\' I write to the fellow, \\'Mr. Lawrence Boythorn presents his\\ncompliments to Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, and has to call HIS\\nattention to the fact that he totally denies the whole of Sir\\nLeicester Dedlock\\'s positions on every possible subject and has to\\nadd, in reference to closing up the pathway, that he will be glad to\\nsee the man who may undertake to do it.\\' The fellow sends a most\\nabandoned villain with one eye to construct a gateway. I play upon\\nthat execrable scoundrel with a fire-engine until the breath is\\nnearly driven out of his body. The fellow erects a gate in the night.\\nI chop it down and burn it in the morning. He sends his myrmidons to\\ncome over the fence and pass and repass. I catch them in humane man\\ntraps, fire split peas at their legs, play upon them with the\\nengine--resolve to free mankind from the insupportable burden of the\\nexistence of those lurking ruffians. He brings actions for trespass;\\nI bring actions for trespass. He brings actions for assault and\\nbattery; I defend them and continue to assault and batter. Ha, ha,\\nha!\"\\n\\nTo hear him say all this with unimaginable energy, one might have\\nthought him the angriest of mankind. To see him at the very same\\ntime, looking at the bird now perched upon his thumb and softly\\nsmoothing its feathers with his forefinger, one might have thought\\nhim the gentlest. To hear him laugh and see the broad good nature of\\nhis face then, one might have supposed that he had not a care in the\\nworld, or a dispute, or a dislike, but that his whole existence was a\\nsummer joke.\\n\\n\"No, no,\" he said, \"no closing up of my paths by any Dedlock! Though\\nI willingly confess,\" here he softened in a moment, \"that Lady\\nDedlock is the most accomplished lady in the world, to whom I would\\ndo any homage that a plain gentleman, and no baronet with a head\\nseven hundred years thick, may. A man who joined his regiment at\\ntwenty and within a week challenged the most imperious and\\npresumptuous coxcomb of a commanding officer that ever drew the\\nbreath of life through a tight waist--and got broke for it--is not\\nthe man to be walked over by all the Sir Lucifers, dead or alive,\\nlocked or unlocked. Ha, ha, ha!\"\\n\\n\"Nor the man to allow his junior to be walked over either?\" said my\\nguardian.\\n\\n\"Most assuredly not!\" said Mr. Boythorn, clapping him on the shoulder\\nwith an air of protection that had something serious in it, though he\\nlaughed. \"He will stand by the low boy, always. Jarndyce, you may\\nrely upon him! But speaking of this trespass--with apologies to Miss\\nClare and Miss Summerson for the length at which I have pursued so\\ndry a subject--is there nothing for me from your men Kenge and\\nCarboy?\"\\n\\n\"I think not, Esther?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Nothing, guardian.\"\\n\\n\"Much obliged!\" said Mr. Boythorn. \"Had no need to ask, after even my\\nslight experience of Miss Summerson\\'s forethought for every one about\\nher.\" (They all encouraged me; they were determined to do it.) \"I\\ninquired because, coming from Lincolnshire, I of course have not yet\\nbeen in town, and I thought some letters might have been sent down\\nhere. I dare say they will report progress to-morrow morning.\"\\n\\nI saw him so often in the course of the evening, which passed very\\npleasantly, contemplate Richard and Ada with an interest and a\\nsatisfaction that made his fine face remarkably agreeable as he sat\\nat a little distance from the piano listening to the music--and he\\nhad small occasion to tell us that he was passionately fond of music,\\nfor his face showed it--that I asked my guardian as we sat at the\\nbackgammon board whether Mr. Boythorn had ever been married.\\n\\n\"No,\" said he. \"No.\"\\n\\n\"But he meant to be!\" said I.\\n\\n\"How did you find out that?\" he returned with a smile. \"Why,\\nguardian,\" I explained, not without reddening a little at hazarding\\nwhat was in my thoughts, \"there is something so tender in his manner,\\nafter all, and he is so very courtly and gentle to us, and--\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce directed his eyes to where he was sitting as I have just\\ndescribed him.\\n\\nI said no more.\\n\\n\"You are right, little woman,\" he answered. \"He was all but married\\nonce. Long ago. And once.\"\\n\\n\"Did the lady die?\"\\n\\n\"No--but she died to him. That time has had its influence on all his\\nlater life. Would you suppose him to have a head and a heart full of\\nromance yet?\"\\n\\n\"I think, guardian, I might have supposed so. But it is easy to say\\nthat when you have told me so.\"\\n\\n\"He has never since been what he might have been,\" said Mr. Jarndyce,\\n\"and now you see him in his age with no one near him but his servant\\nand his little yellow friend. It\\'s your throw, my dear!\"\\n\\nI felt, from my guardian\\'s manner, that beyond this point I could not\\npursue the subject without changing the wind. I therefore forbore to\\nask any further questions. I was interested, but not curious. I\\nthought a little while about this old love story in the night, when I\\nwas awakened by Mr. Boythorn\\'s lusty snoring; and I tried to do that\\nvery difficult thing, imagine old people young again and invested\\nwith the graces of youth. But I fell asleep before I had succeeded,\\nand dreamed of the days when I lived in my godmother\\'s house. I am\\nnot sufficiently acquainted with such subjects to know whether it is\\nat all remarkable that I almost always dreamed of that period of my\\nlife.\\n\\nWith the morning there came a letter from Messrs. Kenge and Carboy to\\nMr. Boythorn informing him that one of their clerks would wait upon\\nhim at noon. As it was the day of the week on which I paid the bills,\\nand added up my books, and made all the household affairs as compact\\nas possible, I remained at home while Mr. Jarndyce, Ada, and Richard\\ntook advantage of a very fine day to make a little excursion, Mr.\\nBoythorn was to wait for Kenge and Carboy\\'s clerk and then was to go\\non foot to meet them on their return.\\n\\nWell! I was full of business, examining tradesmen\\'s books, adding up\\ncolumns, paying money, filing receipts, and I dare say making a great\\nbustle about it when Mr. Guppy was announced and shown in. I had had\\nsome idea that the clerk who was to be sent down might be the young\\ngentleman who had met me at the coach-office, and I was glad to see\\nhim, because he was associated with my present happiness.\\n\\nI scarcely knew him again, he was so uncommonly smart. He had an\\nentirely new suit of glossy clothes on, a shining hat, lilac-kid\\ngloves, a neckerchief of a variety of colours, a large hot-house\\nflower in his button-hole, and a thick gold ring on his little\\nfinger. Besides which, he quite scented the dining-room with\\nbear\\'s-grease and other perfumery. He looked at me with an attention\\nthat quite confused me when I begged him to take a seat until the\\nservant should return; and as he sat there crossing and uncrossing\\nhis legs in a corner, and I asked him if he had had a pleasant ride,\\nand hoped that Mr. Kenge was well, I never looked at him, but I found\\nhim looking at me in the same scrutinizing and curious way.\\n\\nWhen the request was brought to him that he would go upstairs to Mr.\\nBoythorn\\'s room, I mentioned that he would find lunch prepared for\\nhim when he came down, of which Mr. Jarndyce hoped he would partake.\\nHe said with some embarrassment, holding the handle of the door,\\n\"Shall I have the honour of finding you here, miss?\" I replied yes, I\\nshould be there; and he went out with a bow and another look.\\n\\nI thought him only awkward and shy, for he was evidently much\\nembarrassed; and I fancied that the best thing I could do would be to\\nwait until I saw that he had everything he wanted and then to leave\\nhim to himself. The lunch was soon brought, but it remained for some\\ntime on the table. The interview with Mr. Boythorn was a long one,\\nand a stormy one too, I should think, for although his room was at\\nsome distance I heard his loud voice rising every now and then like a\\nhigh wind, and evidently blowing perfect broadsides of denunciation.\\n\\nAt last Mr. Guppy came back, looking something the worse for the\\nconference. \"My eye, miss,\" he said in a low voice, \"he\\'s a Tartar!\"\\n\\n\"Pray take some refreshment, sir,\" said I.\\n\\nMr. Guppy sat down at the table and began nervously sharpening the\\ncarving-knife on the carving-fork, still looking at me (as I felt\\nquite sure without looking at him) in the same unusual manner. The\\nsharpening lasted so long that at last I felt a kind of obligation on\\nme to raise my eyes in order that I might break the spell under which\\nhe seemed to labour, of not being able to leave off.\\n\\nHe immediately looked at the dish and began to carve.\\n\\n\"What will you take yourself, miss? You\\'ll take a morsel of\\nsomething?\"\\n\\n\"No, thank you,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Shan\\'t I give you a piece of anything at all, miss?\" said Mr. Guppy,\\nhurriedly drinking off a glass of wine.\\n\\n\"Nothing, thank you,\" said I. \"I have only waited to see that you\\nhave everything you want. Is there anything I can order for you?\"\\n\\n\"No, I am much obliged to you, miss, I\\'m sure. I\\'ve everything that I\\ncan require to make me comfortable--at least I--not comfortable--I\\'m\\nnever that.\" He drank off two more glasses of wine, one after\\nanother.\\n\\nI thought I had better go.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, miss!\" said Mr. Guppy, rising when he saw me\\nrise. \"But would you allow me the favour of a minute\\'s private\\nconversation?\"\\n\\nNot knowing what to say, I sat down again.\\n\\n\"What follows is without prejudice, miss?\" said Mr. Guppy, anxiously\\nbringing a chair towards my table.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand what you mean,\" said I, wondering.\\n\\n\"It\\'s one of our law terms, miss. You won\\'t make any use of it to my\\ndetriment at Kenge and Carboy\\'s or elsewhere. If our conversation\\nshouldn\\'t lead to anything, I am to be as I was and am not to be\\nprejudiced in my situation or worldly prospects. In short, it\\'s in\\ntotal confidence.\"\\n\\n\"I am at a loss, sir,\" said I, \"to imagine what you can have to\\ncommunicate in total confidence to me, whom you have never seen but\\nonce; but I should be very sorry to do you any injury.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, miss. I\\'m sure of it--that\\'s quite sufficient.\" All this\\ntime Mr. Guppy was either planing his forehead with his handkerchief\\nor tightly rubbing the palm of his left hand with the palm of his\\nright. \"If you would excuse my taking another glass of wine, miss, I\\nthink it might assist me in getting on without a continual choke that\\ncannot fail to be mutually unpleasant.\"\\n\\nHe did so, and came back again. I took the opportunity of moving well\\nbehind my table.\\n\\n\"You wouldn\\'t allow me to offer you one, would you miss?\" said Mr.\\nGuppy, apparently refreshed.\\n\\n\"Not any,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Not half a glass?\" said Mr. Guppy. \"Quarter? No! Then, to proceed.\\nMy present salary, Miss Summerson, at Kenge and Carboy\\'s, is two\\npound a week. When I first had the happiness of looking upon you, it\\nwas one fifteen, and had stood at that figure for a lengthened\\nperiod. A rise of five has since taken place, and a further rise of\\nfive is guaranteed at the expiration of a term not exceeding twelve\\nmonths from the present date. My mother has a little property, which\\ntakes the form of a small life annuity, upon which she lives in an\\nindependent though unassuming manner in the Old Street Road. She is\\neminently calculated for a mother-in-law. She never interferes, is\\nall for peace, and her disposition easy. She has her failings--as who\\nhas not?--but I never knew her do it when company was present, at\\nwhich time you may freely trust her with wines, spirits, or malt\\nliquors. My own abode is lodgings at Penton Place, Pentonville. It is\\nlowly, but airy, open at the back, and considered one of the\\n\\'ealthiest outlets. Miss Summerson! In the mildest language, I adore\\nyou. Would you be so kind as to allow me (as I may say) to file a\\ndeclaration--to make an offer!\"\\n\\nMr. Guppy went down on his knees. I was well behind my table and not\\nmuch frightened. I said, \"Get up from that ridiculous position\\nimmediately, sir, or you will oblige me to break my implied promise\\nand ring the bell!\"\\n\\n\"Hear me out, miss!\" said Mr. Guppy, folding his hands.\\n\\n\"I cannot consent to hear another word, sir,\" I returned, \"Unless you\\nget up from the carpet directly and go and sit down at the table as\\nyou ought to do if you have any sense at all.\"\\n\\nHe looked piteously, but slowly rose and did so.\\n\\n\"Yet what a mockery it is, miss,\" he said with his hand upon his\\nheart and shaking his head at me in a melancholy manner over the\\ntray, \"to be stationed behind food at such a moment. The soul recoils\\nfrom food at such a moment, miss.\"\\n\\n\"I beg you to conclude,\" said I; \"you have asked me to hear you out,\\nand I beg you to conclude.\"\\n\\n\"I will, miss,\" said Mr. Guppy. \"As I love and honour, so likewise I\\nobey. Would that I could make thee the subject of that vow before the\\nshrine!\"\\n\\n\"That is quite impossible,\" said I, \"and entirely out of the\\nquestion.\"\\n\\n\"I am aware,\" said Mr. Guppy, leaning forward over the tray and\\nregarding me, as I again strangely felt, though my eyes were not\\ndirected to him, with his late intent look, \"I am aware that in a\\nworldly point of view, according to all appearances, my offer is a\\npoor one. But, Miss Summerson! Angel! No, don\\'t ring--I have been\\nbrought up in a sharp school and am accustomed to a variety of\\ngeneral practice. Though a young man, I have ferreted out evidence,\\ngot up cases, and seen lots of life. Blest with your hand, what means\\nmight I not find of advancing your interests and pushing your\\nfortunes! What might I not get to know, nearly concerning you? I know\\nnothing now, certainly; but what MIGHT I not if I had your\\nconfidence, and you set me on?\"\\n\\nI told him that he addressed my interest or what he supposed to be my\\ninterest quite as unsuccessfully as he addressed my inclination, and\\nhe would now understand that I requested him, if he pleased, to go\\naway immediately.\\n\\n\"Cruel miss,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"hear but another word! I think you\\nmust have seen that I was struck with those charms on the day when I\\nwaited at the Whytorseller. I think you must have remarked that I\\ncould not forbear a tribute to those charms when I put up the steps\\nof the \\'ackney-coach. It was a feeble tribute to thee, but it was\\nwell meant. Thy image has ever since been fixed in my breast. I have\\nwalked up and down of an evening opposite Jellyby\\'s house only to\\nlook upon the bricks that once contained thee. This out of to-day,\\nquite an unnecessary out so far as the attendance, which was its\\npretended object, went, was planned by me alone for thee alone. If I\\nspeak of interest, it is only to recommend myself and my respectful\\nwretchedness. Love was before it, and is before it.\"\\n\\n\"I should be pained, Mr. Guppy,\" said I, rising and putting my hand\\nupon the bell-rope, \"to do you or any one who was sincere the\\ninjustice of slighting any honest feeling, however disagreeably\\nexpressed. If you have really meant to give me a proof of your good\\nopinion, though ill-timed and misplaced, I feel that I ought to thank\\nyou. I have very little reason to be proud, and I am not proud. I\\nhope,\" I think I added, without very well knowing what I said, \"that\\nyou will now go away as if you had never been so exceedingly foolish\\nand attend to Messrs. Kenge and Carboy\\'s business.\"\\n\\n\"Half a minute, miss!\" cried Mr. Guppy, checking me as I was about to\\nring. \"This has been without prejudice?\"\\n\\n\"I will never mention it,\" said I, \"unless you should give me future\\noccasion to do so.\"\\n\\n\"A quarter of a minute, miss! In case you should think better at any\\ntime, however distant--THAT\\'S no consequence, for my feelings can\\nnever alter--of anything I have said, particularly what might I not\\ndo, Mr. William Guppy, eighty-seven, Penton Place, or if removed, or\\ndead (of blighted hopes or anything of that sort), care of Mrs.\\nGuppy, three hundred and two, Old Street Road, will be sufficient.\"\\n\\nI rang the bell, the servant came, and Mr. Guppy, laying his written\\ncard upon the table and making a dejected bow, departed. Raising my\\neyes as he went out, I once more saw him looking at me after he had\\npassed the door.\\n\\nI sat there for another hour or more, finishing my books and payments\\nand getting through plenty of business. Then I arranged my desk, and\\nput everything away, and was so composed and cheerful that I thought\\nI had quite dismissed this unexpected incident. But, when I went\\nupstairs to my own room, I surprised myself by beginning to laugh\\nabout it and then surprised myself still more by beginning to cry\\nabout it. In short, I was in a flutter for a little while and felt as\\nif an old chord had been more coarsely touched than it ever had been\\nsince the days of the dear old doll, long buried in the garden.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the eastern borders of Chancery Lane, that is to say, more\\nparticularly in Cook\\'s Court, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby,\\nlaw-stationer, pursues his lawful calling. In the shade of Cook\\'s\\nCourt, at most times a shady place, Mr. Snagsby has dealt in\\nall sorts of blank forms of legal process; in skins and rolls\\nof parchment; in paper--foolscap, brief, draft, brown, white,\\nwhitey-brown, and blotting; in stamps; in office-quills, pens,\\nink, India-rubber, pounce, pins, pencils, sealing-wax, and\\nwafers; in red tape and green ferret; in pocket-books, almanacs,\\ndiaries, and law lists; in string boxes, rulers, inkstands--glass\\nand leaden--pen-knives, scissors, bodkins, and other small\\noffice-cutlery; in short, in articles too numerous to mention, ever\\nsince he was out of his time and went into partnership with Peffer.\\nOn that occasion, Cook\\'s Court was in a manner revolutionized by the\\nnew inscription in fresh paint, PEFFER AND SNAGSBY, displacing the\\ntime-honoured and not easily to be deciphered legend PEFFER only. For\\nsmoke, which is the London ivy, had so wreathed itself round Peffer\\'s\\nname and clung to his dwelling-place that the affectionate parasite\\nquite overpowered the parent tree.\\n\\nPeffer is never seen in Cook\\'s Court now. He is not expected there,\\nfor he has been recumbent this quarter of a century in the churchyard\\nof St. Andrews, Holborn, with the waggons and hackney-coaches roaring\\npast him all the day and half the night like one great dragon. If he\\never steal forth when the dragon is at rest to air himself again in\\nCook\\'s Court until admonished to return by the crowing of the\\nsanguine cock in the cellar at the little dairy in Cursitor Street,\\nwhose ideas of daylight it would be curious to ascertain, since he\\nknows from his personal observation next to nothing about it--if\\nPeffer ever do revisit the pale glimpses of Cook\\'s Court, which no\\nlaw-stationer in the trade can positively deny, he comes invisibly,\\nand no one is the worse or wiser.\\n\\nIn his lifetime, and likewise in the period of Snagsby\\'s \"time\"\\nof seven long years, there dwelt with Peffer in the same\\nlaw-stationering premises a niece--a short, shrewd niece, something\\ntoo violently compressed about the waist, and with a sharp nose like\\na sharp autumn evening, inclining to be frosty towards the end. The\\nCook\\'s Courtiers had a rumour flying among them that the mother of\\nthis niece did, in her daughter\\'s childhood, moved by too jealous a\\nsolicitude that her figure should approach perfection, lace her\\nup every morning with her maternal foot against the bed-post for\\na stronger hold and purchase; and further, that she exhibited\\ninternally pints of vinegar and lemon-juice, which acids, they held,\\nhad mounted to the nose and temper of the patient. With whichsoever\\nof the many tongues of Rumour this frothy report originated, it\\neither never reached or never influenced the ears of young Snagsby,\\nwho, having wooed and won its fair subject on his arrival at man\\'s\\nestate, entered into two partnerships at once. So now, in Cook\\'s\\nCourt, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby and the niece are one; and the\\nniece still cherishes her figure, which, however tastes may differ,\\nis unquestionably so far precious that there is mighty little of it.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Snagsby are not only one bone and one flesh, but, to the\\nneighbours\\' thinking, one voice too. That voice, appearing to proceed\\nfrom Mrs. Snagsby alone, is heard in Cook\\'s Court very often. Mr.\\nSnagsby, otherwise than as he finds expression through these dulcet\\ntones, is rarely heard. He is a mild, bald, timid man with a shining\\nhead and a scrubby clump of black hair sticking out at the back. He\\ntends to meekness and obesity. As he stands at his door in Cook\\'s\\nCourt in his grey shop-coat and black calico sleeves, looking up at\\nthe clouds, or stands behind a desk in his dark shop with a heavy\\nflat ruler, snipping and slicing at sheepskin in company with his two\\n\\'prentices, he is emphatically a retiring and unassuming man. From\\nbeneath his feet, at such times, as from a shrill ghost unquiet in\\nits grave, there frequently arise complainings and lamentations in\\nthe voice already mentioned; and haply, on some occasions when these\\nreach a sharper pitch than usual, Mr. Snagsby mentions to the\\n\\'prentices, \"I think my little woman is a-giving it to Guster!\"\\n\\nThis proper name, so used by Mr. Snagsby, has before now sharpened\\nthe wit of the Cook\\'s Courtiers to remark that it ought to be the\\nname of Mrs. Snagsby, seeing that she might with great force and\\nexpression be termed a Guster, in compliment to her stormy character.\\nIt is, however, the possession, and the only possession except fifty\\nshillings per annum and a very small box indifferently filled with\\nclothing, of a lean young woman from a workhouse (by some supposed to\\nhave been christened Augusta) who, although she was farmed or\\ncontracted for during her growing time by an amiable benefactor of\\nhis species resident at Tooting, and cannot fail to have been\\ndeveloped under the most favourable circumstances, \"has fits,\" which\\nthe parish can\\'t account for.\\n\\nGuster, really aged three or four and twenty, but looking a round ten\\nyears older, goes cheap with this unaccountable drawback of fits, and\\nis so apprehensive of being returned on the hands of her patron saint\\nthat except when she is found with her head in the pail, or the sink,\\nor the copper, or the dinner, or anything else that happens to be\\nnear her at the time of her seizure, she is always at work. She is a\\nsatisfaction to the parents and guardians of the \\'prentices, who feel\\nthat there is little danger of her inspiring tender emotions in the\\nbreast of youth; she is a satisfaction to Mrs. Snagsby, who can\\nalways find fault with her; she is a satisfaction to Mr. Snagsby, who\\nthinks it a charity to keep her. The law-stationer\\'s establishment\\nis, in Guster\\'s eyes, a temple of plenty and splendour. She believes\\nthe little drawing-room upstairs, always kept, as one may say, with\\nits hair in papers and its pinafore on, to be the most elegant\\napartment in Christendom. The view it commands of Cook\\'s Court at one\\nend (not to mention a squint into Cursitor Street) and of Coavinses\\'\\nthe sheriff\\'s officer\\'s backyard at the other she regards as a\\nprospect of unequalled beauty. The portraits it displays in oil--and\\nplenty of it too--of Mr. Snagsby looking at Mrs. Snagsby and of Mrs.\\nSnagsby looking at Mr. Snagsby are in her eyes as achievements of\\nRaphael or Titian. Guster has some recompenses for her many\\nprivations.\\n\\nMr. Snagsby refers everything not in the practical mysteries of the\\nbusiness to Mrs. Snagsby. She manages the money, reproaches the\\ntax-gatherers, appoints the times and places of devotion on Sundays,\\nlicenses Mr. Snagsby\\'s entertainments, and acknowledges no\\nresponsibility as to what she thinks fit to provide for dinner,\\ninsomuch that she is the high standard of comparison among the\\nneighbouring wives a long way down Chancery Lane on both sides, and\\neven out in Holborn, who in any domestic passages of arms habitually\\ncall upon their husbands to look at the difference between their (the\\nwives\\') position and Mrs. Snagsby\\'s, and their (the husbands\\')\\nbehaviour and Mr. Snagsby\\'s. Rumour, always flying bat-like about\\nCook\\'s Court and skimming in and out at everybody\\'s windows, does say\\nthat Mrs. Snagsby is jealous and inquisitive and that Mr. Snagsby is\\nsometimes worried out of house and home, and that if he had the\\nspirit of a mouse he wouldn\\'t stand it. It is even observed that the\\nwives who quote him to their self-willed husbands as a shining\\nexample in reality look down upon him and that nobody does so with\\ngreater superciliousness than one particular lady whose lord is more\\nthan suspected of laying his umbrella on her as an instrument of\\ncorrection. But these vague whisperings may arise from Mr. Snagsby\\'s\\nbeing in his way rather a meditative and poetical man, loving to walk\\nin Staple Inn in the summer-time and to observe how countrified the\\nsparrows and the leaves are, also to lounge about the Rolls Yard of a\\nSunday afternoon and to remark (if in good spirits) that there were\\nold times once and that you\\'d find a stone coffin or two now under\\nthat chapel, he\\'ll be bound, if you was to dig for it. He solaces his\\nimagination, too, by thinking of the many Chancellors and Vices, and\\nMasters of the Rolls who are deceased; and he gets such a flavour of\\nthe country out of telling the two \\'prentices how he HAS heard say\\nthat a brook \"as clear as crystal\" once ran right down the middle of\\nHolborn, when Turnstile really was a turnstile, leading slap away\\ninto the meadows--gets such a flavour of the country out of this that\\nhe never wants to go there.\\n\\nThe day is closing in and the gas is lighted, but is not yet fully\\neffective, for it is not quite dark. Mr. Snagsby standing at his\\nshop-door looking up at the clouds sees a crow who is out late skim\\nwestward over the slice of sky belonging to Cook\\'s Court. The crow\\nflies straight across Chancery Lane and Lincoln\\'s Inn Garden into\\nLincoln\\'s Inn Fields.\\n\\nHere, in a large house, formerly a house of state, lives Mr.\\nTulkinghorn. It is let off in sets of chambers now, and in those\\nshrunken fragments of its greatness, lawyers lie like maggots in\\nnuts. But its roomy staircases, passages, and antechambers still\\nremain; and even its painted ceilings, where Allegory, in Roman\\nhelmet and celestial linen, sprawls among balustrades and pillars,\\nflowers, clouds, and big-legged boys, and makes the head ache--as\\nwould seem to be Allegory\\'s object always, more or less. Here, among\\nhis many boxes labelled with transcendent names, lives Mr.\\nTulkinghorn, when not speechlessly at home in country-houses where\\nthe great ones of the earth are bored to death. Here he is to-day,\\nquiet at his table. An oyster of the old school whom nobody can open.\\n\\nLike as he is to look at, so is his apartment in the dusk of\\nthe present afternoon. Rusty, out of date, withdrawing from\\nattention, able to afford it. Heavy, broad-backed, old-fashioned,\\nmahogany-and-horsehair chairs, not easily lifted; obsolete tables\\nwith spindle-legs and dusty baize covers; presentation prints of the\\nholders of great titles in the last generation or the last but one,\\nenviron him. A thick and dingy Turkey-carpet muffles the floor where\\nhe sits, attended by two candles in old-fashioned silver candlesticks\\nthat give a very insufficient light to his large room. The titles on\\nthe backs of his books have retired into the binding; everything that\\ncan have a lock has got one; no key is visible. Very few loose papers\\nare about. He has some manuscript near him, but is not referring\\nto it. With the round top of an inkstand and two broken bits of\\nsealing-wax he is silently and slowly working out whatever train of\\nindecision is in his mind. Now the inkstand top is in the middle, now\\nthe red bit of sealing-wax, now the black bit. That\\'s not it. Mr.\\nTulkinghorn must gather them all up and begin again.\\n\\nHere, beneath the painted ceiling, with foreshortened Allegory\\nstaring down at his intrusion as if it meant to swoop upon him, and\\nhe cutting it dead, Mr. Tulkinghorn has at once his house and office.\\nHe keeps no staff, only one middle-aged man, usually a little out at\\nelbows, who sits in a high pew in the hall and is rarely overburdened\\nwith business. Mr. Tulkinghorn is not in a common way. He wants no\\nclerks. He is a great reservoir of confidences, not to be so tapped.\\nHis clients want HIM; he is all in all. Drafts that he requires to be\\ndrawn are drawn by special-pleaders in the temple on mysterious\\ninstructions; fair copies that he requires to be made are made at the\\nstationers\\', expense being no consideration. The middle-aged man in\\nthe pew knows scarcely more of the affairs of the peerage than any\\ncrossing-sweeper in Holborn.\\n\\nThe red bit, the black bit, the inkstand top, the other inkstand top,\\nthe little sand-box. So! You to the middle, you to the right, you to\\nthe left. This train of indecision must surely be worked out now or\\nnever. Now! Mr. Tulkinghorn gets up, adjusts his spectacles, puts on\\nhis hat, puts the manuscript in his pocket, goes out, tells the\\nmiddle-aged man out at elbows, \"I shall be back presently.\" Very\\nrarely tells him anything more explicit.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn goes, as the crow came--not quite so straight, but\\nnearly--to Cook\\'s Court, Cursitor Street. To Snagsby\\'s,\\nLaw-Stationer\\'s, Deeds engrossed and copied, Law-Writing executed in\\nall its branches, &c., &c., &c.\\n\\nIt is somewhere about five or six o\\'clock in the afternoon, and a\\nbalmy fragrance of warm tea hovers in Cook\\'s Court. It hovers about\\nSnagsby\\'s door. The hours are early there: dinner at half-past one\\nand supper at half-past nine. Mr. Snagsby was about to descend into\\nthe subterranean regions to take tea when he looked out of his door\\njust now and saw the crow who was out late.\\n\\n\"Master at home?\"\\n\\nGuster is minding the shop, for the \\'prentices take tea in the\\nkitchen with Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby; consequently, the robe-maker\\'s two\\ndaughters, combing their curls at the two glasses in the two\\nsecond-floor windows of the opposite house, are not driving the two\\n\\'prentices to distraction as they fondly suppose, but are merely\\nawakening the unprofitable admiration of Guster, whose hair won\\'t\\ngrow, and never would, and it is confidently thought, never will.\\n\\n\"Master at home?\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\nMaster is at home, and Guster will fetch him. Guster disappears, glad\\nto get out of the shop, which she regards with mingled dread and\\nveneration as a storehouse of awful implements of the great torture\\nof the law--a place not to be entered after the gas is turned off.\\n\\nMr. Snagsby appears, greasy, warm, herbaceous, and chewing. Bolts a\\nbit of bread and butter. Says, \"Bless my soul, sir! Mr. Tulkinghorn!\"\\n\\n\"I want half a word with you, Snagsby.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, sir! Dear me, sir, why didn\\'t you send your young man\\nround for me? Pray walk into the back shop, sir.\" Snagsby has\\nbrightened in a moment.\\n\\nThe confined room, strong of parchment-grease, is warehouse,\\ncounting-house, and copying-office. Mr. Tulkinghorn sits, facing\\nround, on a stool at the desk.\\n\\n\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Snagsby.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\" Mr. Snagsby turns up the gas and coughs behind his hand,\\nmodestly anticipating profit. Mr. Snagsby, as a timid man, is\\naccustomed to cough with a variety of expressions, and so to save\\nwords.\\n\\n\"You copied some affidavits in that cause for me lately.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, we did.\"\\n\\n\"There was one of them,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, carelessly\\nfeeling--tight, unopenable oyster of the old school!--in the wrong\\ncoat-pocket, \"the handwriting of which is peculiar, and I rather\\nlike. As I happened to be passing, and thought I had it about me, I\\nlooked in to ask you--but I haven\\'t got it. No matter, any other time\\nwill do. Ah! here it is! I looked in to ask you who copied this.\"\\n\\n\"Who copied this, sir?\" says Mr. Snagsby, taking it, laying it flat\\non the desk, and separating all the sheets at once with a twirl and a\\ntwist of the left hand peculiar to lawstationers. \"We gave this out,\\nsir. We were giving out rather a large quantity of work just at that\\ntime. I can tell you in a moment who copied it, sir, by referring to\\nmy book.\"\\n\\nMr. Snagsby takes his book down from the safe, makes another bolt of\\nthe bit of bread and butter which seemed to have stopped short, eyes\\nthe affidavit aside, and brings his right forefinger travelling down\\na page of the book, \"Jewby--Packer--Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Jarndyce! Here we are, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby. \"To be sure! I might\\nhave remembered it. This was given out, sir, to a writer who lodges\\njust over on the opposite side of the lane.\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn has seen the entry, found it before the\\nlaw-stationer, read it while the forefinger was coming down the hill.\\n\\n\"WHAT do you call him? Nemo?\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"Nemo, sir. Here\\nit is. Forty-two folio. Given out on the Wednesday night at eight\\no\\'clock, brought in on the Thursday morning at half after nine.\"\\n\\n\"Nemo!\" repeats Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"Nemo is Latin for no one.\"\\n\\n\"It must be English for some one, sir, I think,\" Mr. Snagsby submits\\nwith his deferential cough. \"It is a person\\'s name. Here it is, you\\nsee, sir! Forty-two folio. Given out Wednesday night, eight o\\'clock;\\nbrought in Thursday morning, half after nine.\"\\n\\nThe tail of Mr. Snagsby\\'s eye becomes conscious of the head of Mrs.\\nSnagsby looking in at the shop-door to know what he means by\\ndeserting his tea. Mr. Snagsby addresses an explanatory cough to Mrs.\\nSnagsby, as who should say, \"My dear, a customer!\"\\n\\n\"Half after nine, sir,\" repeats Mr. Snagsby. \"Our law-writers, who\\nlive by job-work, are a queer lot; and this may not be his name, but\\nit\\'s the name he goes by. I remember now, sir, that he gives it in a\\nwritten advertisement he sticks up down at the Rule Office, and the\\nKing\\'s Bench Office, and the Judges\\' Chambers, and so forth. You know\\nthe kind of document, sir--wanting employ?\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn glances through the little window at the back of\\nCoavinses\\', the sheriff\\'s officer\\'s, where lights shine in Coavinses\\'\\nwindows. Coavinses\\' coffee-room is at the back, and the shadows of\\nseveral gentlemen under a cloud loom cloudily upon the blinds. Mr.\\nSnagsby takes the opportunity of slightly turning his head to glance\\nover his shoulder at his little woman and to make apologetic motions\\nwith his mouth to this effect: \"Tul-king-horn--rich--in-flu-en-tial!\"\\n\\n\"Have you given this man work before?\" asks Mr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, yes, sir! Work of yours.\"\\n\\n\"Thinking of more important matters, I forget where you said he\\nlived?\"\\n\\n\"Across the lane, sir. In fact, he lodges at a--\" Mr. Snagsby makes\\nanother bolt, as if the bit of bread and butter were insurmountable\\n\"--at a rag and bottle shop.\"\\n\\n\"Can you show me the place as I go back?\"\\n\\n\"With the greatest pleasure, sir!\"\\n\\nMr. Snagsby pulls off his sleeves and his grey coat, pulls on his\\nblack coat, takes his hat from its peg. \"Oh! Here is my little\\nwoman!\" he says aloud. \"My dear, will you be so kind as to tell one\\nof the lads to look after the shop while I step across the lane with\\nMr. Tulkinghorn? Mrs. Snagsby, sir--I shan\\'t be two minutes, my\\nlove!\"\\n\\nMrs. Snagsby bends to the lawyer, retires behind the counter, peeps\\nat them through the window-blind, goes softly into the back office,\\nrefers to the entries in the book still lying open. Is evidently\\ncurious.\\n\\n\"You will find that the place is rough, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby,\\nwalking deferentially in the road and leaving the narrow pavement to\\nthe lawyer; \"and the party is very rough. But they\\'re a wild lot in\\ngeneral, sir. The advantage of this particular man is that he never\\nwants sleep. He\\'ll go at it right on end if you want him to, as long\\nas ever you like.\"\\n\\nIt is quite dark now, and the gas-lamps have acquired their full\\neffect. Jostling against clerks going to post the day\\'s letters, and\\nagainst counsel and attorneys going home to dinner, and against\\nplaintiffs and defendants and suitors of all sorts, and against the\\ngeneral crowd, in whose way the forensic wisdom of ages has\\ninterposed a million of obstacles to the transaction of the commonest\\nbusiness of life; diving through law and equity, and through that\\nkindred mystery, the street mud, which is made of nobody knows what\\nand collects about us nobody knows whence or how--we only knowing in\\ngeneral that when there is too much of it we find it necessary to\\nshovel it away--the lawyer and the law-stationer come to a rag and\\nbottle shop and general emporium of much disregarded merchandise,\\nlying and being in the shadow of the wall of Lincoln\\'s Inn, and kept,\\nas is announced in paint, to all whom it may concern, by one Krook.\\n\\n\"This is where he lives, sir,\" says the law-stationer.\\n\\n\"This is where he lives, is it?\" says the lawyer unconcernedly.\\n\"Thank you.\"\\n\\n\"Are you not going in, sir?\"\\n\\n\"No, thank you, no; I am going on to the Fields at present. Good\\nevening. Thank you!\" Mr. Snagsby lifts his hat and returns to his\\nlittle woman and his tea.\\n\\nBut Mr. Tulkinghorn does not go on to the Fields at present. He goes\\na short way, turns back, comes again to the shop of Mr. Krook, and\\nenters it straight. It is dim enough, with a blot-headed candle or so\\nin the windows, and an old man and a cat sitting in the back part by\\na fire. The old man rises and comes forward, with another blot-headed\\ncandle in his hand.\\n\\n\"Pray is your lodger within?\"\\n\\n\"Male or female, sir?\" says Mr. Krook.\\n\\n\"Male. The person who does copying.\"\\n\\nMr. Krook has eyed his man narrowly. Knows him by sight. Has an\\nindistinct impression of his aristocratic repute.\\n\\n\"Did you wish to see him, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s what I seldom do myself,\" says Mr. Krook with a grin. \"Shall I\\ncall him down? But it\\'s a weak chance if he\\'d come, sir!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go up to him, then,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"Second floor, sir. Take the candle. Up there!\" Mr. Krook, with his\\ncat beside him, stands at the bottom of the staircase, looking after\\nMr. Tulkinghorn. \"Hi-hi!\" he says when Mr. Tulkinghorn has nearly\\ndisappeared. The lawyer looks down over the hand-rail. The cat\\nexpands her wicked mouth and snarls at him.\\n\\n\"Order, Lady Jane! Behave yourself to visitors, my lady! You know\\nwhat they say of my lodger?\" whispers Krook, going up a step or two.\\n\\n\"What do they say of him?\"\\n\\n\"They say he has sold himself to the enemy, but you and I know\\nbetter--he don\\'t buy. I\\'ll tell you what, though; my lodger is so\\nblack-humoured and gloomy that I believe he\\'d as soon make that\\nbargain as any other. Don\\'t put him out, sir. That\\'s my advice!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn with a nod goes on his way. He comes to the dark door\\non the second floor. He knocks, receives no answer, opens it, and\\naccidentally extinguishes his candle in doing so.\\n\\nThe air of the room is almost bad enough to have extinguished it if\\nhe had not. It is a small room, nearly black with soot, and grease,\\nand dirt. In the rusty skeleton of a grate, pinched at the middle as\\nif poverty had gripped it, a red coke fire burns low. In the corner\\nby the chimney stand a deal table and a broken desk, a wilderness\\nmarked with a rain of ink. In another corner a ragged old portmanteau\\non one of the two chairs serves for cabinet or wardrobe; no larger\\none is needed, for it collapses like the cheeks of a starved man. The\\nfloor is bare, except that one old mat, trodden to shreds of\\nrope-yarn, lies perishing upon the hearth. No curtain veils the\\ndarkness of the night, but the discoloured shutters are drawn\\ntogether, and through the two gaunt holes pierced in them, famine\\nmight be staring in--the banshee of the man upon the bed.\\n\\nFor, on a low bed opposite the fire, a confusion of dirty patchwork,\\nlean-ribbed ticking, and coarse sacking, the lawyer, hesitating just\\nwithin the doorway, sees a man. He lies there, dressed in shirt and\\ntrousers, with bare feet. He has a yellow look in the spectral\\ndarkness of a candle that has guttered down until the whole length of\\nits wick (still burning) has doubled over and left a tower of\\nwinding-sheet above it. His hair is ragged, mingling with his\\nwhiskers and his beard--the latter, ragged too, and grown, like the\\nscum and mist around him, in neglect. Foul and filthy as the room is,\\nfoul and filthy as the air is, it is not easy to perceive what fumes\\nthose are which most oppress the senses in it; but through the\\ngeneral sickliness and faintness, and the odour of stale tobacco,\\nthere comes into the lawyer\\'s mouth the bitter, vapid taste of opium.\\n\\n\"Hallo, my friend!\" he cries, and strikes his iron candlestick\\nagainst the door.\\n\\nHe thinks he has awakened his friend. He lies a little turned away,\\nbut his eyes are surely open.\\n\\n\"Hallo, my friend!\" he cries again. \"Hallo! Hallo!\"\\n\\nAs he rattles on the door, the candle which has drooped so long goes\\nout and leaves him in the dark, with the gaunt eyes in the shutters\\nstaring down upon the bed.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'model_output': \" The text describes the lives and interactions of various characters in London in the mid-19th century.

The High Court of Chancery is in session, and it appears that the fog has settled thickest on this part of London. This is where the legal suit of Jarndyce and Jarndyce is being argued. A little mad old woman (Miss Flite), and a man from Shropshire (Mr. Gridley) are in attendance. A \"sallow prisoner\" is brought forward. Mr. Tangle, a lawyer, speaks with the Lord High Chancellor, and the matter of the two young wards in Jarndyce is discussed. This matter will come up before the court tomorrow.\\n\\nThe scene changes in Chapter 2 to Chesney Wold, a stately home in Lincolnshire. Here the weather is also bad, but it is constant rain rather than fog. The lady of the manor, Lady Dedlock, is bored to death. She had been in London, and has come back to the country seat before leaving for Paris in a few days.\\n\\nLady Dedlock is introduced to us as a very beautiful middle-aged society lady, her charms undimmed by time. She is exceedingly dignified and self-controlled, but her \"caprices,\" which she tries to hide, are known to her servants and tradesmen. She is the wife of Sir Leicester Dedlock, a baronet, who has married somehat beneath him. It is clear that Lady Dedlock has brought neither an aristocratic lineage or a fortune to the marriage. It is also clear that Sir Leicester has such a great amount of both of those things, and loves her so dearly, that it matters not to him.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn, the family solicitor, has come down to Chesney Wold to discuss the Jarndyce case, in which Lady Dedlock has some slight interest. He is a secretive, enigmatic man, of the most controlled and logical character. He brings many legal papers with him, and Lady Dedlock seems to take an interest in the handwriting on one of them. She asks whose writing it is, but Mr. Tulkinghorn cannot answer her. She becomes faint and must be taken to her room.\\n\\nIn Chapter 3, Esther Summerson\\'s life story is told. She has been materially provided for but emotionally neglected by her \"godmother\" in the town of Windsor. When Esther is about fourteen, her godmother dies, and Esther is sent to Greenleaf school. Through Mr. Kenge, John Jarndyce\\'s solicitor, who comes to see Esther after her godmother\\'s death, she learns her benefactor is Mr. Jarndyce. She has never seen him, but he appears, unbeknownst to her until years later, in the carriage that takes her to Greenleaf school. She is sent there after her godmother\\'s death, and passes six happy years there, being taught by the Misses Donny. Her accounts are paid by her unknown benefactor all the while. When she is older she becomes a teacher of the other girls there, and inspires great affection in her students.\\n\\nWhen she has grown old and educated enough to leave Greenleaf school, she is asked to serve in her benefactor\\'s house, Bleak House. She is brought to Chancery Court to meet Ada Clare and Richard Carstone, two wards in the Jarndyce suit, who are also under the guardianship of Mr. Jarndyce. Esther is meant to be Ada\\'s lady companion.\\n\\nAs they leave the court, they meet Miss Flite, who introduces herself. They learn she is also a suitor in Chancery, and observe that she is poor, eccentric, and perhaps a little mad.\\n\\nIn Chapter 4, the three young people are sent to stay the night at the Jellyby household. Mrs. Jellyby is a philanthropic lady who neglects her large and chaotic household in favor of writing long letters, dictated to her eldest daughter Caddy, about the social conditions in places in Africa. Caddy, an overworked waif, clings to Esther and becomes her friend, as does the youngest neglected child, Peepy. ', 'text': 'London.

Dogs, undistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better;\\nsplashed to their very blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one\\nanother\\'s umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper, and losing\\ntheir foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of thousands of other\\nfoot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke\\n(if this day ever broke), adding new deposits to the crust upon crust\\nof mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and\\naccumulating at compound interest.\\n\\nFog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and\\nmeadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers\\nof shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city.\\nFog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping\\ninto the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards and\\nhovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales\\nof barges and small boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient\\nGreenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog\\nin the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper,\\ndown in his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of\\nhis shivering little \\'prentice boy on deck. Chance people on the\\nbridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog\\nall round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the\\nmisty clouds.\\n\\nGas looming through the fog in divers places in the streets, much as\\nthe sun may, from the spongey fields, be seen to loom by husbandman\\nand ploughboy. Most of the shops lighted two hours before their\\ntime--as the gas seems to know, for it has a haggard and unwilling\\nlook.\\n\\nThe raw afternoon is rawest, and the dense fog is densest, and the\\nmuddy streets are muddiest near that leaden-headed old obstruction,\\nappropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed old\\ncorporation, Temple Bar. And hard by Temple Bar, in Lincoln\\'s Inn\\nHall, at the very heart of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor in\\nhis High Court of Chancery.\\n\\nNever can there come fog too thick, never can there come mud and mire\\ntoo deep, to assort with the groping and floundering condition which\\nthis High Court of Chancery, most pestilent of hoary sinners, holds\\nthis day in the sight of heaven and earth.\\n\\nOn such an afternoon, if ever, the Lord High Chancellor ought to be\\nsitting here--as here he is--with a foggy glory round his head,\\nsoftly fenced in with crimson cloth and curtains, addressed by a\\nlarge advocate with great whiskers, a little voice, and an\\ninterminable brief, and outwardly directing his contemplation to the\\nlantern in the roof, where he can see nothing but fog. On such an\\nafternoon some score of members of the High Court of Chancery bar\\nought to be--as here they are--mistily engaged in one of the ten\\nthousand stages of an endless cause, tripping one another up on\\nslippery precedents, groping knee-deep in technicalities, running\\ntheir goat-hair and horsehair warded heads against walls of words and\\nmaking a pretence of equity with serious faces, as players might. On\\nsuch an afternoon the various solicitors in the cause, some two or\\nthree of whom have inherited it from their fathers, who made a\\nfortune by it, ought to be--as are they not?--ranged in a line, in a\\nlong matted well (but you might look in vain for truth at the bottom\\nof it) between the registrar\\'s red table and the silk gowns, with\\nbills, cross-bills, answers, rejoinders, injunctions, affidavits,\\nissues, references to masters, masters\\' reports, mountains of costly\\nnonsense, piled before them. Well may the court be dim, with wasting\\ncandles here and there; well may the fog hang heavy in it, as if it\\nwould never get out; well may the stained-glass windows lose their\\ncolour and admit no light of day into the place; well may the\\nuninitiated from the streets, who peep in through the glass panes in\\nthe door, be deterred from entrance by its owlish aspect and by the\\ndrawl, languidly echoing to the roof from the padded dais where the\\nLord High Chancellor looks into the lantern that has no light in it\\nand where the attendant wigs are all stuck in a fog-bank! This is the\\nCourt of Chancery, which has its decaying houses and its blighted\\nlands in every shire, which has its worn-out lunatic in every\\nmadhouse and its dead in every churchyard, which has its ruined\\nsuitor with his slipshod heels and threadbare dress borrowing and\\nbegging through the round of every man\\'s acquaintance, which gives to\\nmonied might the means abundantly of wearying out the right, which so\\nexhausts finances, patience, courage, hope, so overthrows the brain\\nand breaks the heart, that there is not an honourable man among its\\npractitioners who would not give--who does not often give--the\\nwarning, \"Suffer any wrong that can be done you rather than come\\nhere!\"\\n\\nWho happen to be in the Lord Chancellor\\'s court this murky afternoon\\nbesides the Lord Chancellor, the counsel in the cause, two or three\\ncounsel who are never in any cause, and the well of solicitors before\\nmentioned? There is the registrar below the judge, in wig and gown;\\nand there are two or three maces, or petty-bags, or privy purses, or\\nwhatever they may be, in legal court suits. These are all yawning,\\nfor no crumb of amusement ever falls from Jarndyce and Jarndyce (the\\ncause in hand), which was squeezed dry years upon years ago. The\\nshort-hand writers, the reporters of the court, and the reporters of\\nthe newspapers invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce comes on. Their places are a blank. Standing on\\na seat at the side of the hall, the better to peer into the curtained\\nsanctuary, is a little mad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is\\nalways in court, from its sitting to its rising, and always expecting\\nsome incomprehensible judgment to be given in her favour. Some say\\nshe really is, or was, a party to a suit, but no one knows for\\ncertain because no one cares. She carries some small litter in a\\nreticule which she calls her documents, principally consisting of\\npaper matches and dry lavender. A sallow prisoner has come up, in\\ncustody, for the half-dozenth time to make a personal application \"to\\npurge himself of his contempt,\" which, being a solitary surviving\\nexecutor who has fallen into a state of conglomeration about accounts\\nof which it is not pretended that he had ever any knowledge, he is\\nnot at all likely ever to do. In the meantime his prospects in life\\nare ended. Another ruined suitor, who periodically appears from\\nShropshire and breaks out into efforts to address the Chancellor at\\nthe close of the day\\'s business and who can by no means be made to\\nunderstand that the Chancellor is legally ignorant of his existence\\nafter making it desolate for a quarter of a century, plants himself\\nin a good place and keeps an eye on the judge, ready to call out \"My\\nLord!\" in a voice of sonorous complaint on the instant of his rising.\\nA few lawyers\\' clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger\\non the chance of his furnishing some fun and enlivening the dismal\\nweather a little.\\n\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in\\ncourse of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it\\nmeans. The parties to it understand it least, but it has been\\nobserved that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five\\nminutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the\\npremises. Innumerable children have been born into the cause;\\ninnumerable young people have married into it; innumerable old people\\nhave died out of it. Scores of persons have deliriously found\\nthemselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without knowing how\\nor why; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the\\nsuit. The little plaintiff or defendant who was promised a new\\nrocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled has grown\\nup, possessed himself of a real horse, and trotted away into the\\nother world. Fair wards of court have faded into mothers and\\ngrandmothers; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone\\nout; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere\\nbills of mortality; there are not three Jarndyces left upon the earth\\nperhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a\\ncoffee-house in Chancery Lane; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags\\nits dreary length before the court, perennially hopeless.\\n\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce has passed into a joke. That is the only good\\nthat has ever come of it. It has been death to many, but it is a joke\\nin the profession. Every master in Chancery has had a reference out\\nof it. Every Chancellor was \"in it,\" for somebody or other, when he\\nwas counsel at the bar. Good things have been said about it by\\nblue-nosed, bulbous-shoed old benchers in select port-wine committee\\nafter dinner in hall. Articled clerks have been in the habit of\\nfleshing their legal wit upon it. The last Lord Chancellor handled it\\nneatly, when, correcting Mr. Blowers, the eminent silk gown who said\\nthat such a thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes, he\\nobserved, \"or when we get through Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mr.\\nBlowers\"--a pleasantry that particularly tickled the maces, bags, and\\npurses.\\n\\nHow many people out of the suit Jarndyce and Jarndyce has stretched\\nforth its unwholesome hand to spoil and corrupt would be a very wide\\nquestion. From the master upon whose impaling files reams of dusty\\nwarrants in Jarndyce and Jarndyce have grimly writhed into many\\nshapes, down to the copying-clerk in the Six Clerks\\' Office who has\\ncopied his tens of thousands of Chancery folio-pages under that\\neternal heading, no man\\'s nature has been made better by it. In\\ntrickery, evasion, procrastination, spoliation, botheration, under\\nfalse pretences of all sorts, there are influences that can never\\ncome to good. The very solicitors\\' boys who have kept the wretched\\nsuitors at bay, by protesting time out of mind that Mr. Chizzle,\\nMizzle, or otherwise was particularly engaged and had appointments\\nuntil dinner, may have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into\\nthemselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The receiver in the cause\\nhas acquired a goodly sum of money by it but has acquired too a\\ndistrust of his own mother and a contempt for his own kind. Chizzle,\\nMizzle, and otherwise have lapsed into a habit of vaguely promising\\nthemselves that they will look into that outstanding little matter\\nand see what can be done for Drizzle--who was not well used--when\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of the office. Shirking and\\nsharking in all their many varieties have been sown broadcast by the\\nill-fated cause; and even those who have contemplated its history\\nfrom the outermost circle of such evil have been insensibly tempted\\ninto a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad\\ncourse, and a loose belief that if the world go wrong it was in some\\noff-hand manner never meant to go right.\\n\\nThus, in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog, sits the\\nLord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery.\\n\\n\"Mr. Tangle,\" says the Lord High Chancellor, latterly something\\nrestless under the eloquence of that learned gentleman.\\n\\n\"Mlud,\" says Mr. Tangle. Mr. Tangle knows more of Jarndyce and\\nJarndyce than anybody. He is famous for it--supposed never to have\\nread anything else since he left school.\\n\\n\"Have you nearly concluded your argument?\"\\n\\n\"Mlud, no--variety of points--feel it my duty tsubmit--ludship,\" is\\nthe reply that slides out of Mr. Tangle.\\n\\n\"Several members of the bar are still to be heard, I believe?\" says\\nthe Chancellor with a slight smile.\\n\\nEighteen of Mr. Tangle\\'s learned friends, each armed with a little\\nsummary of eighteen hundred sheets, bob up like eighteen hammers in a\\npianoforte, make eighteen bows, and drop into their eighteen places\\nof obscurity.\\n\\n\"We will proceed with the hearing on Wednesday fortnight,\" says the\\nChancellor. For the question at issue is only a question of costs, a\\nmere bud on the forest tree of the parent suit, and really will come\\nto a settlement one of these days.\\n\\nThe Chancellor rises; the bar rises; the prisoner is brought forward\\nin a hurry; the man from Shropshire cries, \"My lord!\" Maces, bags,\\nand purses indignantly proclaim silence and frown at the man from\\nShropshire.\\n\\n\"In reference,\" proceeds the Chancellor, still on Jarndyce and\\nJarndyce, \"to the young girl--\"\\n\\n\"Begludship\\'s pardon--boy,\" says Mr. Tangle prematurely. \"In\\nreference,\" proceeds the Chancellor with extra distinctness, \"to the\\nyoung girl and boy, the two young people\"--Mr. Tangle crushed--\"whom\\nI directed to be in attendance to-day and who are now in my private\\nroom, I will see them and satisfy myself as to the expediency of\\nmaking the order for their residing with their uncle.\"\\n\\nMr. Tangle on his legs again. \"Begludship\\'s pardon--dead.\"\\n\\n\"With their\"--Chancellor looking through his double eye-glass at the\\npapers on his desk--\"grandfather.\"\\n\\n\"Begludship\\'s pardon--victim of rash action--brains.\"\\n\\nSuddenly a very little counsel with a terrific bass voice arises,\\nfully inflated, in the back settlements of the fog, and says, \"Will\\nyour lordship allow me? I appear for him. He is a cousin, several\\ntimes removed. I am not at the moment prepared to inform the court in\\nwhat exact remove he is a cousin, but he IS a cousin.\"\\n\\nLeaving this address (delivered like a sepulchral message) ringing in\\nthe rafters of the roof, the very little counsel drops, and the fog\\nknows him no more. Everybody looks for him. Nobody can see him.\\n\\n\"I will speak with both the young people,\" says the Chancellor anew,\\n\"and satisfy myself on the subject of their residing with their\\ncousin. I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I take my\\nseat.\"\\n\\nThe Chancellor is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is\\npresented. Nothing can possibly come of the prisoner\\'s conglomeration\\nbut his being sent back to prison, which is soon done. The man from\\nShropshire ventures another remonstrative \"My lord!\" but the\\nChancellor, being aware of him, has dexterously vanished. Everybody\\nelse quickly vanishes too. A battery of blue bags is loaded with\\nheavy charges of papers and carried off by clerks; the little mad old\\nwoman marches off with her documents; the empty court is locked up.\\nIf all the injustice it has committed and all the misery it has\\ncaused could only be locked up with it, and the whole burnt away in a\\ngreat funeral pyre--why so much the better for other parties than the\\nparties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce!\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this same\\nmiry afternoon. It is not so unlike the Court of Chancery but that we\\nmay pass from the one scene to the other, as the crow flies. Both the\\nworld of fashion and the Court of Chancery are things of precedent\\nand usage: oversleeping Rip Van Winkles who have played at strange\\ngames through a deal of thundery weather; sleeping beauties whom the\\nknight will wake one day, when all the stopped spits in the kitchen\\nshall begin to turn prodigiously!\\n\\nIt is not a large world. Relatively even to this world of ours, which\\nhas its limits too (as your Highness shall find when you have made\\nthe tour of it and are come to the brink of the void beyond), it is a\\nvery little speck. There is much good in it; there are many good and\\ntrue people in it; it has its appointed place. But the evil of it is\\nthat it is a world wrapped up in too much jeweller\\'s cotton and fine\\nwool, and cannot hear the rushing of the larger worlds, and cannot\\nsee them as they circle round the sun. It is a deadened world, and\\nits growth is sometimes unhealthy for want of air.\\n\\nMy Lady Dedlock has returned to her house in town for a few days\\nprevious to her departure for Paris, where her ladyship intends to\\nstay some weeks, after which her movements are uncertain. The\\nfashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the Parisians,\\nand it knows all fashionable things. To know things otherwise were to\\nbe unfashionable. My Lady Dedlock has been down at what she calls, in\\nfamiliar conversation, her \"place\" in Lincolnshire. The waters are\\nout in Lincolnshire. An arch of the bridge in the park has been\\nsapped and sopped away. The adjacent low-lying ground for half a mile\\nin breadth is a stagnant river with melancholy trees for islands in\\nit and a surface punctured all over, all day long, with falling rain.\\nMy Lady Dedlock\\'s place has been extremely dreary. The weather for\\nmany a day and night has been so wet that the trees seem wet through,\\nand the soft loppings and prunings of the woodman\\'s axe can make no\\ncrash or crackle as they fall. The deer, looking soaked, leave\\nquagmires where they pass. The shot of a rifle loses its sharpness in\\nthe moist air, and its smoke moves in a tardy little cloud towards\\nthe green rise, coppice-topped, that makes a background for the\\nfalling rain. The view from my Lady Dedlock\\'s own windows is\\nalternately a lead-coloured view and a view in Indian ink. The vases\\non the stone terrace in the foreground catch the rain all day; and\\nthe heavy drops fall--drip, drip, drip--upon the broad flagged\\npavement, called from old time the Ghost\\'s Walk, all night. On\\nSundays the little church in the park is mouldy; the oaken pulpit\\nbreaks out into a cold sweat; and there is a general smell and taste\\nas of the ancient Dedlocks in their graves. My Lady Dedlock (who is\\nchildless), looking out in the early twilight from her boudoir at a\\nkeeper\\'s lodge and seeing the light of a fire upon the latticed\\npanes, and smoke rising from the chimney, and a child, chased by a\\nwoman, running out into the rain to meet the shining figure of a\\nwrapped-up man coming through the gate, has been put quite out of\\ntemper. My Lady Dedlock says she has been \"bored to death.\"\\n\\nTherefore my Lady Dedlock has come away from the place in\\nLincolnshire and has left it to the rain, and the crows, and the\\nrabbits, and the deer, and the partridges and pheasants. The pictures\\nof the Dedlocks past and gone have seemed to vanish into the damp\\nwalls in mere lowness of spirits, as the housekeeper has passed along\\nthe old rooms shutting up the shutters. And when they will next come\\nforth again, the fashionable intelligence--which, like the fiend, is\\nomniscient of the past and present, but not the future--cannot yet\\nundertake to say.\\n\\nSir Leicester Dedlock is only a baronet, but there is no mightier\\nbaronet than he. His family is as old as the hills, and infinitely\\nmore respectable. He has a general opinion that the world might get\\non without hills but would be done up without Dedlocks. He would on\\nthe whole admit nature to be a good idea (a little low, perhaps, when\\nnot enclosed with a park-fence), but an idea dependent for its\\nexecution on your great county families. He is a gentleman of strict\\nconscience, disdainful of all littleness and meanness and ready on\\nthe shortest notice to die any death you may please to mention rather\\nthan give occasion for the least impeachment of his integrity. He is\\nan honourable, obstinate, truthful, high-spirited, intensely\\nprejudiced, perfectly unreasonable man.\\n\\nSir Leicester is twenty years, full measure, older than my Lady. He\\nwill never see sixty-five again, nor perhaps sixty-six, nor yet\\nsixty-seven. He has a twist of the gout now and then and walks a\\nlittle stiffly. He is of a worthy presence, with his light-grey hair\\nand whiskers, his fine shirt-frill, his pure-white waistcoat, and his\\nblue coat with bright buttons always buttoned. He is ceremonious,\\nstately, most polite on every occasion to my Lady, and holds her\\npersonal attractions in the highest estimation. His gallantry to my\\nLady, which has never changed since he courted her, is the one little\\ntouch of romantic fancy in him.\\n\\nIndeed, he married her for love. A whisper still goes about that she\\nhad not even family; howbeit, Sir Leicester had so much family that\\nperhaps he had enough and could dispense with any more. But she had\\nbeauty, pride, ambition, insolent resolve, and sense enough to\\nportion out a legion of fine ladies. Wealth and station, added to\\nthese, soon floated her upward, and for years now my Lady Dedlock has\\nbeen at the centre of the fashionable intelligence and at the top of\\nthe fashionable tree.\\n\\nHow Alexander wept when he had no more worlds to conquer, everybody\\nknows--or has some reason to know by this time, the matter having\\nbeen rather frequently mentioned. My Lady Dedlock, having conquered\\nHER world, fell not into the melting, but rather into the freezing,\\nmood. An exhausted composure, a worn-out placidity, an equanimity of\\nfatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction, are the\\ntrophies of her victory. She is perfectly well-bred. If she could be\\ntranslated to heaven to-morrow, she might be expected to ascend\\nwithout any rapture.\\n\\nShe has beauty still, and if it be not in its heyday, it is not yet\\nin its autumn. She has a fine face--originally of a character that\\nwould be rather called very pretty than handsome, but improved into\\nclassicality by the acquired expression of her fashionable state. Her\\nfigure is elegant and has the effect of being tall. Not that she is\\nso, but that \"the most is made,\" as the Honourable Bob Stables has\\nfrequently asserted upon oath, \"of all her points.\" The same\\nauthority observes that she is perfectly got up and remarks in\\ncommendation of her hair especially that she is the best-groomed\\nwoman in the whole stud.\\n\\nWith all her perfections on her head, my Lady Dedlock has come up\\nfrom her place in Lincolnshire (hotly pursued by the fashionable\\nintelligence) to pass a few days at her house in town previous to her\\ndeparture for Paris, where her ladyship intends to stay some weeks,\\nafter which her movements are uncertain. And at her house in town,\\nupon this muddy, murky afternoon, presents himself an old-fashioned\\nold gentleman, attorney-at-law and eke solicitor of the High Court of\\nChancery, who has the honour of acting as legal adviser of the\\nDedlocks and has as many cast-iron boxes in his office with that name\\noutside as if the present baronet were the coin of the conjuror\\'s\\ntrick and were constantly being juggled through the whole set. Across\\nthe hall, and up the stairs, and along the passages, and through the\\nrooms, which are very brilliant in the season and very dismal out of\\nit--fairy-land to visit, but a desert to live in--the old gentleman\\nis conducted by a Mercury in powder to my Lady\\'s presence.\\n\\nThe old gentleman is rusty to look at, but is reputed to have made\\ngood thrift out of aristocratic marriage settlements and aristocratic\\nwills, and to be very rich. He is surrounded by a mysterious halo of\\nfamily confidences, of which he is known to be the silent depository.\\nThere are noble mausoleums rooted for centuries in retired glades of\\nparks among the growing timber and the fern, which perhaps hold fewer\\nnoble secrets than walk abroad among men, shut up in the breast of\\nMr. Tulkinghorn. He is of what is called the old school--a phrase\\ngenerally meaning any school that seems never to have been young--and\\nwears knee-breeches tied with ribbons, and gaiters or stockings. One\\npeculiarity of his black clothes and of his black stockings, be they\\nsilk or worsted, is that they never shine. Mute, close, irresponsive\\nto any glancing light, his dress is like himself. He never converses\\nwhen not professionally consulted. He is found sometimes, speechless\\nbut quite at home, at corners of dinner-tables in great country\\nhouses and near doors of drawing-rooms, concerning which the\\nfashionable intelligence is eloquent, where everybody knows him and\\nwhere half the Peerage stops to say \"How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?\"\\nHe receives these salutations with gravity and buries them along with\\nthe rest of his knowledge.\\n\\nSir Leicester Dedlock is with my Lady and is happy to see Mr.\\nTulkinghorn. There is an air of prescription about him which is\\nalways agreeable to Sir Leicester; he receives it as a kind of\\ntribute. He likes Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s dress; there is a kind of tribute\\nin that too. It is eminently respectable, and likewise, in a general\\nway, retainer-like. It expresses, as it were, the steward of the\\nlegal mysteries, the butler of the legal cellar, of the Dedlocks.\\n\\nHas Mr. Tulkinghorn any idea of this himself? It may be so, or it may\\nnot, but there is this remarkable circumstance to be noted in\\neverything associated with my Lady Dedlock as one of a class--as one\\nof the leaders and representatives of her little world. She supposes\\nherself to be an inscrutable Being, quite out of the reach and ken of\\nordinary mortals--seeing herself in her glass, where indeed she looks\\nso. Yet every dim little star revolving about her, from her maid to\\nthe manager of the Italian Opera, knows her weaknesses, prejudices,\\nfollies, haughtinesses, and caprices and lives upon as accurate a\\ncalculation and as nice a measure of her moral nature as her\\ndressmaker takes of her physical proportions. Is a new dress, a new\\ncustom, a new singer, a new dancer, a new form of jewellery, a new\\ndwarf or giant, a new chapel, a new anything, to be set up? There are\\ndeferential people in a dozen callings whom my Lady Dedlock suspects\\nof nothing but prostration before her, who can tell you how to manage\\nher as if she were a baby, who do nothing but nurse her all their\\nlives, who, humbly affecting to follow with profound subservience,\\nlead her and her whole troop after them; who, in hooking one, hook\\nall and bear them off as Lemuel Gulliver bore away the stately fleet\\nof the majestic Lilliput. \"If you want to address our people, sir,\"\\nsay Blaze and Sparkle, the jewellers--meaning by our people Lady\\nDedlock and the rest--\"you must remember that you are not dealing\\nwith the general public; you must hit our people in their weakest\\nplace, and their weakest place is such a place.\" \"To make this\\narticle go down, gentlemen,\" say Sheen and Gloss, the mercers, to\\ntheir friends the manufacturers, \"you must come to us, because we\\nknow where to have the fashionable people, and we can make it\\nfashionable.\" \"If you want to get this print upon the tables of my\\nhigh connexion, sir,\" says Mr. Sladdery, the librarian, \"or if you\\nwant to get this dwarf or giant into the houses of my high connexion,\\nsir, or if you want to secure to this entertainment the patronage of\\nmy high connexion, sir, you must leave it, if you please, to me, for\\nI have been accustomed to study the leaders of my high connexion,\\nsir, and I may tell you without vanity that I can turn them round my\\nfinger\"--in which Mr. Sladdery, who is an honest man, does not\\nexaggerate at all.\\n\\nTherefore, while Mr. Tulkinghorn may not know what is passing in the\\nDedlock mind at present, it is very possible that he may.\\n\\n\"My Lady\\'s cause has been again before the Chancellor, has it, Mr.\\nTulkinghorn?\" says Sir Leicester, giving him his hand.\\n\\n\"Yes. It has been on again to-day,\" Mr. Tulkinghorn replies, making\\none of his quiet bows to my Lady, who is on a sofa near the fire,\\nshading her face with a hand-screen.\\n\\n\"It would be useless to ask,\" says my Lady with the dreariness of the\\nplace in Lincolnshire still upon her, \"whether anything has been\\ndone.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing that YOU would call anything has been done to-day,\" replies\\nMr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"Nor ever will be,\" says my Lady.\\n\\nSir Leicester has no objection to an interminable Chancery suit. It\\nis a slow, expensive, British, constitutional kind of thing. To be\\nsure, he has not a vital interest in the suit in question, her part\\nin which was the only property my Lady brought him; and he has a\\nshadowy impression that for his name--the name of Dedlock--to be in a\\ncause, and not in the title of that cause, is a most ridiculous\\naccident. But he regards the Court of Chancery, even if it should\\ninvolve an occasional delay of justice and a trifling amount of\\nconfusion, as a something devised in conjunction with a variety of\\nother somethings by the perfection of human wisdom for the eternal\\nsettlement (humanly speaking) of everything. And he is upon the whole\\nof a fixed opinion that to give the sanction of his countenance to\\nany complaints respecting it would be to encourage some person in the\\nlower classes to rise up somewhere--like Wat Tyler.\\n\\n\"As a few fresh affidavits have been put upon the file,\" says Mr.\\nTulkinghorn, \"and as they are short, and as I proceed upon the\\ntroublesome principle of begging leave to possess my clients with any\\nnew proceedings in a cause\"--cautious man Mr. Tulkinghorn, taking no\\nmore responsibility than necessary--\"and further, as I see you are\\ngoing to Paris, I have brought them in my pocket.\"\\n\\n(Sir Leicester was going to Paris too, by the by, but the delight of\\nthe fashionable intelligence was in his Lady.)\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn takes out his papers, asks permission to place them\\non a golden talisman of a table at my Lady\\'s elbow, puts on his\\nspectacles, and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp.\\n\\n\"\\'In Chancery. Between John Jarndyce--\\'\"\\n\\nMy Lady interrupts, requesting him to miss as many of the formal\\nhorrors as he can.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn glances over his spectacles and begins again lower\\ndown. My Lady carelessly and scornfully abstracts her attention. Sir\\nLeicester in a great chair looks at the file and appears to have a\\nstately liking for the legal repetitions and prolixities as ranging\\namong the national bulwarks. It happens that the fire is hot where my\\nLady sits and that the hand-screen is more beautiful than useful,\\nbeing priceless but small. My Lady, changing her position, sees the\\npapers on the table--looks at them nearer--looks at them nearer\\nstill--asks impulsively, \"Who copied that?\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn stops short, surprised by my Lady\\'s animation and her\\nunusual tone.\\n\\n\"Is it what you people call law-hand?\" she asks, looking full at him\\nin her careless way again and toying with her screen.\\n\\n\"Not quite. Probably\"--Mr. Tulkinghorn examines it as he speaks--\"the\\nlegal character which it has was acquired after the original hand was\\nformed. Why do you ask?\"\\n\\n\"Anything to vary this detestable monotony. Oh, go on, do!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn reads again. The heat is greater; my Lady screens her\\nface. Sir Leicester dozes, starts up suddenly, and cries, \"Eh? What\\ndo you say?\"\\n\\n\"I say I am afraid,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, who had risen hastily,\\n\"that Lady Dedlock is ill.\"\\n\\n\"Faint,\" my Lady murmurs with white lips, \"only that; but it is like\\nthe faintness of death. Don\\'t speak to me. Ring, and take me to my\\nroom!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn retires into another chamber; bells ring, feet\\nshuffle and patter, silence ensues. Mercury at last begs Mr.\\nTulkinghorn to return.\\n\\n\"Better now,\" quoth Sir Leicester, motioning the lawyer to sit down\\nand read to him alone. \"I have been quite alarmed. I never knew my\\nLady swoon before. But the weather is extremely trying, and she\\nreally has been bored to death down at our place in Lincolnshire.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my portion of\\nthese pages, for I know I am not clever. I always knew that. I can\\nremember, when I was a very little girl indeed, I used to say to my\\ndoll when we were alone together, \"Now, Dolly, I am not clever, you\\nknow very well, and you must be patient with me, like a dear!\" And so\\nshe used to sit propped up in a great arm-chair, with her beautiful\\ncomplexion and rosy lips, staring at me--or not so much at me, I\\nthink, as at nothing--while I busily stitched away and told her every\\none of my secrets.\\n\\nMy dear old doll! I was such a shy little thing that I seldom dared\\nto open my lips, and never dared to open my heart, to anybody else.\\nIt almost makes me cry to think what a relief it used to be to me\\nwhen I came home from school of a day to run upstairs to my room and\\nsay, \"Oh, you dear faithful Dolly, I knew you would be expecting me!\"\\nand then to sit down on the floor, leaning on the elbow of her great\\nchair, and tell her all I had noticed since we parted. I had always\\nrather a noticing way--not a quick way, oh, no!--a silent way of\\nnoticing what passed before me and thinking I should like to\\nunderstand it better. I have not by any means a quick understanding.\\nWhen I love a person very tenderly indeed, it seems to brighten. But\\neven that may be my vanity.\\n\\nI was brought up, from my earliest remembrance--like some of the\\nprincesses in the fairy stories, only I was not charming--by my\\ngodmother. At least, I only knew her as such. She was a good, good\\nwoman! She went to church three times every Sunday, and to morning\\nprayers on Wednesdays and Fridays, and to lectures whenever there\\nwere lectures; and never missed. She was handsome; and if she had\\never smiled, would have been (I used to think) like an angel--but she\\nnever smiled. She was always grave and strict. She was so very good\\nherself, I thought, that the badness of other people made her frown\\nall her life. I felt so different from her, even making every\\nallowance for the differences between a child and a woman; I felt so\\npoor, so trifling, and so far off that I never could be unrestrained\\nwith her--no, could never even love her as I wished. It made me very\\nsorry to consider how good she was and how unworthy of her I was, and\\nI used ardently to hope that I might have a better heart; and I\\ntalked it over very often with the dear old doll, but I never loved\\nmy godmother as I ought to have loved her and as I felt I must have\\nloved her if I had been a better girl.\\n\\nThis made me, I dare say, more timid and retiring than I naturally\\nwas and cast me upon Dolly as the only friend with whom I felt at\\nease. But something happened when I was still quite a little thing\\nthat helped it very much.\\n\\nI had never heard my mama spoken of. I had never heard of my papa\\neither, but I felt more interested about my mama. I had never worn a\\nblack frock, that I could recollect. I had never been shown my mama\\'s\\ngrave. I had never been told where it was. Yet I had never been\\ntaught to pray for any relation but my godmother. I had more than\\nonce approached this subject of my thoughts with Mrs. Rachael, our\\nonly servant, who took my light away when I was in bed (another very\\ngood woman, but austere to me), and she had only said, \"Esther, good\\nnight!\" and gone away and left me.\\n\\nAlthough there were seven girls at the neighbouring school where I\\nwas a day boarder, and although they called me little Esther\\nSummerson, I knew none of them at home. All of them were older than\\nI, to be sure (I was the youngest there by a good deal), but there\\nseemed to be some other separation between us besides that, and\\nbesides their being far more clever than I was and knowing much more\\nthan I did. One of them in the first week of my going to the school\\n(I remember it very well) invited me home to a little party, to my\\ngreat joy. But my godmother wrote a stiff letter declining for me,\\nand I never went. I never went out at all.\\n\\nIt was my birthday. There were holidays at school on other\\nbirthdays--none on mine. There were rejoicings at home on other\\nbirthdays, as I knew from what I heard the girls relate to one\\nanother--there were none on mine. My birthday was the most melancholy\\nday at home in the whole year.\\n\\nI have mentioned that unless my vanity should deceive me (as I know\\nit may, for I may be very vain without suspecting it, though indeed I\\ndon\\'t), my comprehension is quickened when my affection is. My\\ndisposition is very affectionate, and perhaps I might still feel such\\na wound if such a wound could be received more than once with the\\nquickness of that birthday.\\n\\nDinner was over, and my godmother and I were sitting at the table\\nbefore the fire. The clock ticked, the fire clicked; not another\\nsound had been heard in the room or in the house for I don\\'t know how\\nlong. I happened to look timidly up from my stitching, across the\\ntable at my godmother, and I saw in her face, looking gloomily at me,\\n\"It would have been far better, little Esther, that you had had no\\nbirthday, that you had never been born!\"\\n\\nI broke out crying and sobbing, and I said, \"Oh, dear godmother, tell\\nme, pray do tell me, did Mama die on my birthday?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" she returned. \"Ask me no more, child!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, do pray tell me something of her. Do now, at last, dear\\ngodmother, if you please! What did I do to her? How did I lose her?\\nWhy am I so different from other children, and why is it my fault,\\ndear godmother? No, no, no, don\\'t go away. Oh, speak to me!\"\\n\\nI was in a kind of fright beyond my grief, and I caught hold of her\\ndress and was kneeling to her. She had been saying all the while,\\n\"Let me go!\" But now she stood still.\\n\\nHer darkened face had such power over me that it stopped me in the\\nmidst of my vehemence. I put up my trembling little hand to clasp\\nhers or to beg her pardon with what earnestness I might, but withdrew\\nit as she looked at me, and laid it on my fluttering heart. She\\nraised me, sat in her chair, and standing me before her, said slowly\\nin a cold, low voice--I see her knitted brow and pointed\\nfinger--\"Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers.\\nThe time will come--and soon enough--when you will understand this\\nbetter and will feel it too, as no one save a woman can. I have\\nforgiven her\"--but her face did not relent--\"the wrong she did to me,\\nand I say no more of it, though it was greater than you will ever\\nknow--than any one will ever know but I, the sufferer. For yourself,\\nunfortunate girl, orphaned and degraded from the first of these evil\\nanniversaries, pray daily that the sins of others be not visited upon\\nyour head, according to what is written. Forget your mother and leave\\nall other people to forget her who will do her unhappy child that\\ngreatest kindness. Now, go!\"\\n\\nShe checked me, however, as I was about to depart from her--so frozen\\nas I was!--and added this, \"Submission, self-denial, diligent work,\\nare the preparations for a life begun with such a shadow on it. You\\nare different from other children, Esther, because you were not born,\\nlike them, in common sinfulness and wrath. You are set apart.\"\\n\\nI went up to my room, and crept to bed, and laid my doll\\'s cheek\\nagainst mine wet with tears, and holding that solitary friend upon my\\nbosom, cried myself to sleep. Imperfect as my understanding of my\\nsorrow was, I knew that I had brought no joy at any time to anybody\\'s\\nheart and that I was to no one upon earth what Dolly was to me.\\n\\nDear, dear, to think how much time we passed alone together\\nafterwards, and how often I repeated to the doll the story of my\\nbirthday and confided to her that I would try as hard as ever I could\\nto repair the fault I had been born with (of which I confessedly felt\\nguilty and yet innocent) and would strive as I grew up to be\\nindustrious, contented, and kind-hearted and to do some good to some\\none, and win some love to myself if I could. I hope it is not\\nself-indulgent to shed these tears as I think of it. I am very\\nthankful, I am very cheerful, but I cannot quite help their coming to\\nmy eyes.\\n\\nThere! I have wiped them away now and can go on again properly.\\n\\nI felt the distance between my godmother and myself so much more\\nafter the birthday, and felt so sensible of filling a place in her\\nhouse which ought to have been empty, that I found her more difficult\\nof approach, though I was fervently grateful to her in my heart, than\\never. I felt in the same way towards my school companions; I felt in\\nthe same way towards Mrs. Rachael, who was a widow; and oh, towards\\nher daughter, of whom she was proud, who came to see her once a\\nfortnight! I was very retired and quiet, and tried to be very\\ndiligent.\\n\\nOne sunny afternoon when I had come home from school with my books\\nand portfolio, watching my long shadow at my side, and as I was\\ngliding upstairs to my room as usual, my godmother looked out of the\\nparlour-door and called me back. Sitting with her, I found--which was\\nvery unusual indeed--a stranger. A portly, important-looking\\ngentleman, dressed all in black, with a white cravat, large gold\\nwatch seals, a pair of gold eye-glasses, and a large seal-ring upon\\nhis little finger.\\n\\n\"This,\" said my godmother in an undertone, \"is the child.\" Then she\\nsaid in her naturally stern way of speaking, \"This is Esther, sir.\"\\n\\nThe gentleman put up his eye-glasses to look at me and said, \"Come\\nhere, my dear!\" He shook hands with me and asked me to take off my\\nbonnet, looking at me all the while. When I had complied, he said,\\n\"Ah!\" and afterwards \"Yes!\" And then, taking off his eye-glasses and\\nfolding them in a red case, and leaning back in his arm-chair,\\nturning the case about in his two hands, he gave my godmother a nod.\\nUpon that, my godmother said, \"You may go upstairs, Esther!\" And I\\nmade him my curtsy and left him.\\n\\nIt must have been two years afterwards, and I was almost fourteen,\\nwhen one dreadful night my godmother and I sat at the fireside. I was\\nreading aloud, and she was listening. I had come down at nine o\\'clock\\nas I always did to read the Bible to her, and was reading from St.\\nJohn how our Saviour stooped down, writing with his finger in the\\ndust, when they brought the sinful woman to him.\\n\\n\"So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself and said\\nunto them, \\'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a\\nstone at her!\\'\"\\n\\nI was stopped by my godmother\\'s rising, putting her hand to her head,\\nand crying out in an awful voice from quite another part of the book,\\n\"\\'Watch ye, therefore, lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And\\nwhat I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch!\\'\"\\n\\nIn an instant, while she stood before me repeating these words, she\\nfell down on the floor. I had no need to cry out; her voice had\\nsounded through the house and been heard in the street.\\n\\nShe was laid upon her bed. For more than a week she lay there, little\\naltered outwardly, with her old handsome resolute frown that I so\\nwell knew carved upon her face. Many and many a time, in the day and\\nin the night, with my head upon the pillow by her that my whispers\\nmight be plainer to her, I kissed her, thanked her, prayed for her,\\nasked her for her blessing and forgiveness, entreated her to give me\\nthe least sign that she knew or heard me. No, no, no. Her face was\\nimmovable. To the very last, and even afterwards, her frown remained\\nunsoftened.\\n\\nOn the day after my poor good godmother was buried, the gentleman in\\nblack with the white neckcloth reappeared. I was sent for by Mrs.\\nRachael, and found him in the same place, as if he had never gone\\naway.\\n\\n\"My name is Kenge,\" he said; \"you may remember it, my child; Kenge\\nand Carboy, Lincoln\\'s Inn.\"\\n\\nI replied that I remembered to have seen him once before.\\n\\n\"Pray be seated--here near me. Don\\'t distress yourself; it\\'s of no\\nuse. Mrs. Rachael, I needn\\'t inform you who were acquainted with the\\nlate Miss Barbary\\'s affairs, that her means die with her and that\\nthis young lady, now her aunt is dead--\"\\n\\n\"My aunt, sir!\"\\n\\n\"It is really of no use carrying on a deception when no object is to\\nbe gained by it,\" said Mr. Kenge smoothly, \"Aunt in fact, though not\\nin law. Don\\'t distress yourself! Don\\'t weep! Don\\'t tremble! Mrs.\\nRachael, our young friend has no doubt heard of--the--a--Jarndyce and\\nJarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Never,\" said Mrs. Rachael.\\n\\n\"Is it possible,\" pursued Mr. Kenge, putting up his eye-glasses,\\n\"that our young friend--I BEG you won\\'t distress yourself!--never\\nheard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce!\"\\n\\nI shook my head, wondering even what it was.\\n\\n\"Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce?\" said Mr. Kenge, looking over his\\nglasses at me and softly turning the case about and about as if he\\nwere petting something. \"Not of one of the greatest Chancery suits\\nknown? Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce--the--a--in itself a monument of\\nChancery practice. In which (I would say) every difficulty, every\\ncontingency, every masterly fiction, every form of procedure known\\nin that court, is represented over and over again? It is a cause\\nthat could not exist out of this free and great country. I should\\nsay that the aggregate of costs in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mrs.\\nRachael\"--I was afraid he addressed himself to her because I appeared\\ninattentive\"--amounts at the present hour to from SIX-ty to SEVEN-ty\\nTHOUSAND POUNDS!\" said Mr. Kenge, leaning back in his chair.\\n\\nI felt very ignorant, but what could I do? I was so entirely\\nunacquainted with the subject that I understood nothing about it even\\nthen.\\n\\n\"And she really never heard of the cause!\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\"Surprising!\"\\n\\n\"Miss Barbary, sir,\" returned Mrs. Rachael, \"who is now among the\\nSeraphim--\"\\n\\n\"I hope so, I am sure,\" said Mr. Kenge politely.\\n\\n\"--Wished Esther only to know what would be serviceable to her. And\\nshe knows, from any teaching she has had here, nothing more.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Upon the whole, very proper. Now to the\\npoint,\" addressing me. \"Miss Barbary, your sole relation (in fact\\nthat is, for I am bound to observe that in law you had none) being\\ndeceased and it naturally not being to be expected that Mrs.\\nRachael--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear no!\" said Mrs. Rachael quickly.\\n\\n\"Quite so,\" assented Mr. Kenge; \"--that Mrs. Rachael should charge\\nherself with your maintenance and support (I beg you won\\'t distress\\nyourself), you are in a position to receive the renewal of an offer\\nwhich I was instructed to make to Miss Barbary some two years ago and\\nwhich, though rejected then, was understood to be renewable under the\\nlamentable circumstances that have since occurred. Now, if I avow\\nthat I represent, in Jarndyce and Jarndyce and otherwise, a highly\\nhumane, but at the same time singular, man, shall I compromise myself\\nby any stretch of my professional caution?\" said Mr. Kenge, leaning\\nback in his chair again and looking calmly at us both.\\n\\nHe appeared to enjoy beyond everything the sound of his own voice. I\\ncouldn\\'t wonder at that, for it was mellow and full and gave great\\nimportance to every word he uttered. He listened to himself with\\nobvious satisfaction and sometimes gently beat time to his own music\\nwith his head or rounded a sentence with his hand. I was very much\\nimpressed by him--even then, before I knew that he formed himself on\\nthe model of a great lord who was his client and that he was\\ngenerally called Conversation Kenge.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he pursued, \"being aware of the--I would say,\\ndesolate--position of our young friend, offers to place her at a\\nfirst-rate establishment where her education shall be completed,\\nwhere her comfort shall be secured, where her reasonable wants shall\\nbe anticipated, where she shall be eminently qualified to discharge\\nher duty in that station of life unto which it has pleased--shall I\\nsay Providence?--to call her.\"\\n\\nMy heart was filled so full, both by what he said and by his\\naffecting manner of saying it, that I was not able to speak, though I\\ntried.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he went on, \"makes no condition beyond expressing his\\nexpectation that our young friend will not at any time remove herself\\nfrom the establishment in question without his knowledge and\\nconcurrence. That she will faithfully apply herself to the\\nacquisition of those accomplishments, upon the exercise of which she\\nwill be ultimately dependent. That she will tread in the paths of\\nvirtue and honour, and--the--a--so forth.\"\\n\\nI was still less able to speak than before.\\n\\n\"Now, what does our young friend say?\" proceeded Mr. Kenge. \"Take\\ntime, take time! I pause for her reply. But take time!\"\\n\\nWhat the destitute subject of such an offer tried to say, I need not\\nrepeat. What she did say, I could more easily tell, if it were worth\\nthe telling. What she felt, and will feel to her dying hour, I could\\nnever relate.\\n\\nThis interview took place at Windsor, where I had passed (as far as I\\nknew) my whole life. On that day week, amply provided with all\\nnecessaries, I left it, inside the stagecoach, for Reading.\\n\\nMrs. Rachael was too good to feel any emotion at parting, but I was\\nnot so good, and wept bitterly. I thought that I ought to have known\\nher better after so many years and ought to have made myself enough\\nof a favourite with her to make her sorry then. When she gave me one\\ncold parting kiss upon my forehead, like a thaw-drop from the stone\\nporch--it was a very frosty day--I felt so miserable and\\nself-reproachful that I clung to her and told her it was my fault, I\\nknew, that she could say good-bye so easily!\\n\\n\"No, Esther!\" she returned. \"It is your misfortune!\"\\n\\nThe coach was at the little lawn-gate--we had not come out until we\\nheard the wheels--and thus I left her, with a sorrowful heart. She\\nwent in before my boxes were lifted to the coach-roof and shut the\\ndoor. As long as I could see the house, I looked back at it from the\\nwindow through my tears. My godmother had left Mrs. Rachael all the\\nlittle property she possessed; and there was to be a sale; and an old\\nhearth-rug with roses on it, which always seemed to me the first\\nthing in the world I had ever seen, was hanging outside in the frost\\nand snow. A day or two before, I had wrapped the dear old doll in her\\nown shawl and quietly laid her--I am half ashamed to tell it--in the\\ngarden-earth under the tree that shaded my old window. I had no\\ncompanion left but my bird, and him I carried with me in his cage.\\n\\nWhen the house was out of sight, I sat, with my bird-cage in the\\nstraw at my feet, forward on the low seat to look out of the high\\nwindow, watching the frosty trees, that were like beautiful pieces of\\nspar, and the fields all smooth and white with last night\\'s snow, and\\nthe sun, so red but yielding so little heat, and the ice, dark like\\nmetal where the skaters and sliders had brushed the snow away. There\\nwas a gentleman in the coach who sat on the opposite seat and looked\\nvery large in a quantity of wrappings, but he sat gazing out of the\\nother window and took no notice of me.\\n\\nI thought of my dead godmother, of the night when I read to her, of\\nher frowning so fixedly and sternly in her bed, of the strange place\\nI was going to, of the people I should find there, and what they\\nwould be like, and what they would say to me, when a voice in the\\ncoach gave me a terrible start.\\n\\nIt said, \"What the de-vil are you crying for?\"\\n\\nI was so frightened that I lost my voice and could only answer in a\\nwhisper, \"Me, sir?\" For of course I knew it must have been the\\ngentleman in the quantity of wrappings, though he was still looking\\nout of his window.\\n\\n\"Yes, you,\" he said, turning round.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know I was crying, sir,\" I faltered.\\n\\n\"But you are!\" said the gentleman. \"Look here!\" He came quite\\nopposite to me from the other corner of the coach, brushed one of his\\nlarge furry cuffs across my eyes (but without hurting me), and showed\\nme that it was wet.\\n\\n\"There! Now you know you are,\" he said. \"Don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said.\\n\\n\"And what are you crying for?\" said the gentleman, \"Don\\'t you want to\\ngo there?\"\\n\\n\"Where, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Where? Why, wherever you are going,\" said the gentleman.\\n\\n\"I am very glad to go there, sir,\" I answered.\\n\\n\"Well, then! Look glad!\" said the gentleman.\\n\\nI thought he was very strange, or at least that what I could see of\\nhim was very strange, for he was wrapped up to the chin, and his face\\nwas almost hidden in a fur cap with broad fur straps at the side of\\nhis head fastened under his chin; but I was composed again, and not\\nafraid of him. So I told him that I thought I must have been crying\\nbecause of my godmother\\'s death and because of Mrs. Rachael\\'s not\\nbeing sorry to part with me.\\n\\n\"Confound Mrs. Rachael!\" said the gentleman. \"Let her fly away in a\\nhigh wind on a broomstick!\"\\n\\nI began to be really afraid of him now and looked at him with the\\ngreatest astonishment. But I thought that he had pleasant eyes,\\nalthough he kept on muttering to himself in an angry manner and\\ncalling Mrs. Rachael names.\\n\\nAfter a little while he opened his outer wrapper, which appeared to\\nme large enough to wrap up the whole coach, and put his arm down into\\na deep pocket in the side.\\n\\n\"Now, look here!\" he said. \"In this paper,\" which was nicely folded,\\n\"is a piece of the best plum-cake that can be got for money--sugar on\\nthe outside an inch thick, like fat on mutton chops. Here\\'s a little\\npie (a gem this is, both for size and quality), made in France. And\\nwhat do you suppose it\\'s made of? Livers of fat geese. There\\'s a pie!\\nNow let\\'s see you eat \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir,\" I replied; \"thank you very much indeed, but I hope\\nyou won\\'t be offended--they are too rich for me.\"\\n\\n\"Floored again!\" said the gentleman, which I didn\\'t at all\\nunderstand, and threw them both out of window.\\n\\nHe did not speak to me any more until he got out of the coach a\\nlittle way short of Reading, when he advised me to be a good girl and\\nto be studious, and shook hands with me. I must say I was relieved by\\nhis departure. We left him at a milestone. I often walked past it\\nafterwards, and never for a long time without thinking of him and\\nhalf expecting to meet him. But I never did; and so, as time went on,\\nhe passed out of my mind.\\n\\nWhen the coach stopped, a very neat lady looked up at the window and\\nsaid, \"Miss Donny.\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, Esther Summerson.\"\\n\\n\"That is quite right,\" said the lady, \"Miss Donny.\"\\n\\nI now understood that she introduced herself by that name, and begged\\nMiss Donny\\'s pardon for my mistake, and pointed out my boxes at her\\nrequest. Under the direction of a very neat maid, they were put\\noutside a very small green carriage; and then Miss Donny, the maid,\\nand I got inside and were driven away.\\n\\n\"Everything is ready for you, Esther,\" said Miss Donny, \"and the\\nscheme of your pursuits has been arranged in exact accordance with\\nthe wishes of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Of--did you say, ma\\'am?\"\\n\\n\"Of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce,\" said Miss Donny.\\n\\nI was so bewildered that Miss Donny thought the cold had been too\\nsevere for me and lent me her smelling-bottle.\\n\\n\"Do you know my--guardian, Mr. Jarndyce, ma\\'am?\" I asked after a good\\ndeal of hesitation.\\n\\n\"Not personally, Esther,\" said Miss Donny; \"merely through his\\nsolicitors, Messrs. Kenge and Carboy, of London. A very superior\\ngentleman, Mr. Kenge. Truly eloquent indeed. Some of his periods\\nquite majestic!\"\\n\\nI felt this to be very true but was too confused to attend to it. Our\\nspeedy arrival at our destination, before I had time to recover\\nmyself, increased my confusion, and I never shall forget the\\nuncertain and the unreal air of everything at Greenleaf (Miss Donny\\'s\\nhouse) that afternoon!\\n\\nBut I soon became used to it. I was so adapted to the routine of\\nGreenleaf before long that I seemed to have been there a great while\\nand almost to have dreamed rather than really lived my old life at my\\ngodmother\\'s. Nothing could be more precise, exact, and orderly than\\nGreenleaf. There was a time for everything all round the dial of the\\nclock, and everything was done at its appointed moment.\\n\\nWe were twelve boarders, and there were two Miss Donnys, twins. It\\nwas understood that I would have to depend, by and by, on my\\nqualifications as a governess, and I was not only instructed in\\neverything that was taught at Greenleaf, but was very soon engaged in\\nhelping to instruct others. Although I was treated in every other\\nrespect like the rest of the school, this single difference was made\\nin my case from the first. As I began to know more, I taught more,\\nand so in course of time I had plenty to do, which I was very fond of\\ndoing because it made the dear girls fond of me. At last, whenever a\\nnew pupil came who was a little downcast and unhappy, she was so\\nsure--indeed I don\\'t know why--to make a friend of me that all\\nnew-comers were confided to my care. They said I was so gentle, but I\\nam sure THEY were! I often thought of the resolution I had made on my\\nbirthday to try to be industrious, contented, and true-hearted and to\\ndo some good to some one and win some love if I could; and indeed,\\nindeed, I felt almost ashamed to have done so little and have won so\\nmuch.\\n\\nI passed at Greenleaf six happy, quiet years. I never saw in any face\\nthere, thank heaven, on my birthday, that it would have been better\\nif I had never been born. When the day came round, it brought me so\\nmany tokens of affectionate remembrance that my room was beautiful\\nwith them from New Year\\'s Day to Christmas.\\n\\nIn those six years I had never been away except on visits at holiday\\ntime in the neighbourhood. After the first six months or so I had\\ntaken Miss Donny\\'s advice in reference to the propriety of writing to\\nMr. Kenge to say that I was happy and grateful, and with her approval\\nI had written such a letter. I had received a formal answer\\nacknowledging its receipt and saying, \"We note the contents thereof,\\nwhich shall be duly communicated to our client.\" After that I\\nsometimes heard Miss Donny and her sister mention how regular my\\naccounts were paid, and about twice a year I ventured to write a\\nsimilar letter. I always received by return of post exactly the same\\nanswer in the same round hand, with the signature of Kenge and Carboy\\nin another writing, which I supposed to be Mr. Kenge\\'s.\\n\\nIt seems so curious to me to be obliged to write all this about\\nmyself! As if this narrative were the narrative of MY life! But my\\nlittle body will soon fall into the background now.\\n\\nSix quiet years (I find I am saying it for the second time) I had\\npassed at Greenleaf, seeing in those around me, as it might be in a\\nlooking-glass, every stage of my own growth and change there, when,\\none November morning, I received this letter. I omit the date.\\n\\n\\n   Old Square, Lincoln\\'s Inn\\n\\n   Madam,\\n\\n   Jarndyce and Jarndyce\\n\\n   Our clt Mr. Jarndyce being abt to rece into his house,\\n   under an Order of the Ct of Chy, a Ward of the Ct in this\\n   cause, for whom he wishes to secure an elgble compn,\\n   directs us to inform you that he will be glad of your\\n   serces in the afsd capacity.\\n\\n   We have arrngd for your being forded, carriage free, pr\\n   eight o\\'clock coach from Reading, on Monday morning next,\\n   to White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly, London, where one of\\n   our clks will be in waiting to convey you to our offe as\\n   above.\\n\\n   We are, Madam, Your obedt Servts,\\n\\n   Kenge and Carboy\\n\\n   Miss Esther Summerson\\n\\n\\nOh, never, never, never shall I forget the emotion this letter caused\\nin the house! It was so tender in them to care so much for me, it was\\nso gracious in that father who had not forgotten me to have made my\\norphan way so smooth and easy and to have inclined so many youthful\\nnatures towards me, that I could hardly bear it. Not that I would\\nhave had them less sorry--I am afraid not; but the pleasure of it,\\nand the pain of it, and the pride and joy of it, and the humble\\nregret of it were so blended that my heart seemed almost breaking\\nwhile it was full of rapture.\\n\\nThe letter gave me only five days\\' notice of my removal. When every\\nminute added to the proofs of love and kindness that were given me in\\nthose five days, and when at last the morning came and when they took\\nme through all the rooms that I might see them for the last time, and\\nwhen some cried, \"Esther, dear, say good-bye to me here at my\\nbedside, where you first spoke so kindly to me!\" and when others\\nasked me only to write their names, \"With Esther\\'s love,\" and when\\nthey all surrounded me with their parting presents and clung to me\\nweeping and cried, \"What shall we do when dear, dear Esther\\'s gone!\"\\nand when I tried to tell them how forbearing and how good they had\\nall been to me and how I blessed and thanked them every one, what a\\nheart I had!\\n\\nAnd when the two Miss Donnys grieved as much to part with me as the\\nleast among them, and when the maids said, \"Bless you, miss, wherever\\nyou go!\" and when the ugly lame old gardener, who I thought had\\nhardly noticed me in all those years, came panting after the coach to\\ngive me a little nosegay of geraniums and told me I had been the\\nlight of his eyes--indeed the old man said so!--what a heart I had\\nthen!\\n\\nAnd could I help it if with all this, and the coming to the little\\nschool, and the unexpected sight of the poor children outside waving\\ntheir hats and bonnets to me, and of a grey-haired gentleman and lady\\nwhose daughter I had helped to teach and at whose house I had visited\\n(who were said to be the proudest people in all that country), caring\\nfor nothing but calling out, \"Good-bye, Esther. May you be very\\nhappy!\"--could I help it if I was quite bowed down in the coach by\\nmyself and said \"Oh, I am so thankful, I am so thankful!\" many times\\nover!\\n\\nBut of course I soon considered that I must not take tears where I\\nwas going after all that had been done for me. Therefore, of course,\\nI made myself sob less and persuaded myself to be quiet by saying\\nvery often, \"Esther, now you really must! This WILL NOT do!\" I\\ncheered myself up pretty well at last, though I am afraid I was\\nlonger about it than I ought to have been; and when I had cooled my\\neyes with lavender water, it was time to watch for London.\\n\\nI was quite persuaded that we were there when we were ten miles off,\\nand when we really were there, that we should never get there.\\nHowever, when we began to jolt upon a stone pavement, and\\nparticularly when every other conveyance seemed to be running into\\nus, and we seemed to be running into every other conveyance, I began\\nto believe that we really were approaching the end of our journey.\\nVery soon afterwards we stopped.\\n\\nA young gentleman who had inked himself by accident addressed me from\\nthe pavement and said, \"I am from Kenge and Carboy\\'s, miss, of\\nLincoln\\'s Inn.\"\\n\\n\"If you please, sir,\" said I.\\n\\nHe was very obliging, and as he handed me into a fly after\\nsuperintending the removal of my boxes, I asked him whether there was\\na great fire anywhere? For the streets were so full of dense brown\\nsmoke that scarcely anything was to be seen.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear no, miss,\" he said. \"This is a London particular.\"\\n\\nI had never heard of such a thing.\\n\\n\"A fog, miss,\" said the young gentleman.\\n\\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said I.\\n\\nWe drove slowly through the dirtiest and darkest streets that ever\\nwere seen in the world (I thought) and in such a distracting state of\\nconfusion that I wondered how the people kept their senses, until we\\npassed into sudden quietude under an old gateway and drove on through\\na silent square until we came to an odd nook in a corner, where there\\nwas an entrance up a steep, broad flight of stairs, like an entrance\\nto a church. And there really was a churchyard outside under some\\ncloisters, for I saw the gravestones from the staircase window.\\n\\nThis was Kenge and Carboy\\'s. The young gentleman showed me through an\\nouter office into Mr. Kenge\\'s room--there was no one in it--and\\npolitely put an arm-chair for me by the fire. He then called my\\nattention to a little looking-glass hanging from a nail on one side\\nof the chimney-piece.\\n\\n\"In case you should wish to look at yourself, miss, after the\\njourney, as you\\'re going before the Chancellor. Not that it\\'s\\nrequisite, I am sure,\" said the young gentleman civilly.\\n\\n\"Going before the Chancellor?\" I said, startled for a moment.\\n\\n\"Only a matter of form, miss,\" returned the young gentleman. \"Mr.\\nKenge is in court now. He left his compliments, and would you partake\\nof some refreshment\"--there were biscuits and a decanter of wine on a\\nsmall table--\"and look over the paper,\" which the young gentleman\\ngave me as he spoke. He then stirred the fire and left me.\\n\\nEverything was so strange--the stranger from its being night in the\\nday-time, the candles burning with a white flame, and looking raw and\\ncold--that I read the words in the newspaper without knowing what\\nthey meant and found myself reading the same words repeatedly. As it\\nwas of no use going on in that way, I put the paper down, took a peep\\nat my bonnet in the glass to see if it was neat, and looked at the\\nroom, which was not half lighted, and at the shabby, dusty tables,\\nand at the piles of writings, and at a bookcase full of the most\\ninexpressive-looking books that ever had anything to say for\\nthemselves. Then I went on, thinking, thinking, thinking; and the\\nfire went on, burning, burning, burning; and the candles went on\\nflickering and guttering, and there were no snuffers--until the young\\ngentleman by and by brought a very dirty pair--for two hours.\\n\\nAt last Mr. Kenge came. HE was not altered, but he was surprised to\\nsee how altered I was and appeared quite pleased. \"As you are going\\nto be the companion of the young lady who is now in the Chancellor\\'s\\nprivate room, Miss Summerson,\" he said, \"we thought it well that you\\nshould be in attendance also. You will not be discomposed by the Lord\\nChancellor, I dare say?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" I said, \"I don\\'t think I shall,\" really not seeing on\\nconsideration why I should be.\\n\\nSo Mr. Kenge gave me his arm and we went round the corner, under a\\ncolonnade, and in at a side door. And so we came, along a passage,\\ninto a comfortable sort of room where a young lady and a young\\ngentleman were standing near a great, loud-roaring fire. A screen was\\ninterposed between them and it, and they were leaning on the screen,\\ntalking.\\n\\nThey both looked up when I came in, and I saw in the young lady, with\\nthe fire shining upon her, such a beautiful girl! With such rich\\ngolden hair, such soft blue eyes, and such a bright, innocent,\\ntrusting face!\\n\\n\"Miss Ada,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"this is Miss Summerson.\"\\n\\nShe came to meet me with a smile of welcome and her hand extended,\\nbut seemed to change her mind in a moment and kissed me. In short,\\nshe had such a natural, captivating, winning manner that in a few\\nminutes we were sitting in the window-seat, with the light of the\\nfire upon us, talking together as free and happy as could be.\\n\\nWhat a load off my mind! It was so delightful to know that she could\\nconfide in me and like me! It was so good of her, and so encouraging\\nto me!\\n\\nThe young gentleman was her distant cousin, she told me, and his name\\nRichard Carstone. He was a handsome youth with an ingenuous face and\\na most engaging laugh; and after she had called him up to where we\\nsat, he stood by us, in the light of the fire, talking gaily, like a\\nlight-hearted boy. He was very young, not more than nineteen then, if\\nquite so much, but nearly two years older than she was. They were\\nboth orphans and (what was very unexpected and curious to me) had\\nnever met before that day. Our all three coming together for the\\nfirst time in such an unusual place was a thing to talk about, and we\\ntalked about it; and the fire, which had left off roaring, winked its\\nred eyes at us--as Richard said--like a drowsy old Chancery lion.\\n\\nWe conversed in a low tone because a full-dressed gentleman in a bag\\nwig frequently came in and out, and when he did so, we could hear a\\ndrawling sound in the distance, which he said was one of the counsel\\nin our case addressing the Lord Chancellor. He told Mr. Kenge that\\nthe Chancellor would be up in five minutes; and presently we heard a\\nbustle and a tread of feet, and Mr. Kenge said that the Court had\\nrisen and his lordship was in the next room.\\n\\nThe gentleman in the bag wig opened the door almost directly and\\nrequested Mr. Kenge to come in. Upon that, we all went into the next\\nroom, Mr. Kenge first, with my darling--it is so natural to me now\\nthat I can\\'t help writing it; and there, plainly dressed in black and\\nsitting in an arm-chair at a table near the fire, was his lordship,\\nwhose robe, trimmed with beautiful gold lace, was thrown upon another\\nchair. He gave us a searching look as we entered, but his manner was\\nboth courtly and kind.\\n\\nThe gentleman in the bag wig laid bundles of papers on his lordship\\'s\\ntable, and his lordship silently selected one and turned over the\\nleaves.\\n\\n\"Miss Clare,\" said the Lord Chancellor. \"Miss Ada Clare?\"\\n\\nMr. Kenge presented her, and his lordship begged her to sit down near\\nhim. That he admired her and was interested by her even I could see\\nin a moment. It touched me that the home of such a beautiful young\\ncreature should be represented by that dry, official place. The Lord\\nHigh Chancellor, at his best, appeared so poor a substitute for the\\nlove and pride of parents.\\n\\n\"The Jarndyce in question,\" said the Lord Chancellor, still turning\\nover leaves, \"is Jarndyce of Bleak House.\"\\n\\n\"Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\\n\"A dreary name,\" said the Lord Chancellor.\\n\\n\"But not a dreary place at present, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\\n\"And Bleak House,\" said his lordship, \"is in--\"\\n\\n\"Hertfordshire, my lord.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House is not married?\" said his lordship.\\n\\n\"He is not, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\\nA pause.\\n\\n\"Young Mr. Richard Carstone is present?\" said the Lord Chancellor,\\nglancing towards him.\\n\\nRichard bowed and stepped forward.\\n\\n\"Hum!\" said the Lord Chancellor, turning over more leaves.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,\" Mr. Kenge observed in a low\\nvoice, \"if I may venture to remind your lordship, provides a suitable\\ncompanion for--\"\\n\\n\"For Mr. Richard Carstone?\" I thought (but I am not quite sure) I\\nheard his lordship say in an equally low voice and with a smile.\\n\\n\"For Miss Ada Clare. This is the young lady. Miss Summerson.\"\\n\\nHis lordship gave me an indulgent look and acknowledged my curtsy\\nvery graciously.\\n\\n\"Miss Summerson is not related to any party in the cause, I think?\"\\n\\n\"No, my lord.\"\\n\\nMr. Kenge leant over before it was quite said and whispered. His\\nlordship, with his eyes upon his papers, listened, nodded twice or\\nthrice, turned over more leaves, and did not look towards me again\\nuntil we were going away.\\n\\nMr. Kenge now retired, and Richard with him, to where I was, near the\\ndoor, leaving my pet (it is so natural to me that again I can\\'t help\\nit!) sitting near the Lord Chancellor, with whom his lordship spoke a\\nlittle part, asking her, as she told me afterwards, whether she had\\nwell reflected on the proposed arrangement, and if she thought she\\nwould be happy under the roof of Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, and why\\nshe thought so? Presently he rose courteously and released her, and\\nthen he spoke for a minute or two with Richard Carstone, not seated,\\nbut standing, and altogether with more ease and less ceremony, as if\\nhe still knew, though he WAS Lord Chancellor, how to go straight to\\nthe candour of a boy.\\n\\n\"Very well!\" said his lordship aloud. \"I shall make the order. Mr.\\nJarndyce of Bleak House has chosen, so far as I may judge,\" and this\\nwas when he looked at me, \"a very good companion for the young lady,\\nand the arrangement altogether seems the best of which the\\ncircumstances admit.\"\\n\\nHe dismissed us pleasantly, and we all went out, very much obliged to\\nhim for being so affable and polite, by which he had certainly lost\\nno dignity but seemed to us to have gained some.\\n\\nWhen we got under the colonnade, Mr. Kenge remembered that he must go\\nback for a moment to ask a question and left us in the fog, with the\\nLord Chancellor\\'s carriage and servants waiting for him to come out.\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Richard Carstone. \"THAT\\'S over! And where do we go next,\\nMiss Summerson?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you know?\" I said.\\n\\n\"Not in the least,\" said he.\\n\\n\"And don\\'t YOU know, my love?\" I asked Ada.\\n\\n\"No!\" said she. \"Don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all!\" said I.\\n\\nWe looked at one another, half laughing at our being like the\\nchildren in the wood, when a curious little old woman in a squeezed\\nbonnet and carrying a reticule came curtsying and smiling up to us\\nwith an air of great ceremony.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said she. \"The wards in Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy, I am sure, to\\nhave the honour! It is a good omen for youth, and hope, and beauty\\nwhen they find themselves in this place, and don\\'t know what\\'s to\\ncome of it.\"\\n\\n\"Mad!\" whispered Richard, not thinking she could hear him.\\n\\n\"Right! Mad, young gentleman,\" she returned so quickly that he was\\nquite abashed. \"I was a ward myself. I was not mad at that time,\"\\ncurtsying low and smiling between every little sentence. \"I had youth\\nand hope. I believe, beauty. It matters very little now. Neither of\\nthe three served or saved me. I have the honour to attend court\\nregularly. With my documents. I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the\\nDay of Judgment. I have discovered that the sixth seal mentioned in\\nthe Revelations is the Great Seal. It has been open a long time! Pray\\naccept my blessing.\"\\n\\nAs Ada was a little frightened, I said, to humour the poor old lady,\\nthat we were much obliged to her.\\n\\n\"Ye-es!\" she said mincingly. \"I imagine so. And here is Conversation\\nKenge. With HIS documents! How does your honourable worship do?\"\\n\\n\"Quite well, quite well! Now don\\'t be troublesome, that\\'s a good\\nsoul!\" said Mr. Kenge, leading the way back.\\n\\n\"By no means,\" said the poor old lady, keeping up with Ada and me.\\n\"Anything but troublesome. I shall confer estates on both--which is\\nnot being troublesome, I trust? I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the\\nDay of Judgment. This is a good omen for you. Accept my blessing!\"\\n\\nShe stopped at the bottom of the steep, broad flight of stairs; but\\nwe looked back as we went up, and she was still there, saying, still\\nwith a curtsy and a smile between every little sentence, \"Youth. And\\nhope. And beauty. And Chancery. And Conversation Kenge! Ha! Pray\\naccept my blessing!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWe were to pass the night, Mr. Kenge told us when we arrived in his\\nroom, at Mrs. Jellyby\\'s; and then he turned to me and said he took it\\nfor granted I knew who Mrs. Jellyby was.\\n\\n\"I really don\\'t, sir,\" I returned. \"Perhaps Mr. Carstone--or Miss\\nClare--\"\\n\\nBut no, they knew nothing whatever about Mrs. Jellyby. \"In-deed! Mrs.\\nJellyby,\" said Mr. Kenge, standing with his back to the fire and\\ncasting his eyes over the dusty hearth-rug as if it were Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s biography, \"is a lady of very remarkable strength of\\ncharacter who devotes herself entirely to the public. She has devoted\\nherself to an extensive variety of public subjects at various times\\nand is at present (until something else attracts her) devoted to the\\nsubject of Africa, with a view to the general cultivation of the\\ncoffee berry--AND the natives--and the happy settlement, on the banks\\nof the African rivers, of our superabundant home population. Mr.\\nJarndyce, who is desirous to aid any work that is considered likely\\nto be a good work and who is much sought after by philanthropists,\\nhas, I believe, a very high opinion of Mrs. Jellyby.\"\\n\\nMr. Kenge, adjusting his cravat, then looked at us.\\n\\n\"And Mr. Jellyby, sir?\" suggested Richard.\\n\\n\"Ah! Mr. Jellyby,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"is--a--I don\\'t know that I can\\ndescribe him to you better than by saying that he is the husband of\\nMrs. Jellyby.\"\\n\\n\"A nonentity, sir?\" said Richard with a droll look.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t say that,\" returned Mr. Kenge gravely. \"I can\\'t say that,\\nindeed, for I know nothing whatever OF Mr. Jellyby. I never, to my\\nknowledge, had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jellyby. He may be a very\\nsuperior man, but he is, so to speak, merged--merged--in the more\\nshining qualities of his wife.\" Mr. Kenge proceeded to tell us that\\nas the road to Bleak House would have been very long, dark, and\\ntedious on such an evening, and as we had been travelling already,\\nMr. Jarndyce had himself proposed this arrangement. A carriage would\\nbe at Mrs. Jellyby\\'s to convey us out of town early in the forenoon\\nof to-morrow.\\n\\nHe then rang a little bell, and the young gentleman came in.\\nAddressing him by the name of Guppy, Mr. Kenge inquired whether Miss\\nSummerson\\'s boxes and the rest of the baggage had been \"sent round.\"\\nMr. Guppy said yes, they had been sent round, and a coach was waiting\\nto take us round too as soon as we pleased.\\n\\n\"Then it only remains,\" said Mr. Kenge, shaking hands with us, \"for\\nme to express my lively satisfaction in (good day, Miss Clare!) the\\narrangement this day concluded and my (GOOD-bye to you, Miss\\nSummerson!) lively hope that it will conduce to the happiness, the\\n(glad to have had the honour of making your acquaintance, Mr.\\nCarstone!) welfare, the advantage in all points of view, of all\\nconcerned! Guppy, see the party safely there.\"\\n\\n\"Where IS \\'there,\\' Mr. Guppy?\" said Richard as we went downstairs.\\n\\n\"No distance,\" said Mr. Guppy; \"round in Thavies Inn, you know.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t say I know where it is, for I come from Winchester and am\\nstrange in London.\"\\n\\n\"Only round the corner,\" said Mr. Guppy. \"We just twist up Chancery\\nLane, and cut along Holborn, and there we are in four minutes\\' time,\\nas near as a toucher. This is about a London particular NOW, ain\\'t\\nit, miss?\" He seemed quite delighted with it on my account.\\n\\n\"The fog is very dense indeed!\" said I.\\n\\n\"Not that it affects you, though, I\\'m sure,\" said Mr. Guppy, putting\\nup the steps. \"On the contrary, it seems to do you good, miss,\\njudging from your appearance.\"\\n\\nI knew he meant well in paying me this compliment, so I laughed at\\nmyself for blushing at it when he had shut the door and got upon the\\nbox; and we all three laughed and chatted about our inexperience and\\nthe strangeness of London until we turned up under an archway to our\\ndestination--a narrow street of high houses like an oblong cistern to\\nhold the fog. There was a confused little crowd of people,\\nprincipally children, gathered about the house at which we stopped,\\nwhich had a tarnished brass plate on the door with the inscription\\nJELLYBY.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be frightened!\" said Mr. Guppy, looking in at the\\ncoach-window. \"One of the young Jellybys been and got his head\\nthrough the area railings!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, poor child,\" said I; \"let me out, if you please!\"\\n\\n\"Pray be careful of yourself, miss. The young Jellybys are always up\\nto something,\" said Mr. Guppy.\\n\\nI made my way to the poor child, who was one of the dirtiest little\\nunfortunates I ever saw, and found him very hot and frightened and\\ncrying loudly, fixed by the neck between two iron railings, while a\\nmilkman and a beadle, with the kindest intentions possible, were\\nendeavouring to drag him back by the legs, under a general impression\\nthat his skull was compressible by those means. As I found (after\\npacifying him) that he was a little boy with a naturally large head,\\nI thought that perhaps where his head could go, his body could\\nfollow, and mentioned that the best mode of extrication might be to\\npush him forward. This was so favourably received by the milkman and\\nbeadle that he would immediately have been pushed into the area if I\\nhad not held his pinafore while Richard and Mr. Guppy ran down\\nthrough the kitchen to catch him when he should be released. At last\\nhe was happily got down without any accident, and then he began to\\nbeat Mr. Guppy with a hoop-stick in quite a frantic manner.\\n\\nNobody had appeared belonging to the house except a person in\\npattens, who had been poking at the child from below with a broom; I\\ndon\\'t know with what object, and I don\\'t think she did. I therefore\\nsupposed that Mrs. Jellyby was not at home, and was quite surprised\\nwhen the person appeared in the passage without the pattens, and\\ngoing up to the back room on the first floor before Ada and me,\\nannounced us as, \"Them two young ladies, Missis Jellyby!\" We passed\\nseveral more children on the way up, whom it was difficult to avoid\\ntreading on in the dark; and as we came into Mrs. Jellyby\\'s presence,\\none of the poor little things fell downstairs--down a whole flight\\n(as it sounded to me), with a great noise.\\n\\nMrs. Jellyby, whose face reflected none of the uneasiness which we\\ncould not help showing in our own faces as the dear child\\'s head\\nrecorded its passage with a bump on every stair--Richard afterwards\\nsaid he counted seven, besides one for the landing--received us with\\nperfect equanimity. She was a pretty, very diminutive, plump woman of\\nfrom forty to fifty, with handsome eyes, though they had a curious\\nhabit of seeming to look a long way off. As if--I am quoting Richard\\nagain--they could see nothing nearer than Africa!\\n\\n\"I am very glad indeed,\" said Mrs. Jellyby in an agreeable voice, \"to\\nhave the pleasure of receiving you. I have a great respect for Mr.\\nJarndyce, and no one in whom he is interested can be an object of\\nindifference to me.\"\\n\\nWe expressed our acknowledgments and sat down behind the door, where\\nthere was a lame invalid of a sofa. Mrs. Jellyby had very good hair\\nbut was too much occupied with her African duties to brush it. The\\nshawl in which she had been loosely muffled dropped onto her chair\\nwhen she advanced to us; and as she turned to resume her seat, we\\ncould not help noticing that her dress didn\\'t nearly meet up the back\\nand that the open space was railed across with a lattice-work of\\nstay-lace--like a summer-house.\\n\\nThe room, which was strewn with papers and nearly filled by a great\\nwriting-table covered with similar litter, was, I must say, not only\\nvery untidy but very dirty. We were obliged to take notice of that\\nwith our sense of sight, even while, with our sense of hearing, we\\nfollowed the poor child who had tumbled downstairs: I think into the\\nback kitchen, where somebody seemed to stifle him.\\n\\nBut what principally struck us was a jaded and unhealthy-looking\\nthough by no means plain girl at the writing-table, who sat biting\\nthe feather of her pen and staring at us. I suppose nobody ever was\\nin such a state of ink. And from her tumbled hair to her pretty feet,\\nwhich were disfigured with frayed and broken satin slippers trodden\\ndown at heel, she really seemed to have no article of dress upon her,\\nfrom a pin upwards, that was in its proper condition or its right\\nplace.\\n\\n\"You find me, my dears,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, snuffing the two great\\noffice candles in tin candlesticks, which made the room taste\\nstrongly of hot tallow (the fire had gone out, and there was nothing\\nin the grate but ashes, a bundle of wood, and a poker), \"you find me,\\nmy dears, as usual, very busy; but that you will excuse. The African\\nproject at present employs my whole time. It involves me in\\ncorrespondence with public bodies and with private individuals\\nanxious for the welfare of their species all over the country. I am\\nhappy to say it is advancing. We hope by this time next year to have\\nfrom a hundred and fifty to two hundred healthy families cultivating\\ncoffee and educating the natives of Borrioboola-Gha, on the left bank\\nof the Niger.\"\\n\\nAs Ada said nothing, but looked at me, I said it must be very\\ngratifying.\\n\\n\"It IS gratifying,\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"It involves the devotion of\\nall my energies, such as they are; but that is nothing, so that it\\nsucceeds; and I am more confident of success every day. Do you know,\\nMiss Summerson, I almost wonder that YOU never turned your thoughts\\nto Africa.\"\\n\\nThis application of the subject was really so unexpected to me that I\\nwas quite at a loss how to receive it. I hinted that the climate--\\n\\n\"The finest climate in the world!\" said Mrs. Jellyby.\\n\\n\"Indeed, ma\\'am?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. With precaution,\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"You may go into\\nHolborn, without precaution, and be run over. You may go into\\nHolborn, with precaution, and never be run over. Just so with\\nAfrica.\"\\n\\nI said, \"No doubt.\" I meant as to Holborn.\\n\\n\"If you would like,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, putting a number of papers\\ntowards us, \"to look over some remarks on that head, and on the\\ngeneral subject, which have been extensively circulated, while I\\nfinish a letter I am now dictating to my eldest daughter, who is my\\namanuensis--\"\\n\\nThe girl at the table left off biting her pen and made a return to\\nour recognition, which was half bashful and half sulky.\\n\\n\"--I shall then have finished for the present,\" proceeded Mrs.\\nJellyby with a sweet smile, \"though my work is never done. Where are\\nyou, Caddy?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Presents her compliments to Mr. Swallow, and begs--\\'\" said Caddy.\\n\\n\"\\'And begs,\\'\" said Mrs. Jellyby, dictating, \"\\'to inform him, in\\nreference to his letter of inquiry on the African project--\\' No,\\nPeepy! Not on my account!\"\\n\\nPeepy (so self-named) was the unfortunate child who had fallen\\ndownstairs, who now interrupted the correspondence by presenting\\nhimself, with a strip of plaster on his forehead, to exhibit his\\nwounded knees, in which Ada and I did not know which to pity\\nmost--the bruises or the dirt. Mrs. Jellyby merely added, with the\\nserene composure with which she said everything, \"Go along, you\\nnaughty Peepy!\" and fixed her fine eyes on Africa again.\\n\\nHowever, as she at once proceeded with her dictation, and as I\\ninterrupted nothing by doing it, I ventured quietly to stop poor\\nPeepy as he was going out and to take him up to nurse. He looked very\\nmuch astonished at it and at Ada\\'s kissing him, but soon fell fast\\nasleep in my arms, sobbing at longer and longer intervals, until he\\nwas quiet. I was so occupied with Peepy that I lost the letter in\\ndetail, though I derived such a general impression from it of the\\nmomentous importance of Africa, and the utter insignificance of all\\nother places and things, that I felt quite ashamed to have thought so\\nlittle about it.\\n\\n\"Six o\\'clock!\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"And our dinner hour is nominally\\n(for we dine at all hours) five! Caddy, show Miss Clare and Miss\\nSummerson their rooms. You will like to make some change, perhaps?\\nYou will excuse me, I know, being so much occupied. Oh, that very bad\\nchild! Pray put him down, Miss Summerson!\"\\n\\nI begged permission to retain him, truly saying that he was not at\\nall troublesome, and carried him upstairs and laid him on my bed. Ada\\nand I had two upper rooms with a door of communication between. They\\nwere excessively bare and disorderly, and the curtain to my window\\nwas fastened up with a fork.\\n\\n\"You would like some hot water, wouldn\\'t you?\" said Miss Jellyby,\\nlooking round for a jug with a handle to it, but looking in vain.\\n\\n\"If it is not being troublesome,\" said we.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s not the trouble,\" returned Miss Jellyby; \"the question is,\\nif there IS any.\"\\n\\nThe evening was so very cold and the rooms had such a marshy smell\\nthat I must confess it was a little miserable, and Ada was half\\ncrying. We soon laughed, however, and were busily unpacking when Miss\\nJellyby came back to say that she was sorry there was no hot water,\\nbut they couldn\\'t find the kettle, and the boiler was out of order.\\n\\nWe begged her not to mention it and made all the haste we could to\\nget down to the fire again. But all the little children had come up\\nto the landing outside to look at the phenomenon of Peepy lying on my\\nbed, and our attention was distracted by the constant apparition of\\nnoses and fingers in situations of danger between the hinges of the\\ndoors. It was impossible to shut the door of either room, for my\\nlock, with no knob to it, looked as if it wanted to be wound up; and\\nthough the handle of Ada\\'s went round and round with the greatest\\nsmoothness, it was attended with no effect whatever on the door.\\nTherefore I proposed to the children that they should come in and be\\nvery good at my table, and I would tell them the story of Little Red\\nRiding Hood while I dressed; which they did, and were as quiet as\\nmice, including Peepy, who awoke opportunely before the appearance of\\nthe wolf.\\n\\nWhen we went downstairs we found a mug with \"A Present from Tunbridge\\nWells\" on it lighted up in the staircase window with a floating wick,\\nand a young woman, with a swelled face bound up in a flannel bandage\\nblowing the fire of the drawing-room (now connected by an open door\\nwith Mrs. Jellyby\\'s room) and choking dreadfully. It smoked to that\\ndegree, in short, that we all sat coughing and crying with the\\nwindows open for half an hour, during which Mrs. Jellyby, with the\\nsame sweetness of temper, directed letters about Africa. Her being so\\nemployed was, I must say, a great relief to me, for Richard told us\\nthat he had washed his hands in a pie-dish and that they had found\\nthe kettle on his dressing-table, and he made Ada laugh so that they\\nmade me laugh in the most ridiculous manner.\\n\\nSoon after seven o\\'clock we went down to dinner, carefully, by Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s advice, for the stair-carpets, besides being very deficient\\nin stair-wires, were so torn as to be absolute traps. We had a fine\\ncod-fish, a piece of roast beef, a dish of cutlets, and a pudding; an\\nexcellent dinner, if it had had any cooking to speak of, but it was\\nalmost raw. The young woman with the flannel bandage waited, and\\ndropped everything on the table wherever it happened to go, and never\\nmoved it again until she put it on the stairs. The person I had seen\\nin pattens, who I suppose to have been the cook, frequently came and\\nskirmished with her at the door, and there appeared to be ill will\\nbetween them.\\n\\nAll through dinner--which was long, in consequence of such accidents\\nas the dish of potatoes being mislaid in the coal skuttle and the\\nhandle of the corkscrew coming off and striking the young woman in\\nthe chin--Mrs. Jellyby preserved the evenness of her disposition. She\\ntold us a great deal that was interesting about Borrioboola-Gha and\\nthe natives, and received so many letters that Richard, who sat by\\nher, saw four envelopes in the gravy at once. Some of the letters\\nwere proceedings of ladies\\' committees or resolutions of ladies\\'\\nmeetings, which she read to us; others were applications from people\\nexcited in various ways about the cultivation of coffee, and natives;\\nothers required answers, and these she sent her eldest daughter from\\nthe table three or four times to write. She was full of business and\\nundoubtedly was, as she had told us, devoted to the cause.\\n\\nI was a little curious to know who a mild bald gentleman in\\nspectacles was, who dropped into a vacant chair (there was no top or\\nbottom in particular) after the fish was taken away and seemed\\npassively to submit himself to Borrioboola-Gha but not to be actively\\ninterested in that settlement. As he never spoke a word, he might\\nhave been a native but for his complexion. It was not until we left\\nthe table and he remained alone with Richard that the possibility of\\nhis being Mr. Jellyby ever entered my head. But he WAS Mr. Jellyby;\\nand a loquacious young man called Mr. Quale, with large shining knobs\\nfor temples and his hair all brushed to the back of his head, who\\ncame in the evening, and told Ada he was a philanthropist, also\\ninformed her that he called the matrimonial alliance of Mrs. Jellyby\\nwith Mr. Jellyby the union of mind and matter.\\n\\nThis young man, besides having a great deal to say for himself about\\nAfrica and a project of his for teaching the coffee colonists to\\nteach the natives to turn piano-forte legs and establish an export\\ntrade, delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby out by saying, \"I believe\\nnow, Mrs. Jellyby, you have received as many as from one hundred and\\nfifty to two hundred letters respecting Africa in a single day, have\\nyou not?\" or, \"If my memory does not deceive me, Mrs. Jellyby, you\\nonce mentioned that you had sent off five thousand circulars from one\\npost-office at one time?\"--always repeating Mrs. Jellyby\\'s answer to\\nus like an interpreter. During the whole evening, Mr. Jellyby sat in\\na corner with his head against the wall as if he were subject to low\\nspirits. It seemed that he had several times opened his mouth when\\nalone with Richard after dinner, as if he had something on his mind,\\nbut had always shut it again, to Richard\\'s extreme confusion, without\\nsaying anything.\\n\\nMrs. Jellyby, sitting in quite a nest of waste paper, drank coffee\\nall the evening and dictated at intervals to her eldest daughter. She\\nalso held a discussion with Mr. Quale, of which the subject seemed to\\nbe--if I understood it--the brotherhood of humanity, and gave\\nutterance to some beautiful sentiments. I was not so attentive an\\nauditor as I might have wished to be, however, for Peepy and the\\nother children came flocking about Ada and me in a corner of the\\ndrawing-room to ask for another story; so we sat down among them and\\ntold them in whispers \"Puss in Boots\" and I don\\'t know what else\\nuntil Mrs. Jellyby, accidentally remembering them, sent them to bed.\\nAs Peepy cried for me to take him to bed, I carried him upstairs,\\nwhere the young woman with the flannel bandage charged into the midst\\nof the little family like a dragon and overturned them into cribs.\\n\\nAfter that I occupied myself in making our room a little tidy and in\\ncoaxing a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn, which at\\nlast it did, quite brightly. On my return downstairs, I felt that\\nMrs. Jellyby looked down upon me rather for being so frivolous, and I\\nwas sorry for it, though at the same time I knew that I had no higher\\npretensions.\\n\\nIt was nearly midnight before we found an opportunity of going to\\nbed, and even then we left Mrs. Jellyby among her papers drinking\\ncoffee and Miss Jellyby biting the feather of her pen.\\n\\n\"What a strange house!\" said Ada when we got upstairs. \"How curious\\nof my cousin Jarndyce to send us here!\"\\n\\n\"My love,\" said I, \"it quite confuses me. I want to understand it,\\nand I can\\'t understand it at all.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" asked Ada with her pretty smile.\\n\\n\"All this, my dear,\" said I. \"It MUST be very good of Mrs. Jellyby to\\ntake such pains about a scheme for the benefit of natives--and\\nyet--Peepy and the housekeeping!\"\\n\\nAda laughed and put her arm about my neck as I stood looking at the\\nfire, and told me I was a quiet, dear, good creature and had won her\\nheart. \"You are so thoughtful, Esther,\" she said, \"and yet so\\ncheerful! And you do so much, so unpretendingly! You would make a\\nhome out of even this house.\"\\n\\nMy simple darling! She was quite unconscious that she only praised\\nherself and that it was in the goodness of her own heart that she\\nmade so much of me!\\n\\n\"May I ask you a question?\" said I when we had sat before the fire a\\nlittle while.\\n\\n\"Five hundred,\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"Your cousin, Mr. Jarndyce. I owe so much to him. Would you mind\\ndescribing him to me?\"\\n\\nShaking her golden hair, Ada turned her eyes upon me with such\\nlaughing wonder that I was full of wonder too, partly at her beauty,\\npartly at her surprise.\\n\\n\"Esther!\" she cried.\\n\\n\"My dear!\"\\n\\n\"You want a description of my cousin Jarndyce?\"\\n\\n\"My dear, I never saw him.\"\\n\\n\"And I never saw him!\" returned Ada.\\n\\nWell, to be sure!\\n\\nNo, she had never seen him. Young as she was when her mama died, she\\nremembered how the tears would come into her eyes when she spoke of\\nhim and of the noble generosity of his character, which she had said\\nwas to be trusted above all earthly things; and Ada trusted it. Her\\ncousin Jarndyce had written to her a few months ago--\"a plain, honest\\nletter,\" Ada said--proposing the arrangement we were now to enter on\\nand telling her that \"in time it might heal some of the wounds made\\nby the miserable Chancery suit.\" She had replied, gratefully\\naccepting his proposal. Richard had received a similar letter and had\\nmade a similar response. He HAD seen Mr. Jarndyce once, but only\\nonce, five years ago, at Winchester school. He had told Ada, when\\nthey were leaning on the screen before the fire where I found them,\\nthat he recollected him as \"a bluff, rosy fellow.\" This was the\\nutmost description Ada could give me.\\n\\nIt set me thinking so that when Ada was asleep, I still remained\\nbefore the fire, wondering and wondering about Bleak House, and\\nwondering and wondering that yesterday morning should seem so long\\nago. I don\\'t know where my thoughts had wandered when they were\\nrecalled by a tap at the door.\\n\\nI opened it softly and found Miss Jellyby shivering there with a\\nbroken candle in a broken candlestick in one hand and an egg-cup in\\nthe other.\\n\\n\"Good night!\" she said very sulkily.\\n\\n\"Good night!\" said I.\\n\\n\"May I come in?\" she shortly and unexpectedly asked me in the same\\nsulky way.\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said I. \"Don\\'t wake Miss Clare.\"\\n\\nShe would not sit down, but stood by the fire dipping her inky middle\\nfinger in the egg-cup, which contained vinegar, and smearing it over\\nthe ink stains on her face, frowning the whole time and looking very\\ngloomy.\\n\\n\"I wish Africa was dead!\" she said on a sudden.\\n\\nI was going to remonstrate.\\n\\n\"I do!\" she said \"Don\\'t talk to me, Miss Summerson. I hate it and\\ndetest it. It\\'s a beast!\"\\n\\nI told her she was tired, and I was sorry. I put my hand upon her\\nhead, and touched her forehead, and said it was hot now but would be\\ncool to-morrow. She still stood pouting and frowning at me, but\\npresently put down her egg-cup and turned softly towards the bed\\nwhere Ada lay.\\n\\n\"She is very pretty!\" she said with the same knitted brow and in the\\nsame uncivil manner.\\n\\nI assented with a smile.\\n\\n\"An orphan. Ain\\'t she?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"But knows a quantity, I suppose? Can dance, and play music, and\\nsing? She can talk French, I suppose, and do geography, and globes,\\nand needlework, and everything?\"\\n\\n\"No doubt,\" said I.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t,\" she returned. \"I can\\'t do anything hardly, except write.\\nI\\'m always writing for Ma. I wonder you two were not ashamed of\\nyourselves to come in this afternoon and see me able to do nothing\\nelse. It was like your ill nature. Yet you think yourselves very\\nfine, I dare say!\"\\n\\nI could see that the poor girl was near crying, and I resumed my\\nchair without speaking and looked at her (I hope) as mildly as I felt\\ntowards her.\\n\\n\"It\\'s disgraceful,\" she said. \"You know it is. The whole house is\\ndisgraceful. The children are disgraceful. I\\'M disgraceful. Pa\\'s\\nmiserable, and no wonder! Priscilla drinks--she\\'s always drinking.\\nIt\\'s a great shame and a great story of you if you say you didn\\'t\\nsmell her to-day. It was as bad as a public-house, waiting at dinner;\\nyou know it was!\"\\n\\n\"My dear, I don\\'t know it,\" said I.\\n\\n\"You do,\" she said very shortly. \"You shan\\'t say you don\\'t. You do!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear!\" said I. \"If you won\\'t let me speak--\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re speaking now. You know you are. Don\\'t tell stories, Miss\\nSummerson.\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" said I, \"as long as you won\\'t hear me out--\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to hear you out.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I think you do,\" said I, \"because that would be so very\\nunreasonable. I did not know what you tell me because the servant did\\nnot come near me at dinner; but I don\\'t doubt what you tell me, and I\\nam sorry to hear it.\"\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t make a merit of that,\" said she.\\n\\n\"No, my dear,\" said I. \"That would be very foolish.\"\\n\\nShe was still standing by the bed, and now stooped down (but still\\nwith the same discontented face) and kissed Ada. That done, she came\\nsoftly back and stood by the side of my chair. Her bosom was heaving\\nin a distressful manner that I greatly pitied, but I thought it\\nbetter not to speak.\\n\\n\"I wish I was dead!\" she broke out. \"I wish we were all dead. It\\nwould be a great deal better for us.\"\\n\\nIn a moment afterwards, she knelt on the ground at my side, hid her\\nface in my dress, passionately begged my pardon, and wept. I\\ncomforted her and would have raised her, but she cried no, no; she\\nwanted to stay there!\\n\\n\"You used to teach girls,\" she said, \"If you could only have taught\\nme, I could have learnt from you! I am so very miserable, and I like\\nyou so much!\"\\n\\nI could not persuade her to sit by me or to do anything but move a\\nragged stool to where she was kneeling, and take that, and still hold\\nmy dress in the same manner. By degrees the poor tired girl fell\\nasleep, and then I contrived to raise her head so that it should rest\\non my lap, and to cover us both with shawls. The fire went out, and\\nall night long she slumbered thus before the ashy grate. At first I\\nwas painfully awake and vainly tried to lose myself, with my eyes\\nclosed, among the scenes of the day. At length, by slow degrees, they\\nbecame indistinct and mingled. I began to lose the identity of the\\nsleeper resting on me. Now it was Ada, now one of my old Reading\\nfriends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted. Now\\nit was the little mad woman worn out with curtsying and smiling, now\\nsome one in authority at Bleak House. Lastly, it was no one, and I\\nwas no one.\\n\\nThe purblind day was feebly struggling with the fog when I opened my\\neyes to encounter those of a dirty-faced little spectre fixed upon\\nme. Peepy had scaled his crib, and crept down in his bed-gown and\\ncap, and was so cold that his teeth were chattering as if he had cut\\nthem all.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'model_output': \" The text describes the experiences of a young woman named Esther Summerson as she travels to London and begins working for her guardian, Mr. Jarndyce.

      "[{'summary': 'Tulkinghorn and Krook find Nemo dead, apparently from an overdose of opium. Krook claims no knowledge of Mr. Nemo\\'s identity or habits, and is chagrined because Nemo owes him six weeks\\' rent. Dr. Woodcourt (though he is not named immediately) arrives on the scene and reveals that Nemo has bought opium from him for a year and a half. Tulkinghorn learns from the ragamuffin Jo, a crossing-sweeper, that Nemo was a kind man, and gave Jo money when he had it. \"He wos wery good to me, he wos!\"\\n\\nAn inquest is held regarding Nemo\\'s death, a silly proceeding in a tavern complete with a comic vocalist, and he is officially found dead by accident. Since Nemo had no money or family, he is buried in a pauper\\'s grave.\\n\\nIn Chapter 12, the scene returns to Chesney Wold. The Dedlocks have returned, and have guests. Meanwhile Lady Dedlock continues to suffer ennui. Lady Dedlock meets the young maid Rosa for the first time, and takes a liking to her. This causes jealousy to arise in Lady Dedlock\\'s personal lady\\'s maid, Mademoiselle Hortense.\\n\\nTulkinghorn comes to Chesney Wold to inform Sir Leicester of the lawsuit brought upon him by his neighbor Boythorn. Tulkinghorn also has a message for Lady Dedlock concerning Nemo, whose handwriting was on the paper she had such interest in the last time he was at Chesney Wold, and tells of the law writer\\'s death. She pretends that the death doesn\\'t especially concern her; Tulkinghorn, unfooled, sees otherwise. The rest of the visit Lady Dedlock and Tulkinghorn watch each other carefully and surreptitiously.\\n\\nIn Chapter 13 Richard\\'s future is under futher discussion. His education has been soley the Classics (meaning, in those days, ancient Latin and Greek literature). Richard knows nothing about what he would like to do, except that he doesn\\'t want to become a minister in the Church of England. Mr. Jarndyce suggest the medical profession, and Richard quickly (too quickly) seizes upon the idea.\\n\\nMr. Boythorn -- along with Mr. Kenge, who is also present -- is enthusiastic about Richard\\'s proposed medical career and propounds the maltreatment of doctors aboard Navy ships. The men discuss how Richard is to be gotten into the profession, and Mr. Kenge plans for his cousin, Dr. Bayham Badger, to take Richard as an apprentice.\\n\\nAs Mr. Badger lives in London, the party goes to London a few weeks later to get Richard settled. In London, Esther attends the theatre and is followed and stared at by the lovestruck Mr. Guppy. Ada and Richard\\'s romance continues to blossom.\\n\\nAt Mr. Badger\\'s house the party meets Dr. Allan Woodcourt, and Esther finds him attractive. The talk at the Badgers\\' is of an unconventional kind -- namely the wealth and prestige of Mrs. Badgers two deceased husbands. Esther tells Mr. Jarndyce that Ada and Richard are in love, but he advises the lovers that because they are too young, and because Richard is not yet established, they should wait to be married. ', 'text': 'A touch on the lawyer\\'s wrinkled hand as he stands in the dark room,\\nirresolute, makes him start and say, \"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s me,\" returns the old man of the house, whose breath is in his\\near. \"Can\\'t you wake him?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"What have you done with your candle?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s gone out. Here it is.\"\\n\\nKrook takes it, goes to the fire, stoops over the red embers, and\\ntries to get a light. The dying ashes have no light to spare, and his\\nendeavours are vain. Muttering, after an ineffectual call to his\\nlodger, that he will go downstairs and bring a lighted candle from\\nthe shop, the old man departs. Mr. Tulkinghorn, for some new reason\\nthat he has, does not await his return in the room, but on the stairs\\noutside.\\n\\nThe welcome light soon shines upon the wall, as Krook comes slowly up\\nwith his green-eyed cat following at his heels. \"Does the man\\ngenerally sleep like this?\" inquired the lawyer in a low voice. \"Hi!\\nI don\\'t know,\" says Krook, shaking his head and lifting his eyebrows.\\n\"I know next to nothing of his habits except that he keeps himself\\nvery close.\"\\n\\nThus whispering, they both go in together. As the light goes in, the\\ngreat eyes in the shutters, darkening, seem to close. Not so the eyes\\nupon the bed.\\n\\n\"God save us!\" exclaims Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"He is dead!\" Krook drops\\nthe heavy hand he has taken up so suddenly that the arm swings over\\nthe bedside.\\n\\nThey look at one another for a moment.\\n\\n\"Send for some doctor! Call for Miss Flite up the stairs, sir. Here\\'s\\npoison by the bed! Call out for Flite, will you?\" says Krook, with\\nhis lean hands spread out above the body like a vampire\\'s wings.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn hurries to the landing and calls, \"Miss Flite! Flite!\\nMake haste, here, whoever you are! Flite!\" Krook follows him with his\\neyes, and while he is calling, finds opportunity to steal to the old\\nportmanteau and steal back again.\\n\\n\"Run, Flite, run! The nearest doctor! Run!\" So Mr. Krook addresses a\\ncrazy little woman who is his female lodger, who appears and vanishes\\nin a breath, who soon returns accompanied by a testy medical man\\nbrought from his dinner, with a broad, snuffy upper lip and a broad\\nScotch tongue.\\n\\n\"Ey! Bless the hearts o\\' ye,\" says the medical man, looking up at\\nthem after a moment\\'s examination. \"He\\'s just as dead as Phairy!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn (standing by the old portmanteau) inquires if he has\\nbeen dead any time.\\n\\n\"Any time, sir?\" says the medical gentleman. \"It\\'s probable he wull\\nhave been dead aboot three hours.\"\\n\\n\"About that time, I should say,\" observes a dark young man on the\\nother side of the bed.\\n\\n\"Air you in the maydickle prayfession yourself, sir?\" inquires the\\nfirst.\\n\\nThe dark young man says yes.\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll just tak\\' my depairture,\" replies the other, \"for I\\'m nae\\ngude here!\" With which remark he finishes his brief attendance and\\nreturns to finish his dinner.\\n\\nThe dark young surgeon passes the candle across and across the face\\nand carefully examines the law-writer, who has established his\\npretensions to his name by becoming indeed No one.\\n\\n\"I knew this person by sight very well,\" says he. \"He has purchased\\nopium of me for the last year and a half. Was anybody present related\\nto him?\" glancing round upon the three bystanders.\\n\\n\"I was his landlord,\" grimly answers Krook, taking the candle from\\nthe surgeon\\'s outstretched hand. \"He told me once I was the nearest\\nrelation he had.\"\\n\\n\"He has died,\" says the surgeon, \"of an over-dose of opium, there is\\nno doubt. The room is strongly flavoured with it. There is enough\\nhere now,\" taking an old tea-pot from Mr. Krook, \"to kill a dozen\\npeople.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think he did it on purpose?\" asks Krook.\\n\\n\"Took the over-dose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes!\" Krook almost smacks his lips with the unction of a horrible\\ninterest.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t say. I should think it unlikely, as he has been in the habit\\nof taking so much. But nobody can tell. He was very poor, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"I suppose he was. His room--don\\'t look rich,\" says Krook, who might\\nhave changed eyes with his cat, as he casts his sharp glance around.\\n\"But I have never been in it since he had it, and he was too close to\\nname his circumstances to me.\"\\n\\n\"Did he owe you any rent?\"\\n\\n\"Six weeks.\"\\n\\n\"He will never pay it!\" says the young man, resuming his examination.\\n\"It is beyond a doubt that he is indeed as dead as Pharaoh; and to\\njudge from his appearance and condition, I should think it a happy\\nrelease. Yet he must have been a good figure when a youth, and I dare\\nsay, good-looking.\" He says this, not unfeelingly, while sitting on\\nthe bedstead\\'s edge with his face towards that other face and his\\nhand upon the region of the heart. \"I recollect once thinking there\\nwas something in his manner, uncouth as it was, that denoted a fall\\nin life. Was that so?\" he continues, looking round.\\n\\nKrook replies, \"You might as well ask me to describe the ladies whose\\nheads of hair I have got in sacks downstairs. Than that he was my\\nlodger for a year and a half and lived--or didn\\'t live--by\\nlaw-writing, I know no more of him.\"\\n\\nDuring this dialogue Mr. Tulkinghorn has stood aloof by the old\\nportmanteau, with his hands behind him, equally removed, to all\\nappearance, from all three kinds of interest exhibited near the\\nbed--from the young surgeon\\'s professional interest in death,\\nnoticeable as being quite apart from his remarks on the deceased as\\nan individual; from the old man\\'s unction; and the little crazy\\nwoman\\'s awe. His imperturbable face has been as inexpressive as his\\nrusty clothes. One could not even say he has been thinking all this\\nwhile. He has shown neither patience nor impatience, nor attention\\nnor abstraction. He has shown nothing but his shell. As easily might\\nthe tone of a delicate musical instrument be inferred from its case,\\nas the tone of Mr. Tulkinghorn from his case.\\n\\nHe now interposes, addressing the young surgeon in his unmoved,\\nprofessional way.\\n\\n\"I looked in here,\" he observes, \"just before you, with the\\nintention of giving this deceased man, whom I never saw alive, some\\nemployment at his trade of copying. I had heard of him from my\\nstationer--Snagsby of Cook\\'s Court. Since no one here knows anything\\nabout him, it might be as well to send for Snagsby. Ah!\" to the\\nlittle crazy woman, who has often seen him in court, and whom he has\\noften seen, and who proposes, in frightened dumb-show, to go for the\\nlaw-stationer. \"Suppose you do!\"\\n\\nWhile she is gone, the surgeon abandons his hopeless investigation\\nand covers its subject with the patchwork counterpane. Mr. Krook and\\nhe interchange a word or two. Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing, but\\nstands, ever, near the old portmanteau.\\n\\nMr. Snagsby arrives hastily in his grey coat and his black sleeves.\\n\"Dear me, dear me,\" he says; \"and it has come to this, has it! Bless\\nmy soul!\"\\n\\n\"Can you give the person of the house any information about this\\nunfortunate creature, Snagsby?\" inquires Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"He was in\\narrears with his rent, it seems. And he must be buried, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby, coughing his apologetic cough behind\\nhis hand, \"I really don\\'t know what advice I could offer, except\\nsending for the beadle.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t speak of advice,\" returns Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"I could\\nadvise--\"\\n\\n\"No one better, sir, I am sure,\" says Mr. Snagsby, with his\\ndeferential cough.\\n\\n\"I speak of affording some clue to his connexions, or to where he\\ncame from, or to anything concerning him.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby after prefacing his reply with\\nhis cough of general propitiation, \"that I no more know where he came\\nfrom than I know--\"\\n\\n\"Where he has gone to, perhaps,\" suggests the surgeon to help him\\nout.\\n\\nA pause. Mr. Tulkinghorn looking at the law-stationer. Mr. Krook,\\nwith his mouth open, looking for somebody to speak next.\\n\\n\"As to his connexions, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby, \"if a person was to\\nsay to me, \\'Snagsby, here\\'s twenty thousand pound down, ready for you\\nin the Bank of England if you\\'ll only name one of \\'em,\\' I couldn\\'t do\\nit, sir! About a year and a half ago--to the best of my belief, at\\nthe time when he first came to lodge at the present rag and bottle\\nshop--\"\\n\\n\"That was the time!\" says Krook with a nod.\\n\\n\"About a year and a half ago,\" says Mr. Snagsby, strengthened, \"he\\ncame into our place one morning after breakfast, and finding my\\nlittle woman (which I name Mrs. Snagsby when I use that appellation)\\nin our shop, produced a specimen of his handwriting and gave her to\\nunderstand that he was in want of copying work to do and was, not to\\nput too fine a point upon it,\" a favourite apology for plain speaking\\nwith Mr. Snagsby, which he always offers with a sort of argumentative\\nfrankness, \"hard up! My little woman is not in general partial to\\nstrangers, particular--not to put too fine a point upon it--when they\\nwant anything. But she was rather took by something about this\\nperson, whether by his being unshaved, or by his hair being in want\\nof attention, or by what other ladies\\' reasons, I leave you to judge;\\nand she accepted of the specimen, and likewise of the address. My\\nlittle woman hasn\\'t a good ear for names,\" proceeds Mr. Snagsby after\\nconsulting his cough of consideration behind his hand, \"and she\\nconsidered Nemo equally the same as Nimrod. In consequence of which,\\nshe got into a habit of saying to me at meals, \\'Mr. Snagsby, you\\nhaven\\'t found Nimrod any work yet!\\' or \\'Mr. Snagsby, why didn\\'t you\\ngive that eight and thirty Chancery folio in Jarndyce to Nimrod?\\' or\\nsuch like. And that is the way he gradually fell into job-work at our\\nplace; and that is the most I know of him except that he was a quick\\nhand, and a hand not sparing of night-work, and that if you gave him\\nout, say, five and forty folio on the Wednesday night, you would have\\nit brought in on the Thursday morning. All of which--\" Mr. Snagsby\\nconcludes by politely motioning with his hat towards the bed, as much\\nas to add, \"I have no doubt my honourable friend would confirm if he\\nwere in a condition to do it.\"\\n\\n\"Hadn\\'t you better see,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn to Krook, \"whether he\\nhad any papers that may enlighten you? There will be an inquest, and\\nyou will be asked the question. You can read?\"\\n\\n\"No, I can\\'t,\" returns the old man with a sudden grin.\\n\\n\"Snagsby,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, \"look over the room for him. He will\\nget into some trouble or difficulty otherwise. Being here, I\\'ll wait\\nif you make haste, and then I can testify on his behalf, if it should\\never be necessary, that all was fair and right. If you will hold the\\ncandle for Mr. Snagsby, my friend, he\\'ll soon see whether there is\\nanything to help you.\"\\n\\n\"In the first place, here\\'s an old portmanteau, sir,\" says Snagsby.\\n\\nAh, to be sure, so there is! Mr. Tulkinghorn does not appear to have\\nseen it before, though he is standing so close to it, and though\\nthere is very little else, heaven knows.\\n\\nThe marine-store merchant holds the light, and the law-stationer\\nconducts the search. The surgeon leans against the corner of the\\nchimney-piece; Miss Flite peeps and trembles just within the door.\\nThe apt old scholar of the old school, with his dull black breeches\\ntied with ribbons at the knees, his large black waistcoat, his\\nlong-sleeved black coat, and his wisp of limp white neckerchief tied\\nin the bow the peerage knows so well, stands in exactly the same\\nplace and attitude.\\n\\nThere are some worthless articles of clothing in the old portmanteau;\\nthere is a bundle of pawnbrokers\\' duplicates, those turnpike tickets\\non the road of poverty; there is a crumpled paper, smelling of opium,\\non which are scrawled rough memoranda--as, took, such a day, so many\\ngrains; took, such another day, so many more--begun some time ago, as\\nif with the intention of being regularly continued, but soon left\\noff. There are a few dirty scraps of newspapers, all referring to\\ncoroners\\' inquests; there is nothing else. They search the cupboard\\nand the drawer of the ink-splashed table. There is not a morsel of an\\nold letter or of any other writing in either. The young surgeon\\nexamines the dress on the law-writer. A knife and some odd halfpence\\nare all he finds. Mr. Snagsby\\'s suggestion is the practical\\nsuggestion after all, and the beadle must be called in.\\n\\nSo the little crazy lodger goes for the beadle, and the rest come out\\nof the room. \"Don\\'t leave the cat there!\" says the surgeon; \"that\\nwon\\'t do!\" Mr. Krook therefore drives her out before him, and she\\ngoes furtively downstairs, winding her lithe tail and licking her\\nlips.\\n\\n\"Good night!\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, and goes home to Allegory and\\nmeditation.\\n\\nBy this time the news has got into the court. Groups of its\\ninhabitants assemble to discuss the thing, and the outposts of the\\narmy of observation (principally boys) are pushed forward to Mr.\\nKrook\\'s window, which they closely invest. A policeman has already\\nwalked up to the room, and walked down again to the door, where he\\nstands like a tower, only condescending to see the boys at his base\\noccasionally; but whenever he does see them, they quail and fall\\nback. Mrs. Perkins, who has not been for some weeks on speaking terms\\nwith Mrs. Piper in consequence for an unpleasantness originating in\\nyoung Perkins\\' having \"fetched\" young Piper \"a crack,\" renews her\\nfriendly intercourse on this auspicious occasion. The potboy at the\\ncorner, who is a privileged amateur, as possessing official knowledge\\nof life and having to deal with drunken men occasionally, exchanges\\nconfidential communications with the policeman and has the appearance\\nof an impregnable youth, unassailable by truncheons and unconfinable\\nin station-houses. People talk across the court out of window, and\\nbare-headed scouts come hurrying in from Chancery Lane to know what\\'s\\nthe matter. The general feeling seems to be that it\\'s a blessing Mr.\\nKrook warn\\'t made away with first, mingled with a little natural\\ndisappointment that he was not. In the midst of this sensation, the\\nbeadle arrives.\\n\\nThe beadle, though generally understood in the neighbourhood to be a\\nridiculous institution, is not without a certain popularity for the\\nmoment, if it were only as a man who is going to see the body. The\\npoliceman considers him an imbecile civilian, a remnant of the\\nbarbarous watchmen times, but gives him admission as something that\\nmust be borne with until government shall abolish him. The sensation\\nis heightened as the tidings spread from mouth to mouth that the\\nbeadle is on the ground and has gone in.\\n\\nBy and by the beadle comes out, once more intensifying the sensation,\\nwhich has rather languished in the interval. He is understood to be\\nin want of witnesses for the inquest to-morrow who can tell the\\ncoroner and jury anything whatever respecting the deceased. Is\\nimmediately referred to innumerable people who can tell nothing\\nwhatever. Is made more imbecile by being constantly informed that\\nMrs. Green\\'s son \"was a law-writer his-self and knowed him better\\nthan anybody,\" which son of Mrs. Green\\'s appears, on inquiry, to be\\nat the present time aboard a vessel bound for China, three months\\nout, but considered accessible by telegraph on application to the\\nLords of the Admiralty. Beadle goes into various shops and parlours,\\nexamining the inhabitants, always shutting the door first, and by\\nexclusion, delay, and general idiotcy exasperating the public.\\nPoliceman seen to smile to potboy. Public loses interest and\\nundergoes reaction. Taunts the beadle in shrill youthful voices with\\nhaving boiled a boy, choruses fragments of a popular song to that\\neffect and importing that the boy was made into soup for the\\nworkhouse. Policeman at last finds it necessary to support the law\\nand seize a vocalist, who is released upon the flight of the rest on\\ncondition of his getting out of this then, come, and cutting it--a\\ncondition he immediately observes. So the sensation dies off for the\\ntime; and the unmoved policeman (to whom a little opium, more or\\nless, is nothing), with his shining hat, stiff stock, inflexible\\ngreat-coat, stout belt and bracelet, and all things fitting, pursues\\nhis lounging way with a heavy tread, beating the palms of his white\\ngloves one against the other and stopping now and then at a\\nstreet-corner to look casually about for anything between a lost\\nchild and a murder.\\n\\nUnder cover of the night, the feeble-minded beadle comes flitting\\nabout Chancery Lane with his summonses, in which every juror\\'s name\\nis wrongly spelt, and nothing rightly spelt but the beadle\\'s own\\nname, which nobody can read or wants to know. The summonses served\\nand his witnesses forewarned, the beadle goes to Mr. Krook\\'s to keep\\na small appointment he has made with certain paupers, who, presently\\narriving, are conducted upstairs, where they leave the great eyes in\\nthe shutter something new to stare at, in that last shape which\\nearthly lodgings take for No one--and for Every one.\\n\\nAnd all that night the coffin stands ready by the old portmanteau;\\nand the lonely figure on the bed, whose path in life has lain through\\nfive and forty years, lies there with no more track behind him that\\nany one can trace than a deserted infant.\\n\\nNext day the court is all alive--is like a fair, as Mrs. Perkins,\\nmore than reconciled to Mrs. Piper, says in amicable conversation\\nwith that excellent woman. The coroner is to sit in the first-floor\\nroom at the Sol\\'s Arms, where the Harmonic Meetings take place twice\\na week and where the chair is filled by a gentleman of professional\\ncelebrity, faced by Little Swills, the comic vocalist, who hopes\\n(according to the bill in the window) that his friends will rally\\nround him and support first-rate talent. The Sol\\'s Arms does a brisk\\nstroke of business all the morning. Even children so require\\nsustaining under the general excitement that a pieman who has\\nestablished himself for the occasion at the corner of the court says\\nhis brandy-balls go off like smoke. What time the beadle, hovering\\nbetween the door of Mr. Krook\\'s establishment and the door of the\\nSol\\'s Arms, shows the curiosity in his keeping to a few discreet\\nspirits and accepts the compliment of a glass of ale or so in return.\\n\\nAt the appointed hour arrives the coroner, for whom the jurymen are\\nwaiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good\\ndry skittle-ground attached to the Sol\\'s Arms. The coroner frequents\\nmore public-houses than any man alive. The smell of sawdust, beer,\\ntobacco-smoke, and spirits is inseparable in his vocation from death\\nin its most awful shapes. He is conducted by the beadle and the\\nlandlord to the Harmonic Meeting Room, where he puts his hat on the\\npiano and takes a Windsor-chair at the head of a long table formed of\\nseveral short tables put together and ornamented with glutinous rings\\nin endless involutions, made by pots and glasses. As many of the jury\\nas can crowd together at the table sit there. The rest get among the\\nspittoons and pipes or lean against the piano. Over the coroner\\'s\\nhead is a small iron garland, the pendant handle of a bell, which\\nrather gives the majesty of the court the appearance of going to be\\nhanged presently.\\n\\nCall over and swear the jury! While the ceremony is in progress,\\nsensation is created by the entrance of a chubby little man in a\\nlarge shirt-collar, with a moist eye and an inflamed nose, who\\nmodestly takes a position near the door as one of the general public,\\nbut seems familiar with the room too. A whisper circulates that this\\nis Little Swills. It is considered not unlikely that he will get up\\nan imitation of the coroner and make it the principal feature of the\\nHarmonic Meeting in the evening.\\n\\n\"Well, gentlemen--\" the coroner begins.\\n\\n\"Silence there, will you!\" says the beadle. Not to the coroner,\\nthough it might appear so.\\n\\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" resumes the coroner. \"You are impanelled here to\\ninquire into the death of a certain man. Evidence will be given\\nbefore you as to the circumstances attending that death, and you will\\ngive your verdict according to the--skittles; they must be stopped,\\nyou know, beadle!--evidence, and not according to anything else. The\\nfirst thing to be done is to view the body.\"\\n\\n\"Make way there!\" cries the beadle.\\n\\nSo they go out in a loose procession, something after the manner of a\\nstraggling funeral, and make their inspection in Mr. Krook\\'s back\\nsecond floor, from which a few of the jurymen retire pale and\\nprecipitately. The beadle is very careful that two gentlemen not very\\nneat about the cuffs and buttons (for whose accommodation he has\\nprovided a special little table near the coroner in the Harmonic\\nMeeting Room) should see all that is to be seen. For they are the\\npublic chroniclers of such inquiries by the line; and he is not\\nsuperior to the universal human infirmity, but hopes to read in print\\nwhat \"Mooney, the active and intelligent beadle of the district,\"\\nsaid and did and even aspires to see the name of Mooney as familiarly\\nand patronizingly mentioned as the name of the hangman is, according\\nto the latest examples.\\n\\nLittle Swills is waiting for the coroner and jury on their return.\\nMr. Tulkinghorn, also. Mr. Tulkinghorn is received with distinction\\nand seated near the coroner between that high judicial officer, a\\nbagatelle-board, and the coal-box. The inquiry proceeds. The jury\\nlearn how the subject of their inquiry died, and learn no more about\\nhim. \"A very eminent solicitor is in attendance, gentlemen,\" says the\\ncoroner, \"who, I am informed, was accidentally present when discovery\\nof the death was made, but he could only repeat the evidence you have\\nalready heard from the surgeon, the landlord, the lodger, and the\\nlaw-stationer, and it is not necessary to trouble him. Is anybody in\\nattendance who knows anything more?\"\\n\\nMrs. Piper pushed forward by Mrs. Perkins. Mrs. Piper sworn.\\n\\nAnastasia Piper, gentlemen. Married woman. Now, Mrs. Piper, what have\\nyou got to say about this?\\n\\nWhy, Mrs. Piper has a good deal to say, chiefly in parentheses and\\nwithout punctuation, but not much to tell. Mrs. Piper lives in the\\ncourt (which her husband is a cabinet-maker), and it has long been\\nwell beknown among the neighbours (counting from the day next but one\\nbefore the half-baptizing of Alexander James Piper aged eighteen\\nmonths and four days old on accounts of not being expected to live\\nsuch was the sufferings gentlemen of that child in his gums) as the\\nplaintive--so Mrs. Piper insists on calling the deceased--was\\nreported to have sold himself. Thinks it was the plaintive\\'s air in\\nwhich that report originatinin. See the plaintive often and\\nconsidered as his air was feariocious and not to be allowed to go\\nabout some children being timid (and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins\\nmay be brought forard for she is here and will do credit to her\\nhusband and herself and family). Has seen the plaintive wexed and\\nworrited by the children (for children they will ever be and you\\ncannot expect them specially if of playful dispositions to be\\nMethoozellers which you was not yourself). On accounts of this and\\nhis dark looks has often dreamed as she see him take a pick-axe from\\nhis pocket and split Johnny\\'s head (which the child knows not fear\\nand has repeatually called after him close at his eels). Never\\nhowever see the plaintive take a pick-axe or any other wepping far\\nfrom it. Has seen him hurry away when run and called after as if not\\npartial to children and never see him speak to neither child nor\\ngrown person at any time (excepting the boy that sweeps the crossing\\ndown the lane over the way round the corner which if he was here\\nwould tell you that he has been seen a-speaking to him frequent).\\n\\nSays the coroner, is that boy here? Says the beadle, no, sir, he is\\nnot here. Says the coroner, go and fetch him then. In the absence of\\nthe active and intelligent, the coroner converses with Mr.\\nTulkinghorn.\\n\\nOh! Here\\'s the boy, gentlemen!\\n\\nHere he is, very muddy, very hoarse, very ragged. Now, boy! But stop\\na minute. Caution. This boy must be put through a few preliminary\\npaces.\\n\\nName, Jo. Nothing else that he knows on. Don\\'t know that everybody\\nhas two names. Never heerd of sich a think. Don\\'t know that Jo is\\nshort for a longer name. Thinks it long enough for HIM. HE don\\'t find\\nno fault with it. Spell it? No. HE can\\'t spell it. No father, no\\nmother, no friends. Never been to school. What\\'s home? Knows a\\nbroom\\'s a broom, and knows it\\'s wicked to tell a lie. Don\\'t recollect\\nwho told him about the broom or about the lie, but knows both. Can\\'t\\nexactly say what\\'ll be done to him arter he\\'s dead if he tells a lie\\nto the gentlemen here, but believes it\\'ll be something wery bad to\\npunish him, and serve him right--and so he\\'ll tell the truth.\\n\\n\"This won\\'t do, gentlemen!\" says the coroner with a melancholy shake\\nof the head.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you think you can receive his evidence, sir?\" asks an\\nattentive juryman.\\n\\n\"Out of the question,\" says the coroner. \"You have heard the boy.\\n\\'Can\\'t exactly say\\' won\\'t do, you know. We can\\'t take THAT in a court\\nof justice, gentlemen. It\\'s terrible depravity. Put the boy aside.\"\\n\\nBoy put aside, to the great edification of the audience, especially\\nof Little Swills, the comic vocalist.\\n\\nNow. Is there any other witness? No other witness.\\n\\nVery well, gentlemen! Here\\'s a man unknown, proved to have been in\\nthe habit of taking opium in large quantities for a year and a half,\\nfound dead of too much opium. If you think you have any evidence to\\nlead you to the conclusion that he committed suicide, you will come\\nto that conclusion. If you think it is a case of accidental death,\\nyou will find a verdict accordingly.\\n\\nVerdict accordingly. Accidental death. No doubt. Gentlemen, you are\\ndischarged. Good afternoon.\\n\\nWhile the coroner buttons his great-coat, Mr. Tulkinghorn and he give\\nprivate audience to the rejected witness in a corner.\\n\\nThat graceless creature only knows that the dead man (whom he\\nrecognized just now by his yellow face and black hair) was sometimes\\nhooted and pursued about the streets. That one cold winter night when\\nhe, the boy, was shivering in a doorway near his crossing, the man\\nturned to look at him, and came back, and having questioned him and\\nfound that he had not a friend in the world, said, \"Neither have I.\\nNot one!\" and gave him the price of a supper and a night\\'s lodging.\\nThat the man had often spoken to him since and asked him whether he\\nslept sound at night, and how he bore cold and hunger, and whether he\\never wished to die, and similar strange questions. That when the man\\nhad no money, he would say in passing, \"I am as poor as you to-day,\\nJo,\" but that when he had any, he had always (as the boy most\\nheartily believes) been glad to give him some.\\n\\n\"He was wery good to me,\" says the boy, wiping his eyes with his\\nwretched sleeve. \"Wen I see him a-layin\\' so stritched out just now, I\\nwished he could have heerd me tell him so. He wos wery good to me, he\\nwos!\"\\n\\nAs he shuffles downstairs, Mr. Snagsby, lying in wait for him, puts a\\nhalf-crown in his hand. \"If you ever see me coming past your crossing\\nwith my little woman--I mean a lady--\" says Mr. Snagsby with his\\nfinger on his nose, \"don\\'t allude to it!\"\\n\\nFor some little time the jurymen hang about the Sol\\'s Arms\\ncolloquially. In the sequel, half-a-dozen are caught up in a cloud of\\npipe-smoke that pervades the parlour of the Sol\\'s Arms; two stroll to\\nHampstead; and four engage to go half-price to the play at night, and\\ntop up with oysters. Little Swills is treated on several hands. Being\\nasked what he thinks of the proceedings, characterizes them (his\\nstrength lying in a slangular direction) as \"a rummy start.\" The\\nlandlord of the Sol\\'s Arms, finding Little Swills so popular,\\ncommends him highly to the jurymen and public, observing that for a\\nsong in character he don\\'t know his equal and that that man\\'s\\ncharacter-wardrobe would fill a cart.\\n\\nThus, gradually the Sol\\'s Arms melts into the shadowy night and then\\nflares out of it strong in gas. The Harmonic Meeting hour arriving,\\nthe gentleman of professional celebrity takes the chair, is faced\\n(red-faced) by Little Swills; their friends rally round them and\\nsupport first-rate talent. In the zenith of the evening, Little\\nSwills says, \"Gentlemen, if you\\'ll permit me, I\\'ll attempt a short\\ndescription of a scene of real life that came off here to-day.\" Is\\nmuch applauded and encouraged; goes out of the room as Swills; comes\\nin as the coroner (not the least in the world like him); describes\\nthe inquest, with recreative intervals of piano-forte accompaniment,\\nto the refrain: With his (the coroner\\'s) tippy tol li doll, tippy tol\\nlo doll, tippy tol li doll, Dee!\\n\\nThe jingling piano at last is silent, and the Harmonic friends rally\\nround their pillows. Then there is rest around the lonely figure, now\\nlaid in its last earthly habitation; and it is watched by the gaunt\\neyes in the shutters through some quiet hours of night. If this\\nforlorn man could have been prophetically seen lying here by the\\nmother at whose breast he nestled, a little child, with eyes upraised\\nto her loving face, and soft hand scarcely knowing how to close upon\\nthe neck to which it crept, what an impossibility the vision would\\nhave seemed! Oh, if in brighter days the now-extinguished fire within\\nhim ever burned for one woman who held him in her heart, where is\\nshe, while these ashes are above the ground!\\n\\nIt is anything but a night of rest at Mr. Snagsby\\'s, in Cook\\'s Court,\\nwhere Guster murders sleep by going, as Mr. Snagsby himself\\nallows--not to put too fine a point upon it--out of one fit into\\ntwenty. The occasion of this seizure is that Guster has a tender\\nheart and a susceptible something that possibly might have been\\nimagination, but for Tooting and her patron saint. Be it what it may,\\nnow, it was so direfully impressed at tea-time by Mr. Snagsby\\'s\\naccount of the inquiry at which he had assisted that at supper-time\\nshe projected herself into the kitchen, preceded by a flying Dutch\\ncheese, and fell into a fit of unusual duration, which she only came\\nout of to go into another, and another, and so on through a chain of\\nfits, with short intervals between, of which she has pathetically\\navailed herself by consuming them in entreaties to Mrs. Snagsby not\\nto give her warning \"when she quite comes to,\" and also in appeals to\\nthe whole establishment to lay her down on the stones and go to bed.\\nHence, Mr. Snagsby, at last hearing the cock at the little dairy in\\nCursitor Street go into that disinterested ecstasy of his on the\\nsubject of daylight, says, drawing a long breath, though the most\\npatient of men, \"I thought you was dead, I am sure!\"\\n\\nWhat question this enthusiastic fowl supposes he settles when he\\nstrains himself to such an extent, or why he should thus crow (so men\\ncrow on various triumphant public occasions, however) about what\\ncannot be of any moment to him, is his affair. It is enough that\\ndaylight comes, morning comes, noon comes.\\n\\nThen the active and intelligent, who has got into the morning papers\\nas such, comes with his pauper company to Mr. Krook\\'s and bears off\\nthe body of our dear brother here departed to a hemmed-in churchyard,\\npestiferous and obscene, whence malignant diseases are communicated\\nto the bodies of our dear brothers and sisters who have not departed,\\nwhile our dear brothers and sisters who hang about official\\nback-stairs--would to heaven they HAD departed!--are very complacent\\nand agreeable. Into a beastly scrap of ground which a Turk would\\nreject as a savage abomination and a Caffre would shudder at, they\\nbring our dear brother here departed to receive Christian burial.\\n\\nWith houses looking on, on every side, save where a reeking little\\ntunnel of a court gives access to the iron gate--with every villainy\\nof life in action close on death, and every poisonous element of\\ndeath in action close on life--here they lower our dear brother down\\na foot or two, here sow him in corruption, to be raised in\\ncorruption: an avenging ghost at many a sick-bedside, a shameful\\ntestimony to future ages how civilization and barbarism walked this\\nboastful island together.\\n\\nCome night, come darkness, for you cannot come too soon or stay too\\nlong by such a place as this! Come, straggling lights into the\\nwindows of the ugly houses; and you who do iniquity therein, do it at\\nleast with this dread scene shut out! Come, flame of gas, burning so\\nsullenly above the iron gate, on which the poisoned air deposits its\\nwitch-ointment slimy to the touch! It is well that you should call to\\nevery passerby, \"Look here!\"\\n\\nWith the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel-court to\\nthe outside of the iron gate. It holds the gate with its hands and\\nlooks in between the bars, stands looking in for a little while.\\n\\nIt then, with an old broom it carries, softly sweeps the step and\\nmakes the archway clean. It does so very busily and trimly, looks in\\nagain a little while, and so departs.\\n\\nJo, is it thou? Well, well! Though a rejected witness, who \"can\\'t\\nexactly say\" what will be done to him in greater hands than men\\'s,\\nthou art not quite in outer darkness. There is something like a\\ndistant ray of light in thy muttered reason for this: \"He wos wery\\ngood to me, he wos!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt has left off raining down in Lincolnshire at last, and Chesney\\nWold has taken heart. Mrs. Rouncewell is full of hospitable cares,\\nfor Sir Leicester and my Lady are coming home from Paris. The\\nfashionable intelligence has found it out and communicates the glad\\ntidings to benighted England. It has also found out that they will\\nentertain a brilliant and distinguished circle of the ELITE of the\\nBEAU MONDE (the fashionable intelligence is weak in English, but a\\ngiant refreshed in French) at the ancient and hospitable family seat\\nin Lincolnshire.\\n\\nFor the greater honour of the brilliant and distinguished circle, and\\nof Chesney Wold into the bargain, the broken arch of the bridge in\\nthe park is mended; and the water, now retired within its proper\\nlimits and again spanned gracefully, makes a figure in the prospect\\nfrom the house. The clear, cold sunshine glances into the brittle\\nwoods and approvingly beholds the sharp wind scattering the leaves\\nand drying the moss. It glides over the park after the moving shadows\\nof the clouds, and chases them, and never catches them, all day. It\\nlooks in at the windows and touches the ancestral portraits with bars\\nand patches of brightness never contemplated by the painters. Athwart\\nthe picture of my Lady, over the great chimney-piece, it throws a\\nbroad bend-sinister of light that strikes down crookedly into the\\nhearth and seems to rend it.\\n\\nThrough the same cold sunshine and the same sharp wind, my Lady and\\nSir Leicester, in their travelling chariot (my Lady\\'s woman and Sir\\nLeicester\\'s man affectionate in the rumble), start for home. With a\\nconsiderable amount of jingling and whip-cracking, and many plunging\\ndemonstrations on the part of two bare-backed horses and two centaurs\\nwith glazed hats, jack-boots, and flowing manes and tails, they\\nrattle out of the yard of the Hotel Bristol in the Place Vendome and\\ncanter between the sun-and-shadow-chequered colonnade of the Rue de\\nRivoli and the garden of the ill-fated palace of a headless king and\\nqueen, off by the Place of Concord, and the Elysian Fields, and the\\nGate of the Star, out of Paris.\\n\\nSooth to say, they cannot go away too fast, for even here my Lady\\nDedlock has been bored to death. Concert, assembly, opera, theatre,\\ndrive, nothing is new to my Lady under the worn-out heavens. Only\\nlast Sunday, when poor wretches were gay--within the walls playing\\nwith children among the clipped trees and the statues in the Palace\\nGarden; walking, a score abreast, in the Elysian Fields, made more\\nElysian by performing dogs and wooden horses; between whiles\\nfiltering (a few) through the gloomy Cathedral of Our Lady to say a\\nword or two at the base of a pillar within flare of a rusty little\\ngridiron-full of gusty little tapers; without the walls encompassing\\nParis with dancing, love-making, wine-drinking, tobacco-smoking,\\ntomb-visiting, billiard card and domino playing, quack-doctoring, and\\nmuch murderous refuse, animate and inanimate--only last Sunday, my\\nLady, in the desolation of Boredom and the clutch of Giant Despair,\\nalmost hated her own maid for being in spirits.\\n\\nShe cannot, therefore, go too fast from Paris. Weariness of soul lies\\nbefore her, as it lies behind--her Ariel has put a girdle of it round\\nthe whole earth, and it cannot be unclasped--but the imperfect remedy\\nis always to fly from the last place where it has been experienced.\\nFling Paris back into the distance, then, exchanging it for endless\\navenues and cross-avenues of wintry trees! And, when next beheld, let\\nit be some leagues away, with the Gate of the Star a white speck\\nglittering in the sun, and the city a mere mound in a plain--two dark\\nsquare towers rising out of it, and light and shadow descending on it\\naslant, like the angels in Jacob\\'s dream!\\n\\nSir Leicester is generally in a complacent state, and rarely bored.\\nWhen he has nothing else to do, he can always contemplate his own\\ngreatness. It is a considerable advantage to a man to have so\\ninexhaustible a subject. After reading his letters, he leans back in\\nhis corner of the carriage and generally reviews his importance to\\nsociety.\\n\\n\"You have an unusual amount of correspondence this morning?\" says my\\nLady after a long time. She is fatigued with reading. Has almost read\\na page in twenty miles.\\n\\n\"Nothing in it, though. Nothing whatever.\"\\n\\n\"I saw one of Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s long effusions, I think?\"\\n\\n\"You see everything,\" says Sir Leicester with admiration.\\n\\n\"Ha!\" sighs my Lady. \"He is the most tiresome of men!\"\\n\\n\"He sends--I really beg your pardon--he sends,\" says Sir Leicester,\\nselecting the letter and unfolding it, \"a message to you. Our\\nstopping to change horses as I came to his postscript drove it out of\\nmy memory. I beg you\\'ll excuse me. He says--\" Sir Leicester is so\\nlong in taking out his eye-glass and adjusting it that my Lady looks\\na little irritated. \"He says \\'In the matter of the right of way--\\' I\\nbeg your pardon, that\\'s not the place. He says--yes! Here I have it!\\nHe says, \\'I beg my respectful compliments to my Lady, who, I hope,\\nhas benefited by the change. Will you do me the favour to mention (as\\nit may interest her) that I have something to tell her on her return\\nin reference to the person who copied the affidavit in the Chancery\\nsuit, which so powerfully stimulated her curiosity. I have seen\\nhim.\\'\"\\n\\nMy Lady, leaning forward, looks out of her window.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the message,\" observes Sir Leicester.\\n\\n\"I should like to walk a little,\" says my Lady, still looking out of\\nher window.\\n\\n\"Walk?\" repeats Sir Leicester in a tone of surprise.\\n\\n\"I should like to walk a little,\" says my Lady with unmistakable\\ndistinctness. \"Please to stop the carriage.\"\\n\\nThe carriage is stopped, the affectionate man alights from the\\nrumble, opens the door, and lets down the steps, obedient to an\\nimpatient motion of my Lady\\'s hand. My Lady alights so quickly and\\nwalks away so quickly that Sir Leicester, for all his scrupulous\\npoliteness, is unable to assist her, and is left behind. A space of a\\nminute or two has elapsed before he comes up with her. She smiles,\\nlooks very handsome, takes his arm, lounges with him for a quarter of\\na mile, is very much bored, and resumes her seat in the carriage.\\n\\nThe rattle and clatter continue through the greater part of three\\ndays, with more or less of bell-jingling and whip-cracking, and more\\nor less plunging of centaurs and bare-backed horses. Their courtly\\npoliteness to each other at the hotels where they tarry is the theme\\nof general admiration. Though my Lord IS a little aged for my Lady,\\nsays Madame, the hostess of the Golden Ape, and though he might be\\nher amiable father, one can see at a glance that they love each\\nother. One observes my Lord with his white hair, standing, hat in\\nhand, to help my Lady to and from the carriage. One observes my Lady,\\nhow recognisant of my Lord\\'s politeness, with an inclination of her\\ngracious head and the concession of her so-genteel fingers! It is\\nravishing!\\n\\nThe sea has no appreciation of great men, but knocks them about like\\nthe small fry. It is habitually hard upon Sir Leicester, whose\\ncountenance it greenly mottles in the manner of sage-cheese and in\\nwhose aristocratic system it effects a dismal revolution. It is the\\nRadical of Nature to him. Nevertheless, his dignity gets over it\\nafter stopping to refit, and he goes on with my Lady for Chesney\\nWold, lying only one night in London on the way to Lincolnshire.\\n\\nThrough the same cold sunlight, colder as the day declines, and\\nthrough the same sharp wind, sharper as the separate shadows of bare\\ntrees gloom together in the woods, and as the Ghost\\'s Walk, touched\\nat the western corner by a pile of fire in the sky, resigns itself to\\ncoming night, they drive into the park. The rooks, swinging in their\\nlofty houses in the elm-tree avenue, seem to discuss the question of\\nthe occupancy of the carriage as it passes underneath, some agreeing\\nthat Sir Leicester and my Lady are come down, some arguing with\\nmalcontents who won\\'t admit it, now all consenting to consider the\\nquestion disposed of, now all breaking out again in violent debate,\\nincited by one obstinate and drowsy bird who will persist in putting\\nin a last contradictory croak. Leaving them to swing and caw, the\\ntravelling chariot rolls on to the house, where fires gleam warmly\\nthrough some of the windows, though not through so many as to give an\\ninhabited expression to the darkening mass of front. But the\\nbrilliant and distinguished circle will soon do that.\\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell is in attendance and receives Sir Leicester\\'s\\ncustomary shake of the hand with a profound curtsy.\\n\\n\"How do you do, Mrs. Rouncewell? I am glad to see you.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I have the honour of welcoming you in good health, Sir\\nLeicester?\"\\n\\n\"In excellent health, Mrs. Rouncewell.\"\\n\\n\"My Lady is looking charmingly well,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell with\\nanother curtsy.\\n\\nMy Lady signifies, without profuse expenditure of words, that she is\\nas wearily well as she can hope to be.\\n\\nBut Rosa is in the distance, behind the housekeeper; and my Lady, who\\nhas not subdued the quickness of her observation, whatever else she\\nmay have conquered, asks, \"Who is that girl?\"\\n\\n\"A young scholar of mine, my Lady. Rosa.\"\\n\\n\"Come here, Rosa!\" Lady Dedlock beckons her, with even an appearance\\nof interest. \"Why, do you know how pretty you are, child?\" she says,\\ntouching her shoulder with her two forefingers.\\n\\nRosa, very much abashed, says, \"No, if you please, my Lady!\" and\\nglances up, and glances down, and don\\'t know where to look, but looks\\nall the prettier.\\n\\n\"How old are you?\"\\n\\n\"Nineteen, my Lady.\"\\n\\n\"Nineteen,\" repeats my Lady thoughtfully. \"Take care they don\\'t spoil\\nyou by flattery.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my Lady.\"\\n\\nMy Lady taps her dimpled cheek with the same delicate gloved fingers\\nand goes on to the foot of the oak staircase, where Sir Leicester\\npauses for her as her knightly escort. A staring old Dedlock in a\\npanel, as large as life and as dull, looks as if he didn\\'t know what\\nto make of it, which was probably his general state of mind in the\\ndays of Queen Elizabeth.\\n\\nThat evening, in the housekeeper\\'s room, Rosa can do nothing but\\nmurmur Lady Dedlock\\'s praises. She is so affable, so graceful, so\\nbeautiful, so elegant; has such a sweet voice and such a thrilling\\ntouch that Rosa can feel it yet! Mrs. Rouncewell confirms all this,\\nnot without personal pride, reserving only the one point of\\naffability. Mrs. Rouncewell is not quite sure as to that. Heaven\\nforbid that she should say a syllable in dispraise of any member of\\nthat excellent family, above all, of my Lady, whom the whole world\\nadmires; but if my Lady would only be \"a little more free,\" not quite\\nso cold and distant, Mrs. Rouncewell thinks she would be more\\naffable.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis almost a pity,\" Mrs. Rouncewell adds--only \"almost\" because it\\nborders on impiety to suppose that anything could be better than it\\nis, in such an express dispensation as the Dedlock affairs--\"that my\\nLady has no family. If she had had a daughter now, a grown young\\nlady, to interest her, I think she would have had the only kind of\\nexcellence she wants.\"\\n\\n\"Might not that have made her still more proud, grandmother?\" says\\nWatt, who has been home and come back again, he is such a good\\ngrandson.\\n\\n\"More and most, my dear,\" returns the housekeeper with dignity, \"are\\nwords it\\'s not my place to use--nor so much as to hear--applied to\\nany drawback on my Lady.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, grandmother. But she is proud, is she not?\"\\n\\n\"If she is, she has reason to be. The Dedlock family have always\\nreason to be.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" says Watt, \"it\\'s to be hoped they line out of their\\nprayer-books a certain passage for the common people about pride and\\nvainglory. Forgive me, grandmother! Only a joke!\"\\n\\n\"Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock, my dear, are not fit subjects for\\njoking.\"\\n\\n\"Sir Leicester is no joke by any means,\" says Watt, \"and I humbly ask\\nhis pardon. I suppose, grandmother, that even with the family and\\ntheir guests down here, there is no objection to my prolonging my\\nstay at the Dedlock Arms for a day or two, as any other traveller\\nmight?\"\\n\\n\"Surely, none in the world, child.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad of that,\" says Watt, \"because I have an inexpressible\\ndesire to extend my knowledge of this beautiful neighbourhood.\"\\n\\nHe happens to glance at Rosa, who looks down and is very shy indeed.\\nBut according to the old superstition, it should be Rosa\\'s ears that\\nburn, and not her fresh bright cheeks, for my Lady\\'s maid is holding\\nforth about her at this moment with surpassing energy.\\n\\nMy Lady\\'s maid is a Frenchwoman of two and thirty, from somewhere in\\nthe southern country about Avignon and Marseilles, a large-eyed brown\\nwoman with black hair who would be handsome but for a certain feline\\nmouth and general uncomfortable tightness of face, rendering the jaws\\ntoo eager and the skull too prominent. There is something indefinably\\nkeen and wan about her anatomy, and she has a watchful way of looking\\nout of the corners of her eyes without turning her head which could\\nbe pleasantly dispensed with, especially when she is in an ill humour\\nand near knives. Through all the good taste of her dress and little\\nadornments, these objections so express themselves that she seems to\\ngo about like a very neat she-wolf imperfectly tamed. Besides being\\naccomplished in all the knowledge appertaining to her post, she is\\nalmost an Englishwoman in her acquaintance with the language;\\nconsequently, she is in no want of words to shower upon Rosa for\\nhaving attracted my Lady\\'s attention, and she pours them out with\\nsuch grim ridicule as she sits at dinner that her companion, the\\naffectionate man, is rather relieved when she arrives at the spoon\\nstage of that performance.\\n\\nHa, ha, ha! She, Hortense, been in my Lady\\'s service since five years\\nand always kept at the distance, and this doll, this puppet,\\ncaressed--absolutely caressed--by my Lady on the moment of her\\narriving at the house! Ha, ha, ha! \"And do you know how pretty you\\nare, child?\" \"No, my Lady.\" You are right there! \"And how old are\\nyou, child! And take care they do not spoil you by flattery, child!\"\\nOh, how droll! It is the BEST thing altogether.\\n\\nIn short, it is such an admirable thing that Mademoiselle Hortense\\ncan\\'t forget it; but at meals for days afterwards, even among her\\ncountrywomen and others attached in like capacity to the troop of\\nvisitors, relapses into silent enjoyment of the joke--an enjoyment\\nexpressed, in her own convivial manner, by an additional tightness of\\nface, thin elongation of compressed lips, and sidewise look, which\\nintense appreciation of humour is frequently reflected in my Lady\\'s\\nmirrors when my Lady is not among them.\\n\\nAll the mirrors in the house are brought into action now, many of\\nthem after a long blank. They reflect handsome faces, simpering\\nfaces, youthful faces, faces of threescore and ten that will not\\nsubmit to be old; the entire collection of faces that have come to\\npass a January week or two at Chesney Wold, and which the fashionable\\nintelligence, a mighty hunter before the Lord, hunts with a keen\\nscent, from their breaking cover at the Court of St. James\\'s to their\\nbeing run down to death. The place in Lincolnshire is all alive. By\\nday guns and voices are heard ringing in the woods, horsemen and\\ncarriages enliven the park roads, servants and hangers-on pervade the\\nvillage and the Dedlock Arms. Seen by night from distant openings in\\nthe trees, the row of windows in the long drawing-room, where my\\nLady\\'s picture hangs over the great chimney-piece, is like a row of\\njewels set in a black frame. On Sunday the chill little church is\\nalmost warmed by so much gallant company, and the general flavour of\\nthe Dedlock dust is quenched in delicate perfumes.\\n\\nThe brilliant and distinguished circle comprehends within it no\\ncontracted amount of education, sense, courage, honour, beauty, and\\nvirtue. Yet there is something a little wrong about it in despite of\\nits immense advantages. What can it be?\\n\\nDandyism? There is no King George the Fourth now (more the pity) to\\nset the dandy fashion; there are no clear-starched jack-towel\\nneckcloths, no short-waisted coats, no false calves, no stays. There\\nare no caricatures, now, of effeminate exquisites so arrayed,\\nswooning in opera boxes with excess of delight and being revived by\\nother dainty creatures poking long-necked scent-bottles at their\\nnoses. There is no beau whom it takes four men at once to shake into\\nhis buckskins, or who goes to see all the executions, or who is\\ntroubled with the self-reproach of having once consumed a pea. But is\\nthere dandyism in the brilliant and distinguished circle\\nnotwithstanding, dandyism of a more mischievous sort, that has got\\nbelow the surface and is doing less harmless things than\\njack-towelling itself and stopping its own digestion, to which no\\nrational person need particularly object?\\n\\nWhy, yes. It cannot be disguised. There ARE at Chesney Wold this\\nJanuary week some ladies and gentlemen of the newest fashion, who\\nhave set up a dandyism--in religion, for instance. Who in mere\\nlackadaisical want of an emotion have agreed upon a little dandy talk\\nabout the vulgar wanting faith in things in general, meaning in the\\nthings that have been tried and found wanting, as though a low fellow\\nshould unaccountably lose faith in a bad shilling after finding it\\nout! Who would make the vulgar very picturesque and faithful by\\nputting back the hands upon the clock of time and cancelling a few\\nhundred years of history.\\n\\nThere are also ladies and gentlemen of another fashion, not so new,\\nbut very elegant, who have agreed to put a smooth glaze on the world\\nand to keep down all its realities. For whom everything must be\\nlanguid and pretty. Who have found out the perpetual stoppage. Who\\nare to rejoice at nothing and be sorry for nothing. Who are not to be\\ndisturbed by ideas. On whom even the fine arts, attending in powder\\nand walking backward like the Lord Chamberlain, must array themselves\\nin the milliners\\' and tailors\\' patterns of past generations and be\\nparticularly careful not to be in earnest or to receive any impress\\nfrom the moving age.\\n\\nThen there is my Lord Boodle, of considerable reputation with his\\nparty, who has known what office is and who tells Sir Leicester\\nDedlock with much gravity, after dinner, that he really does not see\\nto what the present age is tending. A debate is not what a debate\\nused to be; the House is not what the House used to be; even a\\nCabinet is not what it formerly was. He perceives with astonishment\\nthat supposing the present government to be overthrown, the limited\\nchoice of the Crown, in the formation of a new ministry, would lie\\nbetween Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle--supposing it to be\\nimpossible for the Duke of Foodle to act with Goodle, which may be\\nassumed to be the case in consequence of the breach arising out of\\nthat affair with Hoodle. Then, giving the Home Department and the\\nleadership of the House of Commons to Joodle, the Exchequer to\\nKoodle, the Colonies to Loodle, and the Foreign Office to Moodle,\\nwhat are you to do with Noodle? You can\\'t offer him the Presidency of\\nthe Council; that is reserved for Poodle. You can\\'t put him in the\\nWoods and Forests; that is hardly good enough for Quoodle. What\\nfollows? That the country is shipwrecked, lost, and gone to pieces\\n(as is made manifest to the patriotism of Sir Leicester Dedlock)\\nbecause you can\\'t provide for Noodle!\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Right Honourable William Buffy, M.P., contends\\nacross the table with some one else that the shipwreck of the\\ncountry--about which there is no doubt; it is only the manner of it\\nthat is in question--is attributable to Cuffy. If you had done with\\nCuffy what you ought to have done when he first came into Parliament,\\nand had prevented him from going over to Duffy, you would have got\\nhim into alliance with Fuffy, you would have had with you the weight\\nattaching as a smart debater to Guffy, you would have brought to bear\\nupon the elections the wealth of Huffy, you would have got in for\\nthree counties Juffy, Kuffy, and Luffy, and you would have\\nstrengthened your administration by the official knowledge and the\\nbusiness habits of Muffy. All this, instead of being as you now are,\\ndependent on the mere caprice of Puffy!\\n\\nAs to this point, and as to some minor topics, there are differences\\nof opinion; but it is perfectly clear to the brilliant and\\ndistinguished circle, all round, that nobody is in question but\\nBoodle and his retinue, and Buffy and HIS retinue. These are the\\ngreat actors for whom the stage is reserved. A People there are, no\\ndoubt--a certain large number of supernumeraries, who are to be\\noccasionally addressed, and relied upon for shouts and choruses, as\\non the theatrical stage; but Boodle and Buffy, their followers and\\nfamilies, their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, are\\nthe born first-actors, managers, and leaders, and no others can\\nappear upon the scene for ever and ever.\\n\\nIn this, too, there is perhaps more dandyism at Chesney Wold than the\\nbrilliant and distinguished circle will find good for itself in the\\nlong run. For it is, even with the stillest and politest circles, as\\nwith the circle the necromancer draws around him--very strange\\nappearances may be seen in active motion outside. With this\\ndifference, that being realities and not phantoms, there is the\\ngreater danger of their breaking in.\\n\\nChesney Wold is quite full anyhow, so full that a burning sense of\\ninjury arises in the breasts of ill-lodged ladies\\'-maids, and is not\\nto be extinguished. Only one room is empty. It is a turret chamber of\\nthe third order of merit, plainly but comfortably furnished and\\nhaving an old-fashioned business air. It is Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s room,\\nand is never bestowed on anybody else, for he may come at any time.\\nHe is not come yet. It is his quiet habit to walk across the park\\nfrom the village in fine weather, to drop into this room as if he had\\nnever been out of it since he was last seen there, to request a\\nservant to inform Sir Leicester that he is arrived in case he should\\nbe wanted, and to appear ten minutes before dinner in the shadow of\\nthe library-door. He sleeps in his turret with a complaining\\nflag-staff over his head, and has some leads outside on which, any\\nfine morning when he is down here, his black figure may be seen\\nwalking before breakfast like a larger species of rook.\\n\\nEvery day before dinner, my Lady looks for him in the dusk of the\\nlibrary, but he is not there. Every day at dinner, my Lady glances\\ndown the table for the vacant place that would be waiting to receive\\nhim if he had just arrived, but there is no vacant place. Every night\\nmy Lady casually asks her maid, \"Is Mr. Tulkinghorn come?\"\\n\\nEvery night the answer is, \"No, my Lady, not yet.\"\\n\\nOne night, while having her hair undressed, my Lady loses herself in\\ndeep thought after this reply until she sees her own brooding face in\\nthe opposite glass, and a pair of black eyes curiously observing her.\\n\\n\"Be so good as to attend,\" says my Lady then, addressing the\\nreflection of Hortense, \"to your business. You can contemplate your\\nbeauty at another time.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon! It was your Ladyship\\'s beauty.\"\\n\\n\"That,\" says my Lady, \"you needn\\'t contemplate at all.\"\\n\\nAt length, one afternoon a little before sunset, when the bright\\ngroups of figures which have for the last hour or two enlivened the\\nGhost\\'s Walk are all dispersed and only Sir Leicester and my Lady\\nremain upon the terrace, Mr. Tulkinghorn appears. He comes towards\\nthem at his usual methodical pace, which is never quickened, never\\nslackened. He wears his usual expressionless mask--if it be a\\nmask--and carries family secrets in every limb of his body and every\\ncrease of his dress. Whether his whole soul is devoted to the great\\nor whether he yields them nothing beyond the services he sells is his\\npersonal secret. He keeps it, as he keeps the secrets of his clients;\\nhe is his own client in that matter, and will never betray himself.\\n\\n\"How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?\" says Sir Leicester, giving him his\\nhand.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn is quite well. Sir Leicester is quite well. My Lady\\nis quite well. All highly satisfactory. The lawyer, with his hands\\nbehind him, walks at Sir Leicester\\'s side along the terrace. My Lady\\nwalks upon the other side.\\n\\n\"We expected you before,\" says Sir Leicester. A gracious observation.\\nAs much as to say, \"Mr. Tulkinghorn, we remember your existence when\\nyou are not here to remind us of it by your presence. We bestow a\\nfragment of our minds upon you, sir, you see!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn, comprehending it, inclines his head and says he is\\nmuch obliged.\\n\\n\"I should have come down sooner,\" he explains, \"but that I have been\\nmuch engaged with those matters in the several suits between yourself\\nand Boythorn.\"\\n\\n\"A man of a very ill-regulated mind,\" observes Sir Leicester with\\nseverity. \"An extremely dangerous person in any community. A man of a\\nvery low character of mind.\"\\n\\n\"He is obstinate,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"It is natural to such a man to be so,\" says Sir Leicester, looking\\nmost profoundly obstinate himself. \"I am not at all surprised to hear\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"The only question is,\" pursues the lawyer, \"whether you will give up\\nanything.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replies Sir Leicester. \"Nothing. I give up?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mean anything of importance. That, of course, I know you\\nwould not abandon. I mean any minor point.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" returns Sir Leicester, \"there can be no minor\\npoint between myself and Mr. Boythorn. If I go farther, and observe\\nthat I cannot readily conceive how ANY right of mine can be a minor\\npoint, I speak not so much in reference to myself as an individual as\\nin reference to the family position I have it in charge to maintain.\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn inclines his head again. \"I have now my\\ninstructions,\" he says. \"Mr. Boythorn will give us a good deal of\\ntrouble--\"\\n\\n\"It is the character of such a mind, Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" Sir Leicester\\ninterrupts him, \"TO give trouble. An exceedingly ill-conditioned,\\nlevelling person. A person who, fifty years ago, would probably have\\nbeen tried at the Old Bailey for some demagogue proceeding, and\\nseverely punished--if not,\" adds Sir Leicester after a moment\\'s\\npause, \"if not hanged, drawn, and quartered.\"\\n\\nSir Leicester appears to discharge his stately breast of a burden in\\npassing this capital sentence, as if it were the next satisfactory\\nthing to having the sentence executed.\\n\\n\"But night is coming on,\" says he, \"and my Lady will take cold. My\\ndear, let us go in.\"\\n\\nAs they turn towards the hall-door, Lady Dedlock addresses Mr.\\nTulkinghorn for the first time.\\n\\n\"You sent me a message respecting the person whose writing I happened\\nto inquire about. It was like you to remember the circumstance; I had\\nquite forgotten it. Your message reminded me of it again. I can\\'t\\nimagine what association I had with a hand like that, but I surely\\nhad some.\"\\n\\n\"You had some?\" Mr. Tulkinghorn repeats.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" returns my Lady carelessly. \"I think I must have had some.\\nAnd did you really take the trouble to find out the writer of that\\nactual thing--what is it!--affidavit?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"How very odd!\"\\n\\nThey pass into a sombre breakfast-room on the ground floor, lighted\\nin the day by two deep windows. It is now twilight. The fire glows\\nbrightly on the panelled wall and palely on the window-glass, where,\\nthrough the cold reflection of the blaze, the colder landscape\\nshudders in the wind and a grey mist creeps along, the only traveller\\nbesides the waste of clouds.\\n\\nMy Lady lounges in a great chair in the chimney-corner, and Sir\\nLeicester takes another great chair opposite. The lawyer stands\\nbefore the fire with his hand out at arm\\'s length, shading his face.\\nHe looks across his arm at my Lady.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he says, \"I inquired about the man, and found him. And, what\\nis very strange, I found him--\"\\n\\n\"Not to be any out-of-the-way person, I am afraid!\" Lady Dedlock\\nlanguidly anticipates.\\n\\n\"I found him dead.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear me!\" remonstrated Sir Leicester. Not so much shocked by the\\nfact as by the fact of the fact being mentioned.\\n\\n\"I was directed to his lodging--a miserable, poverty-stricken\\nplace--and I found him dead.\"\\n\\n\"You will excuse me, Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" observes Sir Leicester. \"I\\nthink the less said--\"\\n\\n\"Pray, Sir Leicester, let me hear the story out\" (it is my Lady\\nspeaking). \"It is quite a story for twilight. How very shocking!\\nDead?\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn re-asserts it by another inclination of his head.\\n\"Whether by his own hand--\"\\n\\n\"Upon my honour!\" cries Sir Leicester. \"Really!\"\\n\\n\"Do let me hear the story!\" says my Lady.\\n\\n\"Whatever you desire, my dear. But, I must say--\"\\n\\n\"No, you mustn\\'t say! Go on, Mr. Tulkinghorn.\"\\n\\nSir Leicester\\'s gallantry concedes the point, though he still feels\\nthat to bring this sort of squalor among the upper classes is\\nreally--really--\\n\\n\"I was about to say,\" resumes the lawyer with undisturbed calmness,\\n\"that whether he had died by his own hand or not, it was beyond my\\npower to tell you. I should amend that phrase, however, by saying\\nthat he had unquestionably died of his own act, though whether by his\\nown deliberate intention or by mischance can never certainly be\\nknown. The coroner\\'s jury found that he took the poison\\naccidentally.\"\\n\\n\"And what kind of man,\" my Lady asks, \"was this deplorable creature?\"\\n\\n\"Very difficult to say,\" returns the lawyer, shaking his head. \"He\\nhad lived so wretchedly and was so neglected, with his gipsy colour\\nand his wild black hair and beard, that I should have considered him\\nthe commonest of the common. The surgeon had a notion that he had\\nonce been something better, both in appearance and condition.\"\\n\\n\"What did they call the wretched being?\"\\n\\n\"They called him what he had called himself, but no one knew his\\nname.\"\\n\\n\"Not even any one who had attended on him?\"\\n\\n\"No one had attended on him. He was found dead. In fact, I found\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"Without any clue to anything more?\"\\n\\n\"Without any; there was,\" says the lawyer meditatively, \"an old\\nportmanteau, but--No, there were no papers.\"\\n\\nDuring the utterance of every word of this short dialogue, Lady\\nDedlock and Mr. Tulkinghorn, without any other alteration in their\\ncustomary deportment, have looked very steadily at one another--as\\nwas natural, perhaps, in the discussion of so unusual a subject. Sir\\nLeicester has looked at the fire, with the general expression of the\\nDedlock on the staircase. The story being told, he renews his stately\\nprotest, saying that as it is quite clear that no association in my\\nLady\\'s mind can possibly be traceable to this poor wretch (unless he\\nwas a begging-letter writer), he trusts to hear no more about a\\nsubject so far removed from my Lady\\'s station.\\n\\n\"Certainly, a collection of horrors,\" says my Lady, gathering up her\\nmantles and furs, \"but they interest one for the moment! Have the\\nkindness, Mr. Tulkinghorn, to open the door for me.\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn does so with deference and holds it open while she\\npasses out. She passes close to him, with her usual fatigued manner\\nand insolent grace. They meet again at dinner--again, next\\nday--again, for many days in succession. Lady Dedlock is always the\\nsame exhausted deity, surrounded by worshippers, and terribly liable\\nto be bored to death, even while presiding at her own shrine. Mr.\\nTulkinghorn is always the same speechless repository of noble\\nconfidences, so oddly out of place and yet so perfectly at home. They\\nappear to take as little note of one another as any two people\\nenclosed within the same walls could. But whether each evermore\\nwatches and suspects the other, evermore mistrustful of some great\\nreservation; whether each is evermore prepared at all points for the\\nother, and never to be taken unawares; what each would give to know\\nhow much the other knows--all this is hidden, for the time, in their\\nown hearts.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe held many consultations about what Richard was to be, first\\nwithout Mr. Jarndyce, as he had requested, and afterwards with him,\\nbut it was a long time before we seemed to make progress. Richard\\nsaid he was ready for anything. When Mr. Jarndyce doubted whether he\\nmight not already be too old to enter the Navy, Richard said he had\\nthought of that, and perhaps he was. When Mr. Jarndyce asked him what\\nhe thought of the Army, Richard said he had thought of that, too, and\\nit wasn\\'t a bad idea. When Mr. Jarndyce advised him to try and decide\\nwithin himself whether his old preference for the sea was an ordinary\\nboyish inclination or a strong impulse, Richard answered, Well he\\nreally HAD tried very often, and he couldn\\'t make out.\\n\\n\"How much of this indecision of character,\" Mr. Jarndyce said to me,\\n\"is chargeable on that incomprehensible heap of uncertainty and\\nprocrastination on which he has been thrown from his birth, I don\\'t\\npretend to say; but that Chancery, among its other sins, is\\nresponsible for some of it, I can plainly see. It has engendered or\\nconfirmed in him a habit of putting off--and trusting to this, that,\\nand the other chance, without knowing what chance--and dismissing\\neverything as unsettled, uncertain, and confused. The character of\\nmuch older and steadier people may be even changed by the\\ncircumstances surrounding them. It would be too much to expect that a\\nboy\\'s, in its formation, should be the subject of such influences and\\nescape them.\"\\n\\nI felt this to be true; though if I may venture to mention what I\\nthought besides, I thought it much to be regretted that Richard\\'s\\neducation had not counteracted those influences or directed his\\ncharacter. He had been eight years at a public school and had learnt,\\nI understood, to make Latin verses of several sorts in the most\\nadmirable manner. But I never heard that it had been anybody\\'s\\nbusiness to find out what his natural bent was, or where his failings\\nlay, or to adapt any kind of knowledge to HIM. HE had been adapted to\\nthe verses and had learnt the art of making them to such perfection\\nthat if he had remained at school until he was of age, I suppose he\\ncould only have gone on making them over and over again unless he had\\nenlarged his education by forgetting how to do it. Still, although I\\nhad no doubt that they were very beautiful, and very improving, and\\nvery sufficient for a great many purposes of life, and always\\nremembered all through life, I did doubt whether Richard would not\\nhave profited by some one studying him a little, instead of his\\nstudying them quite so much.\\n\\nTo be sure, I knew nothing of the subject and do not even now know\\nwhether the young gentlemen of classic Rome or Greece made verses to\\nthe same extent--or whether the young gentlemen of any country ever\\ndid.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t the least idea,\" said Richard, musing, \"what I had better\\nbe. Except that I am quite sure I don\\'t want to go into the Church,\\nit\\'s a toss-up.\"\\n\\n\"You have no inclination in Mr. Kenge\\'s way?\" suggested Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know that, sir!\" replied Richard. \"I am fond of boating.\\nArticled clerks go a good deal on the water. It\\'s a capital\\nprofession!\"\\n\\n\"Surgeon--\" suggested Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the thing, sir!\" cried Richard.\\n\\nI doubt if he had ever once thought of it before.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the thing, sir,\" repeated Richard with the greatest\\nenthusiasm. \"We have got it at last. M.R.C.S.!\"\\n\\nHe was not to be laughed out of it, though he laughed at it heartily.\\nHe said he had chosen his profession, and the more he thought of it,\\nthe more he felt that his destiny was clear; the art of healing was\\nthe art of all others for him. Mistrusting that he only came to this\\nconclusion because, having never had much chance of finding out for\\nhimself what he was fitted for and having never been guided to the\\ndiscovery, he was taken by the newest idea and was glad to get rid of\\nthe trouble of consideration, I wondered whether the Latin verses\\noften ended in this or whether Richard\\'s was a solitary case.\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce took great pains to talk with him seriously and to put\\nit to his good sense not to deceive himself in so important a matter.\\nRichard was a little grave after these interviews, but invariably\\ntold Ada and me that it was all right, and then began to talk about\\nsomething else.\\n\\n\"By heaven!\" cried Mr. Boythorn, who interested himself strongly in\\nthe subject--though I need not say that, for he could do nothing\\nweakly; \"I rejoice to find a young gentleman of spirit and gallantry\\ndevoting himself to that noble profession! The more spirit there is\\nin it, the better for mankind and the worse for those mercenary\\ntask-masters and low tricksters who delight in putting that\\nillustrious art at a disadvantage in the world. By all that is base\\nand despicable,\" cried Mr. Boythorn, \"the treatment of surgeons\\naboard ship is such that I would submit the legs--both legs--of every\\nmember of the Admiralty Board to a compound fracture and render it a\\ntransportable offence in any qualified practitioner to set them if\\nthe system were not wholly changed in eight and forty hours!\"\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t you give them a week?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"No!\" cried Mr. Boythorn firmly. \"Not on any consideration! Eight and\\nforty hours! As to corporations, parishes, vestry-boards, and similar\\ngatherings of jolter-headed clods who assemble to exchange such\\nspeeches that, by heaven, they ought to be worked in quicksilver\\nmines for the short remainder of their miserable existence, if it\\nwere only to prevent their detestable English from contaminating a\\nlanguage spoken in the presence of the sun--as to those fellows, who\\nmeanly take advantage of the ardour of gentlemen in the pursuit of\\nknowledge to recompense the inestimable services of the best years of\\ntheir lives, their long study, and their expensive education with\\npittances too small for the acceptance of clerks, I would have the\\nnecks of every one of them wrung and their skulls arranged in\\nSurgeons\\' Hall for the contemplation of the whole profession in order\\nthat its younger members might understand from actual measurement, in\\nearly life, HOW thick skulls may become!\"\\n\\nHe wound up this vehement declaration by looking round upon us with a\\nmost agreeable smile and suddenly thundering, \"Ha, ha, ha!\" over and\\nover again, until anybody else might have been expected to be quite\\nsubdued by the exertion.\\n\\nAs Richard still continued to say that he was fixed in his choice\\nafter repeated periods for consideration had been recommended by Mr.\\nJarndyce and had expired, and he still continued to assure Ada and me\\nin the same final manner that it was \"all right,\" it became advisable\\nto take Mr. Kenge into council. Mr. Kenge, therefore, came down to\\ndinner one day, and leaned back in his chair, and turned his\\neye-glasses over and over, and spoke in a sonorous voice, and did\\nexactly what I remembered to have seen him do when I was a little\\ngirl.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Yes. Well! A very good profession, Mr.\\nJarndyce, a very good profession.\"\\n\\n\"The course of study and preparation requires to be diligently\\npursued,\" observed my guardian with a glance at Richard.\\n\\n\"Oh, no doubt,\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Diligently.\"\\n\\n\"But that being the case, more or less, with all pursuits that are\\nworth much,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"it is not a special consideration\\nwhich another choice would be likely to escape.\"\\n\\n\"Truly,\" said Mr. Kenge. \"And Mr. Richard Carstone, who has so\\nmeritoriously acquitted himself in the--shall I say the classic\\nshades?--in which his youth had been passed, will, no doubt, apply\\nthe habits, if not the principles and practice, of versification in\\nthat tongue in which a poet was said (unless I mistake) to be born,\\nnot made, to the more eminently practical field of action on which he\\nenters.\"\\n\\n\"You may rely upon it,\" said Richard in his off-hand manner, \"that I\\nshall go at it and do my best.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, Mr. Jarndyce!\" said Mr. Kenge, gently nodding his head.\\n\"Really, when we are assured by Mr. Richard that he means to go at it\\nand to do his best,\" nodding feelingly and smoothly over those\\nexpressions, \"I would submit to you that we have only to inquire into\\nthe best mode of carrying out the object of his ambition. Now, with\\nreference to placing Mr. Richard with some sufficiently eminent\\npractitioner. Is there any one in view at present?\"\\n\\n\"No one, Rick, I think?\" said my guardian.\\n\\n\"No one, sir,\" said Richard.\\n\\n\"Quite so!\" observed Mr. Kenge. \"As to situation, now. Is there any\\nparticular feeling on that head?\"\\n\\n\"N--no,\" said Richard.\\n\\n\"Quite so!\" observed Mr. Kenge again.\\n\\n\"I should like a little variety,\" said Richard; \"I mean a good range\\nof experience.\"\\n\\n\"Very requisite, no doubt,\" returned Mr. Kenge. \"I think this may be\\neasily arranged, Mr. Jarndyce? We have only, in the first place, to\\ndiscover a sufficiently eligible practitioner; and as soon as we make\\nour want--and shall I add, our ability to pay a premium?--known, our\\nonly difficulty will be in the selection of one from a large number.\\nWe have only, in the second place, to observe those little\\nformalities which are rendered necessary by our time of life and our\\nbeing under the guardianship of the court. We shall soon be--shall I\\nsay, in Mr. Richard\\'s own light-hearted manner, \\'going at it\\'--to our\\nheart\\'s content. It is a coincidence,\" said Mr. Kenge with a tinge of\\nmelancholy in his smile, \"one of those coincidences which may or may\\nnot require an explanation beyond our present limited faculties, that\\nI have a cousin in the medical profession. He might be deemed\\neligible by you and might be disposed to respond to this proposal. I\\ncan answer for him as little as for you, but he MIGHT!\"\\n\\nAs this was an opening in the prospect, it was arranged that Mr.\\nKenge should see his cousin. And as Mr. Jarndyce had before proposed\\nto take us to London for a few weeks, it was settled next day that we\\nshould make our visit at once and combine Richard\\'s business with it.\\n\\nMr. Boythorn leaving us within a week, we took up our abode at a\\ncheerful lodging near Oxford Street over an upholsterer\\'s shop.\\nLondon was a great wonder to us, and we were out for hours and hours\\nat a time, seeing the sights, which appeared to be less capable of\\nexhaustion than we were. We made the round of the principal theatres,\\ntoo, with great delight, and saw all the plays that were worth\\nseeing. I mention this because it was at the theatre that I began to\\nbe made uncomfortable again by Mr. Guppy.\\n\\nI was sitting in front of the box one night with Ada, and Richard was\\nin the place he liked best, behind Ada\\'s chair, when, happening to\\nlook down into the pit, I saw Mr. Guppy, with his hair flattened down\\nupon his head and woe depicted in his face, looking up at me. I felt\\nall through the performance that he never looked at the actors but\\nconstantly looked at me, and always with a carefully prepared\\nexpression of the deepest misery and the profoundest dejection.\\n\\nIt quite spoiled my pleasure for that night because it was so very\\nembarrassing and so very ridiculous. But from that time forth, we\\nnever went to the play without my seeing Mr. Guppy in the pit, always\\nwith his hair straight and flat, his shirt-collar turned down, and a\\ngeneral feebleness about him. If he were not there when we went in,\\nand I began to hope he would not come and yielded myself for a little\\nwhile to the interest of the scene, I was certain to encounter his\\nlanguishing eyes when I least expected it and, from that time, to be\\nquite sure that they were fixed upon me all the evening.\\n\\nI really cannot express how uneasy this made me. If he would only\\nhave brushed up his hair or turned up his collar, it would have been\\nbad enough; but to know that that absurd figure was always gazing at\\nme, and always in that demonstrative state of despondency, put such a\\nconstraint upon me that I did not like to laugh at the play, or to\\ncry at it, or to move, or to speak. I seemed able to do nothing\\nnaturally. As to escaping Mr. Guppy by going to the back of the box,\\nI could not bear to do that because I knew Richard and Ada relied on\\nhaving me next them and that they could never have talked together so\\nhappily if anybody else had been in my place. So there I sat, not\\nknowing where to look--for wherever I looked, I knew Mr. Guppy\\'s eyes\\nwere following me--and thinking of the dreadful expense to which this\\nyoung man was putting himself on my account.\\n\\nSometimes I thought of telling Mr. Jarndyce. Then I feared that the\\nyoung man would lose his situation and that I might ruin him.\\nSometimes I thought of confiding in Richard, but was deterred by the\\npossibility of his fighting Mr. Guppy and giving him black eyes.\\nSometimes I thought, should I frown at him or shake my head. Then I\\nfelt I could not do it. Sometimes I considered whether I should write\\nto his mother, but that ended in my being convinced that to open a\\ncorrespondence would be to make the matter worse. I always came to\\nthe conclusion, finally, that I could do nothing. Mr. Guppy\\'s\\nperseverance, all this time, not only produced him regularly at any\\ntheatre to which we went, but caused him to appear in the crowd as we\\nwere coming out, and even to get up behind our fly--where I am sure I\\nsaw him, two or three times, struggling among the most dreadful\\nspikes. After we got home, he haunted a post opposite our house. The\\nupholsterer\\'s where we lodged being at the corner of two streets, and\\nmy bedroom window being opposite the post, I was afraid to go near\\nthe window when I went upstairs, lest I should see him (as I did one\\nmoonlight night) leaning against the post and evidently catching\\ncold. If Mr. Guppy had not been, fortunately for me, engaged in the\\ndaytime, I really should have had no rest from him.\\n\\nWhile we were making this round of gaieties, in which Mr. Guppy so\\nextraordinarily participated, the business which had helped to bring\\nus to town was not neglected. Mr. Kenge\\'s cousin was a Mr. Bayham\\nBadger, who had a good practice at Chelsea and attended a large\\npublic institution besides. He was quite willing to receive Richard\\ninto his house and to superintend his studies, and as it seemed that\\nthose could be pursued advantageously under Mr. Badger\\'s roof, and\\nMr. Badger liked Richard, and as Richard said he liked Mr. Badger\\n\"well enough,\" an agreement was made, the Lord Chancellor\\'s consent\\nwas obtained, and it was all settled.\\n\\nOn the day when matters were concluded between Richard and Mr.\\nBadger, we were all under engagement to dine at Mr. Badger\\'s house.\\nWe were to be \"merely a family party,\" Mrs. Badger\\'s note said; and\\nwe found no lady there but Mrs. Badger herself. She was surrounded in\\nthe drawing-room by various objects, indicative of her painting a\\nlittle, playing the piano a little, playing the guitar a little,\\nplaying the harp a little, singing a little, working a little,\\nreading a little, writing poetry a little, and botanizing a little.\\nShe was a lady of about fifty, I should think, youthfully dressed,\\nand of a very fine complexion. If I add to the little list of her\\naccomplishments that she rouged a little, I do not mean that there\\nwas any harm in it.\\n\\nMr. Bayham Badger himself was a pink, fresh-faced, crisp-looking\\ngentleman with a weak voice, white teeth, light hair, and surprised\\neyes, some years younger, I should say, than Mrs. Bayham Badger. He\\nadmired her exceedingly, but principally, and to begin with, on the\\ncurious ground (as it seemed to us) of her having had three husbands.\\nWe had barely taken our seats when he said to Mr. Jarndyce quite\\ntriumphantly, \"You would hardly suppose that I am Mrs. Bayham\\nBadger\\'s third!\"\\n\\n\"Indeed?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Her third!\" said Mr. Badger. \"Mrs. Bayham Badger has not the\\nappearance, Miss Summerson, of a lady who has had two former\\nhusbands?\"\\n\\nI said \"Not at all!\"\\n\\n\"And most remarkable men!\" said Mr. Badger in a tone of confidence.\\n\"Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy, who was Mrs. Badger\\'s first\\nhusband, was a very distinguished officer indeed. The name of\\nProfessor Dingo, my immediate predecessor, is one of European\\nreputation.\"\\n\\nMrs. Badger overheard him and smiled.\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear!\" Mr. Badger replied to the smile, \"I was observing to\\nMr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson that you had had two former\\nhusbands--both very distinguished men. And they found it, as people\\ngenerally do, difficult to believe.\"\\n\\n\"I was barely twenty,\" said Mrs. Badger, \"when I married Captain\\nSwosser of the Royal Navy. I was in the Mediterranean with him; I am\\nquite a sailor. On the twelfth anniversary of my wedding-day, I\\nbecame the wife of Professor Dingo.\"\\n\\n\"Of European reputation,\" added Mr. Badger in an undertone.\\n\\n\"And when Mr. Badger and myself were married,\" pursued Mrs. Badger,\\n\"we were married on the same day of the year. I had become attached\\nto the day.\"\\n\\n\"So that Mrs. Badger has been married to three husbands--two of them\\nhighly distinguished men,\" said Mr. Badger, summing up the facts,\\n\"and each time upon the twenty-first of March at eleven in the\\nforenoon!\"\\n\\nWe all expressed our admiration.\\n\\n\"But for Mr. Badger\\'s modesty,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"I would take\\nleave to correct him and say three distinguished men.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Mr. Jarndyce! What I always tell him!\" observed Mrs.\\nBadger.\\n\\n\"And, my dear,\" said Mr. Badger, \"what do I always tell you? That\\nwithout any affectation of disparaging such professional distinction\\nas I may have attained (which our friend Mr. Carstone will have many\\nopportunities of estimating), I am not so weak--no, really,\" said Mr.\\nBadger to us generally, \"so unreasonable--as to put my reputation on\\nthe same footing with such first-rate men as Captain Swosser and\\nProfessor Dingo. Perhaps you may be interested, Mr. Jarndyce,\"\\ncontinued Mr. Bayham Badger, leading the way into the next\\ndrawing-room, \"in this portrait of Captain Swosser. It was taken on\\nhis return home from the African station, where he had suffered from\\nthe fever of the country. Mrs. Badger considers it too yellow. But\\nit\\'s a very fine head. A very fine head!\"\\n\\nWe all echoed, \"A very fine head!\"\\n\\n\"I feel when I look at it,\" said Mr. Badger, \"\\'That\\'s a man I should\\nlike to have seen!\\' It strikingly bespeaks the first-class man that\\nCaptain Swosser pre-eminently was. On the other side, Professor\\nDingo. I knew him well--attended him in his last illness--a speaking\\nlikeness! Over the piano, Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Swosser. Over\\nthe sofa, Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Dingo. Of Mrs. Bayham Badger\\nIN ESSE, I possess the original and have no copy.\"\\n\\nDinner was now announced, and we went downstairs. It was a very\\ngenteel entertainment, very handsomely served. But the captain and\\nthe professor still ran in Mr. Badger\\'s head, and as Ada and I had\\nthe honour of being under his particular care, we had the full\\nbenefit of them.\\n\\n\"Water, Miss Summerson? Allow me! Not in that tumbler, pray. Bring me\\nthe professor\\'s goblet, James!\"\\n\\nAda very much admired some artificial flowers under a glass.\\n\\n\"Astonishing how they keep!\" said Mr. Badger. \"They were presented to\\nMrs. Bayham Badger when she was in the Mediterranean.\"\\n\\nHe invited Mr. Jarndyce to take a glass of claret.\\n\\n\"Not that claret!\" he said. \"Excuse me! This is an occasion, and ON\\nan occasion I produce some very special claret I happen to have.\\n(James, Captain Swosser\\'s wine!) Mr. Jarndyce, this is a wine that\\nwas imported by the captain, we will not say how many years ago. You\\nwill find it very curious. My dear, I shall be happy to take some of\\nthis wine with you. (Captain Swosser\\'s claret to your mistress,\\nJames!) My love, your health!\"\\n\\nAfter dinner, when we ladies retired, we took Mrs. Badger\\'s first and\\nsecond husband with us. Mrs. Badger gave us in the drawing-room a\\nbiographical sketch of the life and services of Captain Swosser\\nbefore his marriage and a more minute account of him dating from the\\ntime when he fell in love with her at a ball on board the Crippler,\\ngiven to the officers of that ship when she lay in Plymouth Harbour.\\n\\n\"The dear old Crippler!\" said Mrs. Badger, shaking her head. \"She was\\na noble vessel. Trim, ship-shape, all a taunto, as Captain Swosser\\nused to say. You must excuse me if I occasionally introduce a\\nnautical expression; I was quite a sailor once. Captain Swosser loved\\nthat craft for my sake. When she was no longer in commission, he\\nfrequently said that if he were rich enough to buy her old hulk, he\\nwould have an inscription let into the timbers of the quarter-deck\\nwhere we stood as partners in the dance to mark the spot where he\\nfell--raked fore and aft (Captain Swosser used to say) by the fire\\nfrom my tops. It was his naval way of mentioning my eyes.\"\\n\\nMrs. Badger shook her head, sighed, and looked in the glass.\\n\\n\"It was a great change from Captain Swosser to Professor Dingo,\" she\\nresumed with a plaintive smile. \"I felt it a good deal at first. Such\\nan entire revolution in my mode of life! But custom, combined with\\nscience--particularly science--inured me to it. Being the professor\\'s\\nsole companion in his botanical excursions, I almost forgot that I\\nhad ever been afloat, and became quite learned. It is singular that\\nthe professor was the antipodes of Captain Swosser and that Mr.\\nBadger is not in the least like either!\"\\n\\nWe then passed into a narrative of the deaths of Captain Swosser and\\nProfessor Dingo, both of whom seem to have had very bad complaints.\\nIn the course of it, Mrs. Badger signified to us that she had never\\nmadly loved but once and that the object of that wild affection,\\nnever to be recalled in its fresh enthusiasm, was Captain Swosser.\\nThe professor was yet dying by inches in the most dismal manner, and\\nMrs. Badger was giving us imitations of his way of saying, with great\\ndifficulty, \"Where is Laura? Let Laura give me my toast and water!\"\\nwhen the entrance of the gentlemen consigned him to the tomb.\\n\\nNow, I observed that evening, as I had observed for some days past,\\nthat Ada and Richard were more than ever attached to each other\\'s\\nsociety, which was but natural, seeing that they were going to be\\nseparated so soon. I was therefore not very much surprised when we\\ngot home, and Ada and I retired upstairs, to find Ada more silent\\nthan usual, though I was not quite prepared for her coming into my\\narms and beginning to speak to me, with her face hidden.\\n\\n\"My darling Esther!\" murmured Ada. \"I have a great secret to tell\\nyou!\"\\n\\nA mighty secret, my pretty one, no doubt!\\n\\n\"What is it, Ada?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Esther, you would never guess!\"\\n\\n\"Shall I try to guess?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh, no! Don\\'t! Pray don\\'t!\" cried Ada, very much startled by the\\nidea of my doing so.\\n\\n\"Now, I wonder who it can be about?\" said I, pretending to consider.\\n\\n\"It\\'s about--\" said Ada in a whisper. \"It\\'s about--my cousin\\nRichard!\"\\n\\n\"Well, my own!\" said I, kissing her bright hair, which was all I\\ncould see. \"And what about him?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Esther, you would never guess!\"\\n\\nIt was so pretty to have her clinging to me in that way, hiding her\\nface, and to know that she was not crying in sorrow but in a little\\nglow of joy, and pride, and hope, that I would not help her just yet.\\n\\n\"He says--I know it\\'s very foolish, we are both so young--but he\\nsays,\" with a burst of tears, \"that he loves me dearly, Esther.\"\\n\\n\"Does he indeed?\" said I. \"I never heard of such a thing! Why, my pet\\nof pets, I could have told you that weeks and weeks ago!\"\\n\\nTo see Ada lift up her flushed face in joyful surprise, and hold me\\nround the neck, and laugh, and cry, and blush, was so pleasant!\\n\\n\"Why, my darling,\" said I, \"what a goose you must take me for! Your\\ncousin Richard has been loving you as plainly as he could for I don\\'t\\nknow how long!\"\\n\\n\"And yet you never said a word about it!\" cried Ada, kissing me.\\n\\n\"No, my love,\" said I. \"I waited to be told.\"\\n\\n\"But now I have told you, you don\\'t think it wrong of me, do you?\"\\nreturned Ada. She might have coaxed me to say no if I had been the\\nhardest-hearted duenna in the world. Not being that yet, I said no\\nvery freely.\\n\\n\"And now,\" said I, \"I know the worst of it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s not quite the worst of it, Esther dear!\" cried Ada,\\nholding me tighter and laying down her face again upon my breast.\\n\\n\"No?\" said I. \"Not even that?\"\\n\\n\"No, not even that!\" said Ada, shaking her head.\\n\\n\"Why, you never mean to say--\" I was beginning in joke.\\n\\nBut Ada, looking up and smiling through her tears, cried, \"Yes, I do!\\nYou know, you know I do!\" And then sobbed out, \"With all my heart I\\ndo! With all my whole heart, Esther!\"\\n\\nI told her, laughing, why I had known that, too, just as well as I\\nhad known the other! And we sat before the fire, and I had all the\\ntalking to myself for a little while (though there was not much of\\nit); and Ada was soon quiet and happy.\\n\\n\"Do you think my cousin John knows, dear Dame Durden?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Unless my cousin John is blind, my pet,\" said I, \"I should think my\\ncousin John knows pretty well as much as we know.\"\\n\\n\"We want to speak to him before Richard goes,\" said Ada timidly, \"and\\nwe wanted you to advise us, and to tell him so. Perhaps you wouldn\\'t\\nmind Richard\\'s coming in, Dame Durden?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Richard is outside, is he, my dear?\" said I.\\n\\n\"I am not quite certain,\" returned Ada with a bashful simplicity that\\nwould have won my heart if she had not won it long before, \"but I\\nthink he\\'s waiting at the door.\"\\n\\nThere he was, of course. They brought a chair on either side of me,\\nand put me between them, and really seemed to have fallen in love\\nwith me instead of one another, they were so confiding, and so\\ntrustful, and so fond of me. They went on in their own wild way for a\\nlittle while--I never stopped them; I enjoyed it too much myself--and\\nthen we gradually fell to considering how young they were, and how\\nthere must be a lapse of several years before this early love could\\ncome to anything, and how it could come to happiness only if it were\\nreal and lasting and inspired them with a steady resolution to do\\ntheir duty to each other, with constancy, fortitude, and\\nperseverance, each always for the other\\'s sake. Well! Richard said\\nthat he would work his fingers to the bone for Ada, and Ada said that\\nshe would work her fingers to the bone for Richard, and they called\\nme all sorts of endearing and sensible names, and we sat there,\\nadvising and talking, half the night. Finally, before we parted, I\\ngave them my promise to speak to their cousin John to-morrow.\\n\\nSo, when to-morrow came, I went to my guardian after breakfast, in\\nthe room that was our town-substitute for the growlery, and told him\\nthat I had it in trust to tell him something.\\n\\n\"Well, little woman,\" said he, shutting up his book, \"if you have\\naccepted the trust, there can be no harm in it.\"\\n\\n\"I hope not, guardian,\" said I. \"I can guarantee that there is no\\nsecrecy in it. For it only happened yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"Aye? And what is it, Esther?\"\\n\\n\"Guardian,\" said I, \"you remember the happy night when first we came\\ndown to Bleak House? When Ada was singing in the dark room?\"\\n\\nI wished to call to his remembrance the look he had given me then.\\nUnless I am much mistaken, I saw that I did so.\\n\\n\"Because--\" said I with a little hesitation.\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear!\" said he. \"Don\\'t hurry.\"\\n\\n\"Because,\" said I, \"Ada and Richard have fallen in love. And have\\ntold each other so.\"\\n\\n\"Already!\" cried my guardian, quite astonished.\\n\\n\"Yes!\" said I. \"And to tell you the truth, guardian, I rather\\nexpected it.\"\\n\\n\"The deuce you did!\" said he.\\n\\nHe sat considering for a minute or two, with his smile, at once so\\nhandsome and so kind, upon his changing face, and then requested me\\nto let them know that he wished to see them. When they came, he\\nencircled Ada with one arm in his fatherly way and addressed himself\\nto Richard with a cheerful gravity.\\n\\n\"Rick,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"I am glad to have won your confidence. I\\nhope to preserve it. When I contemplated these relations between us\\nfour which have so brightened my life and so invested it with new\\ninterests and pleasures, I certainly did contemplate, afar off, the\\npossibility of you and your pretty cousin here (don\\'t be shy, Ada,\\ndon\\'t be shy, my dear!) being in a mind to go through life together.\\nI saw, and do see, many reasons to make it desirable. But that was\\nafar off, Rick, afar off!\"\\n\\n\"We look afar off, sir,\" returned Richard.\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"That\\'s rational. Now, hear me, my dears!\\nI might tell you that you don\\'t know your own minds yet, that a\\nthousand things may happen to divert you from one another, that it is\\nwell this chain of flowers you have taken up is very easily broken,\\nor it might become a chain of lead. But I will not do that. Such\\nwisdom will come soon enough, I dare say, if it is to come at all. I\\nwill assume that a few years hence you will be in your hearts to one\\nanother what you are to-day. All I say before speaking to you\\naccording to that assumption is, if you DO change--if you DO come to\\nfind that you are more commonplace cousins to each other as man and\\nwoman than you were as boy and girl (your manhood will excuse me,\\nRick!)--don\\'t be ashamed still to confide in me, for there will be\\nnothing monstrous or uncommon in it. I am only your friend and\\ndistant kinsman. I have no power over you whatever. But I wish and\\nhope to retain your confidence if I do nothing to forfeit it.\"\\n\\n\"I am very sure, sir,\" returned Richard, \"that I speak for Ada too\\nwhen I say that you have the strongest power over us both--rooted in\\nrespect, gratitude, and affection--strengthening every day.\"\\n\\n\"Dear cousin John,\" said Ada, on his shoulder, \"my father\\'s place can\\nnever be empty again. All the love and duty I could ever have\\nrendered to him is transferred to you.\"\\n\\n\"Come!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"Now for our assumption. Now we lift our\\neyes up and look hopefully at the distance! Rick, the world is before\\nyou; and it is most probable that as you enter it, so it will receive\\nyou. Trust in nothing but in Providence and your own efforts. Never\\nseparate the two, like the heathen waggoner. Constancy in love is a\\ngood thing, but it means nothing, and is nothing, without constancy\\nin every kind of effort. If you had the abilities of all the great\\nmen, past and present, you could do nothing well without sincerely\\nmeaning it and setting about it. If you entertain the supposition\\nthat any real success, in great things or in small, ever was or could\\nbe, ever will or can be, wrested from Fortune by fits and starts,\\nleave that wrong idea here or leave your cousin Ada here.\"\\n\\n\"I will leave IT here, sir,\" replied Richard smiling, \"if I brought\\nit here just now (but I hope I did not), and will work my way on to\\nmy cousin Ada in the hopeful distance.\"\\n\\n\"Right!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"If you are not to make her happy, why\\nshould you pursue her?\"\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t make her unhappy--no, not even for her love,\" retorted\\nRichard proudly.\\n\\n\"Well said!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce. \"That\\'s well said! She remains here,\\nin her home with me. Love her, Rick, in your active life, no less\\nthan in her home when you revisit it, and all will go well.\\nOtherwise, all will go ill. That\\'s the end of my preaching. I think\\nyou and Ada had better take a walk.\"\\n\\nAda tenderly embraced him, and Richard heartily shook hands with him,\\nand then the cousins went out of the room, looking back again\\ndirectly, though, to say that they would wait for me.\\n\\nThe door stood open, and we both followed them with our eyes as they\\npassed down the adjoining room, on which the sun was shining, and out\\nat its farther end. Richard with his head bent, and her hand drawn\\nthrough his arm, was talking to her very earnestly; and she looked up\\nin his face, listening, and seemed to see nothing else.

It touched me then to reflect, and it touches me now, more\\nnearly, to remember (having what I have to tell) how they both\\nthought of me, even at that engrossing time. I was a part of all\\ntheir plans, for the present and the future. I was to write Richard\\nonce a week, making my faithful report of Ada, who was to write to\\nhim every alternate day. I was to be informed, under his own hand, of\\nall his labours and successes; I was to observe how resolute and\\npersevering he would be; I was to be Ada\\'s bridesmaid when they were\\nmarried; I was to live with them afterwards; I was to keep all the\\nkeys of their house; I was to be made happy for ever and a day.\\n\\n\"And if the suit SHOULD make us rich, Esther--which it may, you\\nknow!\" said Richard to crown all.\\n\\nA shade crossed Ada\\'s face.\\n\\n\"My dearest Ada,\" asked Richard, \"why not?\"\\n\\n\"It had better declare us poor at once,\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"Oh! I don\\'t know about that,\" returned Richard, \"but at all events,\\nit won\\'t declare anything at once. It hasn\\'t declared anything in\\nheaven knows how many years.\"\\n\\n\"Too true,\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"Yes, but,\" urged Richard, answering what her look suggested rather\\nthan her words, \"the longer it goes on, dear cousin, the nearer it\\nmust be to a settlement one way or other. Now, is not that\\nreasonable?\"\\n\\n\"You know best, Richard. But I am afraid if we trust to it, it will\\nmake us unhappy.\"\\n\\n\"But, my Ada, we are not going to trust to it!\" cried Richard gaily.\\n\"We know it better than to trust to it. We only say that if it SHOULD\\nmake us rich, we have no constitutional objection to being rich. The\\ncourt is, by solemn settlement of law, our grim old guardian, and we\\nare to suppose that what it gives us (when it gives us anything) is\\nour right. It is not necessary to quarrel with our right.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ada, \"but it may be better to forget all about it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well,\" cried Richard, \"then we will forget all about it! We\\nconsign the whole thing to oblivion. Dame Durden puts on her\\napproving face, and it\\'s done!\"\\n\\n\"Dame Durden\\'s approving face,\" said I, looking out of the box in\\nwhich I was packing his books, \"was not very visible when you called\\nit by that name; but it does approve, and she thinks you can\\'t do\\nbetter.\"\\n\\nSo, Richard said there was an end of it, and immediately began, on no\\nother foundation, to build as many castles in the air as would man\\nthe Great Wall of China. He went away in high spirits. Ada and I,\\nprepared to miss him very much, commenced our quieter career.\\n\\nOn our arrival in London, we had called with Mr. Jarndyce at Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s but had not been so fortunate as to find her at home. It\\nappeared that she had gone somewhere to a tea-drinking and had taken\\nMiss Jellyby with her. Besides the tea-drinking, there was to be some\\nconsiderable speech-making and letter-writing on the general merits\\nof the cultivation of coffee, conjointly with natives, at the\\nSettlement of Borrioboola-Gha. All this involved, no doubt,\\nsufficient active exercise of pen and ink to make her daughter\\'s part\\nin the proceedings anything but a holiday.\\n\\nIt being now beyond the time appointed for Mrs. Jellyby\\'s return, we\\ncalled again. She was in town, but not at home, having gone to Mile\\nEnd directly after breakfast on some Borrioboolan business, arising\\nout of a society called the East London Branch Aid Ramification. As I\\nhad not seen Peepy on the occasion of our last call (when he was not\\nto be found anywhere, and when the cook rather thought he must have\\nstrolled away with the dustman\\'s cart), I now inquired for him again.\\nThe oyster shells he had been building a house with were still in the\\npassage, but he was nowhere discoverable, and the cook supposed that\\nhe had \"gone after the sheep.\" When we repeated, with some surprise,\\n\"The sheep?\" she said, Oh, yes, on market days he sometimes followed\\nthem quite out of town and came back in such a state as never was!\\n\\nI was sitting at the window with my guardian on the following\\nmorning, and Ada was busy writing--of course to Richard--when Miss\\nJellyby was announced, and entered, leading the identical Peepy, whom\\nshe had made some endeavours to render presentable by wiping the dirt\\ninto corners of his face and hands and making his hair very wet and\\nthen violently frizzling it with her fingers. Everything the dear\\nchild wore was either too large for him or too small. Among his other\\ncontradictory decorations he had the hat of a bishop and the little\\ngloves of a baby. His boots were, on a small scale, the boots of a\\nploughman, while his legs, so crossed and recrossed with scratches\\nthat they looked like maps, were bare below a very short pair of\\nplaid drawers finished off with two frills of perfectly different\\npatterns. The deficient buttons on his plaid frock had evidently been\\nsupplied from one of Mr. Jellyby\\'s coats, they were so extremely\\nbrazen and so much too large. Most extraordinary specimens of\\nneedlework appeared on several parts of his dress, where it had been\\nhastily mended, and I recognized the same hand on Miss Jellyby\\'s. She\\nwas, however, unaccountably improved in her appearance and looked\\nvery pretty. She was conscious of poor little Peepy being but a\\nfailure after all her trouble, and she showed it as she came in by\\nthe way in which she glanced first at him and then at us.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear me!\" said my guardian. \"Due east!\"\\n\\nAda and I gave her a cordial welcome and presented her to Mr.\\nJarndyce, to whom she said as she sat down, \"Ma\\'s compliments, and\\nshe hopes you\\'ll excuse her, because she\\'s correcting proofs of the\\nplan. She\\'s going to put out five thousand new circulars, and she\\nknows you\\'ll be interested to hear that. I have brought one of them\\nwith me. Ma\\'s compliments.\" With which she presented it sulkily\\nenough.\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said my guardian. \"I am much obliged to Mrs. Jellyby.\\nOh, dear me! This is a very trying wind!\"\\n\\nWe were busy with Peepy, taking off his clerical hat, asking him if\\nhe remembered us, and so on. Peepy retired behind his elbow at first,\\nbut relented at the sight of sponge-cake and allowed me to take him\\non my lap, where he sat munching quietly. Mr. Jarndyce then\\nwithdrawing into the temporary growlery, Miss Jellyby opened a\\nconversation with her usual abruptness.\\n\\n\"We are going on just as bad as ever in Thavies Inn,\" said she. \"I\\nhave no peace of my life. Talk of Africa! I couldn\\'t be worse off if\\nI was a what\\'s-his-name--man and a brother!\"\\n\\nI tried to say something soothing.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s of no use, Miss Summerson,\" exclaimed Miss Jellyby, \"though\\nI thank you for the kind intention all the same. I know how I am\\nused, and I am not to be talked over. YOU wouldn\\'t be talked over if\\nyou were used so. Peepy, go and play at Wild Beasts under the piano!\"\\n\\n\"I shan\\'t!\" said Peepy.\\n\\n\"Very well, you ungrateful, naughty, hard-hearted boy!\" returned Miss\\nJellyby with tears in her eyes. \"I\\'ll never take pains to dress you\\nany more.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I will go, Caddy!\" cried Peepy, who was really a good child and\\nwho was so moved by his sister\\'s vexation that he went at once.\\n\\n\"It seems a little thing to cry about,\" said poor Miss Jellyby\\napologetically, \"but I am quite worn out. I was directing the new\\ncirculars till two this morning. I detest the whole thing so that\\nthat alone makes my head ache till I can\\'t see out of my eyes. And\\nlook at that poor unfortunate child! Was there ever such a fright as\\nhe is!\"\\n\\nPeepy, happily unconscious of the defects in his appearance, sat on\\nthe carpet behind one of the legs of the piano, looking calmly out of\\nhis den at us while he ate his cake.\\n\\n\"I have sent him to the other end of the room,\" observed Miss\\nJellyby, drawing her chair nearer ours, \"because I don\\'t want him to\\nhear the conversation. Those little things are so sharp! I was going\\nto say, we really are going on worse than ever. Pa will be a bankrupt\\nbefore long, and then I hope Ma will be satisfied. There\\'ll he nobody\\nbut Ma to thank for it.\"\\n\\nWe said we hoped Mr. Jellyby\\'s affairs were not in so bad a state as\\nthat.\\n\\n\"It\\'s of no use hoping, though it\\'s very kind of you,\" returned Miss\\nJellyby, shaking her head. \"Pa told me only yesterday morning (and\\ndreadfully unhappy he is) that he couldn\\'t weather the storm. I\\nshould be surprised if he could. When all our tradesmen send into our\\nhouse any stuff they like, and the servants do what they like with\\nit, and I have no time to improve things if I knew how, and Ma don\\'t\\ncare about anything, I should like to make out how Pa is to weather\\nthe storm. I declare if I was Pa, I\\'d run away.\"\\n\\n\"My dear!\" said I, smiling. \"Your papa, no doubt, considers his\\nfamily.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, his family is all very fine, Miss Summerson,\" replied Miss\\nJellyby; \"but what comfort is his family to him? His family is\\nnothing but bills, dirt, waste, noise, tumbles downstairs, confusion,\\nand wretchedness. His scrambling home, from week\\'s end to week\\'s end,\\nis like one great washing-day--only nothing\\'s washed!\"\\n\\nMiss Jellyby tapped her foot upon the floor and wiped her eyes.\\n\\n\"I am sure I pity Pa to that degree,\" she said, \"and am so angry with\\nMa that I can\\'t find words to express myself! However, I am not going\\nto bear it, I am determined. I won\\'t be a slave all my life, and I\\nwon\\'t submit to be proposed to by Mr. Quale. A pretty thing, indeed,\\nto marry a philanthropist. As if I hadn\\'t had enough of THAT!\" said\\npoor Miss Jellyby.\\n\\nI must confess that I could not help feeling rather angry with Mrs.\\nJellyby myself, seeing and hearing this neglected girl and knowing\\nhow much of bitterly satirical truth there was in what she said.\\n\\n\"If it wasn\\'t that we had been intimate when you stopped at our\\nhouse,\" pursued Miss Jellyby, \"I should have been ashamed to come\\nhere to-day, for I know what a figure I must seem to you two. But as\\nit is, I made up my mind to call, especially as I am not likely to\\nsee you again the next time you come to town.\"\\n\\nShe said this with such great significance that Ada and I glanced at\\none another, foreseeing something more.\\n\\n\"No!\" said Miss Jellyby, shaking her head. \"Not at all likely! I know\\nI may trust you two. I am sure you won\\'t betray me. I am engaged.\"\\n\\n\"Without their knowledge at home?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Why, good gracious me, Miss Summerson,\" she returned, justifying\\nherself in a fretful but not angry manner, \"how can it be otherwise?\\nYou know what Ma is--and I needn\\'t make poor Pa more miserable by\\ntelling HIM.\"\\n\\n\"But would it not be adding to his unhappiness to marry without his\\nknowledge or consent, my dear?\" said I.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Miss Jellyby, softening. \"I hope not. I should try to make\\nhim happy and comfortable when he came to see me, and Peepy and the\\nothers should take it in turns to come and stay with me, and they\\nshould have some care taken of them then.\"\\n\\nThere was a good deal of affection in poor Caddy. She softened more\\nand more while saying this and cried so much over the unwonted little\\nhome-picture she had raised in her mind that Peepy, in his cave under\\nthe piano, was touched, and turned himself over on his back with loud\\nlamentations. It was not until I had brought him to kiss his sister,\\nand had restored him to his place on my lap, and had shown him that\\nCaddy was laughing (she laughed expressly for the purpose), that we\\ncould recall his peace of mind; even then it was for some time\\nconditional on his taking us in turns by the chin and smoothing our\\nfaces all over with his hand. At last, as his spirits were not equal\\nto the piano, we put him on a chair to look out of window; and Miss\\nJellyby, holding him by one leg, resumed her confidence.\\n\\n\"It began in your coming to our house,\" she said.\\n\\nWe naturally asked how.\\n\\n\"I felt I was so awkward,\" she replied, \"that I made up my mind to be\\nimproved in that respect at all events and to learn to dance. I told\\nMa I was ashamed of myself, and I must be taught to dance. Ma looked\\nat me in that provoking way of hers as if I wasn\\'t in sight, but I\\nwas quite determined to be taught to dance, and so I went to Mr.\\nTurveydrop\\'s Academy in Newman Street.\"\\n\\n\"And was it there, my dear--\" I began.\\n\\n\"Yes, it was there,\" said Caddy, \"and I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop.\\nThere are two Mr. Turveydrops, father and son. My Mr. Turveydrop is\\nthe son, of course. I only wish I had been better brought up and was\\nlikely to make him a better wife, for I am very fond of him.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry to hear this,\" said I, \"I must confess.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know why you should be sorry,\" she retorted a little\\nanxiously, \"but I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop, whether or no, and he\\nis very fond of me. It\\'s a secret as yet, even on his side, because\\nold Mr. Turveydrop has a share in the connexion and it might break\\nhis heart or give him some other shock if he was told of it abruptly.\\nOld Mr. Turveydrop is a very gentlemanly man indeed--very\\ngentlemanly.\"\\n\\n\"Does his wife know of it?\" asked Ada.\\n\\n\"Old Mr. Turveydrop\\'s wife, Miss Clare?\" returned Miss Jellyby,\\nopening her eyes. \"There\\'s no such person. He is a widower.\"\\n\\nWe were here interrupted by Peepy, whose leg had undergone so much on\\naccount of his sister\\'s unconsciously jerking it like a bell-rope\\nwhenever she was emphatic that the afflicted child now bemoaned his\\nsufferings with a very low-spirited noise. As he appealed to me for\\ncompassion, and as I was only a listener, I undertook to hold him.\\nMiss Jellyby proceeded, after begging Peepy\\'s pardon with a kiss and\\nassuring him that she hadn\\'t meant to do it.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the state of the case,\" said Caddy. \"If I ever blame myself,\\nI still think it\\'s Ma\\'s fault. We are to be married whenever we can,\\nand then I shall go to Pa at the office and write to Ma. It won\\'t\\nmuch agitate Ma; I am only pen and ink to HER. One great comfort is,\"\\nsaid Caddy with a sob, \"that I shall never hear of Africa after I am\\nmarried. Young Mr. Turveydrop hates it for my sake, and if old Mr.\\nTurveydrop knows there is such a place, it\\'s as much as he does.\"\\n\\n\"It was he who was very gentlemanly, I think!\" said I.\\n\\n\"Very gentlemanly indeed,\" said Caddy. \"He is celebrated almost\\neverywhere for his deportment.\"\\n\\n\"Does he teach?\" asked Ada.\\n\\n\"No, he don\\'t teach anything in particular,\" replied Caddy. \"But his\\ndeportment is beautiful.\"\\n\\nCaddy went on to say with considerable hesitation and reluctance that\\nthere was one thing more she wished us to know, and felt we ought to\\nknow, and which she hoped would not offend us. It was that she had\\nimproved her acquaintance with Miss Flite, the little crazy old lady,\\nand that she frequently went there early in the morning and met her\\nlover for a few minutes before breakfast--only for a few minutes. \"I\\ngo there at other times,\" said Caddy, \"but Prince does not come then.\\nYoung Mr. Turveydrop\\'s name is Prince; I wish it wasn\\'t, because it\\nsounds like a dog, but of course he didn\\'t christen himself. Old Mr.\\nTurveydrop had him christened Prince in remembrance of the Prince\\nRegent. Old Mr. Turveydrop adored the Prince Regent on account of his\\ndeportment. I hope you won\\'t think the worse of me for having made\\nthese little appointments at Miss Flite\\'s, where I first went with\\nyou, because I like the poor thing for her own sake and I believe she\\nlikes me. If you could see young Mr. Turveydrop, I am sure you would\\nthink well of him--at least, I am sure you couldn\\'t possibly think\\nany ill of him. I am going there now for my lesson. I couldn\\'t ask\\nyou to go with me, Miss Summerson; but if you would,\" said Caddy, who\\nhad said all this earnestly and tremblingly, \"I should be very\\nglad--very glad.\"\\n\\nIt happened that we had arranged with my guardian to go to Miss\\nFlite\\'s that day. We had told him of our former visit, and our\\naccount had interested him; but something had always happened to\\nprevent our going there again. As I trusted that I might have\\nsufficient influence with Miss Jellyby to prevent her taking any very\\nrash step if I fully accepted the confidence she was so willing to\\nplace in me, poor girl, I proposed that she and I and Peepy should go\\nto the academy and afterwards meet my guardian and Ada at Miss\\nFlite\\'s, whose name I now learnt for the first time. This was on\\ncondition that Miss Jellyby and Peepy should come back with us to\\ndinner. The last article of the agreement being joyfully acceded to\\nby both, we smartened Peepy up a little with the assistance of a few\\npins, some soap and water, and a hair-brush, and went out, bending\\nour steps towards Newman Street, which was very near.\\n\\nI found the academy established in a sufficiently dingy house at the\\ncorner of an archway, with busts in all the staircase windows. In the\\nsame house there were also established, as I gathered from the plates\\non the door, a drawing-master, a coal-merchant (there was, certainly,\\nno room for his coals), and a lithographic artist. On the plate\\nwhich, in size and situation, took precedence of all the rest, I\\nread, MR. TURVEYDROP. The door was open, and the hall was blocked up\\nby a grand piano, a harp, and several other musical instruments in\\ncases, all in progress of removal, and all looking rakish in the\\ndaylight. Miss Jellyby informed me that the academy had been lent,\\nlast night, for a concert.\\n\\nWe went upstairs--it had been quite a fine house once, when it was\\nanybody\\'s business to keep it clean and fresh, and nobody\\'s business\\nto smoke in it all day--and into Mr. Turveydrop\\'s great room, which\\nwas built out into a mews at the back and was lighted by a skylight.\\nIt was a bare, resounding room smelling of stables, with cane forms\\nalong the walls, and the walls ornamented at regular intervals with\\npainted lyres and little cut-glass branches for candles, which seemed\\nto be shedding their old-fashioned drops as other branches might shed\\nautumn leaves. Several young lady pupils, ranging from thirteen or\\nfourteen years of age to two or three and twenty, were assembled; and\\nI was looking among them for their instructor when Caddy, pinching my\\narm, repeated the ceremony of introduction. \"Miss Summerson, Mr.\\nPrince Turveydrop!\"\\n\\nI curtsied to a little blue-eyed fair man of youthful appearance with\\nflaxen hair parted in the middle and curling at the ends all round\\nhis head. He had a little fiddle, which we used to call at school a\\nkit, under his left arm, and its little bow in the same hand. His\\nlittle dancing-shoes were particularly diminutive, and he had a\\nlittle innocent, feminine manner which not only appealed to me in an\\namiable way, but made this singular effect upon me, that I received\\nthe impression that he was like his mother and that his mother had\\nnot been much considered or well used.\\n\\n\"I am very happy to see Miss Jellyby\\'s friend,\" he said, bowing low\\nto me. \"I began to fear,\" with timid tenderness, \"as it was past the\\nusual time, that Miss Jellyby was not coming.\"\\n\\n\"I beg you will have the goodness to attribute that to me, who have\\ndetained her, and to receive my excuses, sir,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear!\" said he.\\n\\n\"And pray,\" I entreated, \"do not allow me to be the cause of any more\\ndelay.\"\\n\\nWith that apology I withdrew to a seat between Peepy (who, being well\\nused to it, had already climbed into a corner place) and an old lady\\nof a censorious countenance whose two nieces were in the class and\\nwho was very indignant with Peepy\\'s boots. Prince Turveydrop then\\ntinkled the strings of his kit with his fingers, and the young ladies\\nstood up to dance. Just then there appeared from a side-door old Mr.\\nTurveydrop, in the full lustre of his deportment.\\n\\nHe was a fat old gentleman with a false complexion, false teeth,\\nfalse whiskers, and a wig. He had a fur collar, and he had a padded\\nbreast to his coat, which only wanted a star or a broad blue ribbon\\nto be complete. He was pinched in, and swelled out, and got up, and\\nstrapped down, as much as he could possibly bear. He had such a\\nneckcloth on (puffing his very eyes out of their natural shape), and\\nhis chin and even his ears so sunk into it, that it seemed as though\\nhe must inevitably double up if it were cast loose. He had under his\\narm a hat of great size and weight, shelving downward from the crown\\nto the brim, and in his hand a pair of white gloves with which he\\nflapped it as he stood poised on one leg in a high-shouldered,\\nround-elbowed state of elegance not to be surpassed. He had a cane,\\nhe had an eye-glass, he had a snuff-box, he had rings, he had\\nwristbands, he had everything but any touch of nature; he was not\\nlike youth, he was not like age, he was not like anything in the\\nworld but a model of deportment.\\n\\n\"Father! A visitor. Miss Jellyby\\'s friend, Miss Summerson.\"\\n\\n\"Distinguished,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"by Miss Summerson\\'s presence.\"\\nAs he bowed to me in that tight state, I almost believe I saw creases\\ncome into the whites of his eyes.\\n\\n\"My father,\" said the son, aside, to me with quite an affecting\\nbelief in him, \"is a celebrated character. My father is greatly\\nadmired.\"\\n\\n\"Go on, Prince! Go on!\" said Mr. Turveydrop, standing with his back\\nto the fire and waving his gloves condescendingly. \"Go on, my son!\"\\n\\nAt this command, or by this gracious permission, the lesson went on.\\nPrince Turveydrop sometimes played the kit, dancing; sometimes played\\nthe piano, standing; sometimes hummed the tune with what little\\nbreath he could spare, while he set a pupil right; always\\nconscientiously moved with the least proficient through every step\\nand every part of the figure; and never rested for an instant. His\\ndistinguished father did nothing whatever but stand before the fire,\\na model of deportment.\\n\\n\"And he never does anything else,\" said the old lady of the\\ncensorious countenance. \"Yet would you believe that it\\'s HIS name on\\nthe door-plate?\"\\n\\n\"His son\\'s name is the same, you know,\" said I.\\n\\n\"He wouldn\\'t let his son have any name if he could take it from him,\"\\nreturned the old lady. \"Look at the son\\'s dress!\" It certainly was\\nplain--threadbare--almost shabby. \"Yet the father must be garnished\\nand tricked out,\" said the old lady, \"because of his deportment. I\\'d\\ndeport him! Transport him would be better!\"\\n\\nI felt curious to know more concerning this person. I asked, \"Does he\\ngive lessons in deportment now?\"\\n\\n\"Now!\" returned the old lady shortly. \"Never did.\"\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s consideration, I suggested that perhaps fencing had\\nbeen his accomplishment.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe he can fence at all, ma\\'am,\" said the old lady.\\n\\nI looked surprised and inquisitive. The old lady, becoming more and\\nmore incensed against the master of deportment as she dwelt upon the\\nsubject, gave me some particulars of his career, with strong\\nassurances that they were mildly stated.\\n\\nHe had married a meek little dancing-mistress, with a tolerable\\nconnexion (having never in his life before done anything but deport\\nhimself), and had worked her to death, or had, at the best, suffered\\nher to work herself to death, to maintain him in those expenses which\\nwere indispensable to his position. At once to exhibit his deportment\\nto the best models and to keep the best models constantly before\\nhimself, he had found it necessary to frequent all public places of\\nfashionable and lounging resort, to be seen at Brighton and elsewhere\\nat fashionable times, and to lead an idle life in the very best\\nclothes. To enable him to do this, the affectionate little\\ndancing-mistress had toiled and laboured and would have toiled and\\nlaboured to that hour if her strength had lasted so long. For the\\nmainspring of the story was that in spite of the man\\'s absorbing\\nselfishness, his wife (overpowered by his deportment) had, to the\\nlast, believed in him and had, on her death-bed, in the most moving\\nterms, confided him to their son as one who had an inextinguishable\\nclaim upon him and whom he could never regard with too much pride and\\ndeference. The son, inheriting his mother\\'s belief, and having the\\ndeportment always before him, had lived and grown in the same faith,\\nand now, at thirty years of age, worked for his father twelve hours a\\nday and looked up to him with veneration on the old imaginary\\npinnacle.\\n\\n\"The airs the fellow gives himself!\" said my informant, shaking her\\nhead at old Mr. Turveydrop with speechless indignation as he drew on\\nhis tight gloves, of course unconscious of the homage she was\\nrendering. \"He fully believes he is one of the aristocracy! And he is\\nso condescending to the son he so egregiously deludes that you might\\nsuppose him the most virtuous of parents. Oh!\" said the old lady,\\napostrophizing him with infinite vehemence. \"I could bite you!\"\\n\\nI could not help being amused, though I heard the old lady out with\\nfeelings of real concern. It was difficult to doubt her with the\\nfather and son before me. What I might have thought of them without\\nthe old lady\\'s account, or what I might have thought of the old\\nlady\\'s account without them, I cannot say. There was a fitness of\\nthings in the whole that carried conviction with it.\\n\\nMy eyes were yet wandering, from young Mr. Turveydrop working so\\nhard, to old Mr. Turveydrop deporting himself so beautifully, when\\nthe latter came ambling up to me and entered into conversation.\\n\\nHe asked me, first of all, whether I conferred a charm and a\\ndistinction on London by residing in it? I did not think it necessary\\nto reply that I was perfectly aware I should not do that, in any\\ncase, but merely told him where I did reside.\\n\\n\"A lady so graceful and accomplished,\" he said, kissing his\\nright glove and afterwards extending it towards the pupils,\\n\"will look leniently on the deficiencies here. We do our best to\\npolish--polish--polish!\"\\n\\nHe sat down beside me, taking some pains to sit on the form, I\\nthought, in imitation of the print of his illustrious model on the\\nsofa. And really he did look very like it.\\n\\n\"To polish--polish--polish!\" he repeated, taking a pinch of snuff and\\ngently fluttering his fingers. \"But we are not, if I may say so to\\none formed to be graceful both by Nature and Art--\" with the\\nhigh-shouldered bow, which it seemed impossible for him to make\\nwithout lifting up his eyebrows and shutting his eyes \"--we are not\\nwhat we used to be in point of deportment.\"\\n\\n\"Are we not, sir?\" said I.\\n\\n\"We have degenerated,\" he returned, shaking his head, which he could\\ndo to a very limited extent in his cravat. \"A levelling age is not\\nfavourable to deportment. It develops vulgarity. Perhaps I speak with\\nsome little partiality. It may not be for me to say that I have been\\ncalled, for some years now, Gentleman Turveydrop, or that his Royal\\nHighness the Prince Regent did me the honour to inquire, on my\\nremoving my hat as he drove out of the Pavilion at Brighton (that\\nfine building), \\'Who is he? Who the devil is he? Why don\\'t I know\\nhim? Why hasn\\'t he thirty thousand a year?\\' But these are little\\nmatters of anecdote--the general property, ma\\'am--still repeated\\noccasionally among the upper classes.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed?\" said I.\\n\\nHe replied with the high-shouldered bow. \"Where what is left among us\\nof deportment,\" he added, \"still lingers. England--alas, my\\ncountry!--has degenerated very much, and is degenerating every day.\\nShe has not many gentlemen left. We are few. I see nothing to succeed\\nus but a race of weavers.\"\\n\\n\"One might hope that the race of gentlemen would be perpetuated\\nhere,\" said I.\\n\\n\"You are very good.\" He smiled with a high-shouldered bow again. \"You\\nflatter me. But, no--no! I have never been able to imbue my poor boy\\nwith that part of his art. Heaven forbid that I should disparage my\\ndear child, but he has--no deportment.\"\\n\\n\"He appears to be an excellent master,\" I observed.\\n\\n\"Understand me, my dear madam, he IS an excellent master. All that\\ncan be acquired, he has acquired. All that can be imparted, he can\\nimpart. But there ARE things--\" He took another pinch of snuff and\\nmade the bow again, as if to add, \"This kind of thing, for instance.\"\\n\\nI glanced towards the centre of the room, where Miss Jellyby\\'s lover,\\nnow engaged with single pupils, was undergoing greater drudgery than\\never.\\n\\n\"My amiable child,\" murmured Mr. Turveydrop, adjusting his cravat.\\n\\n\"Your son is indefatigable,\" said I.\\n\\n\"It is my reward,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"to hear you say so. In some\\nrespects, he treads in the footsteps of his sainted mother. She was a\\ndevoted creature. But wooman, lovely wooman,\" said Mr. Turveydrop\\nwith very disagreeable gallantry, \"what a sex you are!\"\\n\\nI rose and joined Miss Jellyby, who was by this time putting on her\\nbonnet. The time allotted to a lesson having fully elapsed, there was\\na general putting on of bonnets. When Miss Jellyby and the\\nunfortunate Prince found an opportunity to become betrothed I don\\'t\\nknow, but they certainly found none on this occasion to exchange a\\ndozen words.\\n\\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Turveydrop benignly to his son, \"do you know the\\nhour?\"\\n\\n\"No, father.\" The son had no watch. The father had a handsome gold\\none, which he pulled out with an air that was an example to mankind.\\n\\n\"My son,\" said he, \"it\\'s two o\\'clock. Recollect your school at\\nKensington at three.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s time enough for me, father,\" said Prince. \"I can take a\\nmorsel of dinner standing and be off.\"\\n\\n\"My dear boy,\" returned his father, \"you must be very quick. You will\\nfind the cold mutton on the table.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, father. Are YOU off now, father?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear. I suppose,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, shutting his eyes and\\nlifting up his shoulders with modest consciousness, \"that I must show\\nmyself, as usual, about town.\"\\n\\n\"You had better dine out comfortably somewhere,\" said his son.\\n\\n\"My dear child, I intend to. I shall take my little meal, I think, at\\nthe French house, in the Opera Colonnade.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right. Good-bye, father!\" said Prince, shaking hands.\\n\\n\"Good-bye, my son. Bless you!\"\\n\\nMr. Turveydrop said this in quite a pious manner, and it seemed to do\\nhis son good, who, in parting from him, was so pleased with him, so\\ndutiful to him, and so proud of him that I almost felt as if it were\\nan unkindness to the younger man not to be able to believe implicitly\\nin the elder. The few moments that were occupied by Prince in taking\\nleave of us (and particularly of one of us, as I saw, being in the\\nsecret), enhanced my favourable impression of his almost childish\\ncharacter. I felt a liking for him and a compassion for him as he put\\nhis little kit in his pocket--and with it his desire to stay a little\\nwhile with Caddy--and went away good-humouredly to his cold mutton\\nand his school at Kensington, that made me scarcely less irate with\\nhis father than the censorious old lady.\\n\\nThe father opened the room door for us and bowed us out in a manner,\\nI must acknowledge, worthy of his shining original. In the same style\\nhe presently passed us on the other side of the street, on his way to\\nthe aristocratic part of the town, where he was going to show himself\\namong the few other gentlemen left. For some moments, I was so lost\\nin reconsidering what I had heard and seen in Newman Street that I\\nwas quite unable to talk to Caddy or even to fix my attention on what\\nshe said to me, especially when I began to inquire in my mind whether\\nthere were, or ever had been, any other gentlemen, not in the dancing\\nprofession, who lived and founded a reputation entirely on their\\ndeportment. This became so bewildering and suggested the possibility\\nof so many Mr. Turveydrops that I said, \"Esther, you must make up\\nyour mind to abandon this subject altogether and attend to Caddy.\" I\\naccordingly did so, and we chatted all the rest of the way to\\nLincoln\\'s Inn.\\n\\nCaddy told me that her lover\\'s education had been so neglected that\\nit was not always easy to read his notes. She said if he were not so\\nanxious about his spelling and took less pains to make it clear, he\\nwould do better; but he put so many unnecessary letters into short\\nwords that they sometimes quite lost their English appearance. \"He\\ndoes it with the best intention,\" observed Caddy, \"but it hasn\\'t the\\neffect he means, poor fellow!\" Caddy then went on to reason, how\\ncould he be expected to be a scholar when he had passed his whole\\nlife in the dancing-school and had done nothing but teach and fag,\\nfag and teach, morning, noon, and night! And what did it matter? She\\ncould write letters enough for both, as she knew to her cost, and it\\nwas far better for him to be amiable than learned. \"Besides, it\\'s not\\nas if I was an accomplished girl who had any right to give herself\\nairs,\" said Caddy. \"I know little enough, I am sure, thanks to Ma!\\n\\n\"There\\'s another thing I want to tell you, now we are alone,\"\\ncontinued Caddy, \"which I should not have liked to mention unless you\\nhad seen Prince, Miss Summerson. You know what a house ours is. It\\'s\\nof no use my trying to learn anything that it would be useful for\\nPrince\\'s wife to know in OUR house. We live in such a state of muddle\\nthat it\\'s impossible, and I have only been more disheartened whenever\\nI have tried. So I get a little practice with--who do you think? Poor\\nMiss Flite! Early in the morning I help her to tidy her room and\\nclean her birds, and I make her cup of coffee for her (of course she\\ntaught me), and I have learnt to make it so well that Prince says\\nit\\'s the very best coffee he ever tasted, and would quite delight old\\nMr. Turveydrop, who is very particular indeed about his coffee. I can\\nmake little puddings too; and I know how to buy neck of mutton, and\\ntea, and sugar, and butter, and a good many housekeeping things. I am\\nnot clever at my needle, yet,\" said Caddy, glancing at the repairs on\\nPeepy\\'s frock, \"but perhaps I shall improve, and since I have been\\nengaged to Prince and have been doing all this, I have felt\\nbetter-tempered, I hope, and more forgiving to Ma. It rather put me\\nout at first this morning to see you and Miss Clare looking so neat\\nand pretty and to feel ashamed of Peepy and myself too, but on the\\nwhole I hope I am better-tempered than I was and more forgiving to\\nMa.\"\\n\\nThe poor girl, trying so hard, said it from her heart, and touched\\nmine. \"Caddy, my love,\" I replied, \"I begin to have a great affection\\nfor you, and I hope we shall become friends.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, do you?\" cried Caddy. \"How happy that would make me!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Caddy,\" said I, \"let us be friends from this time, and let\\nus often have a chat about these matters and try to find the right\\nway through them.\" Caddy was overjoyed. I said everything I could in\\nmy old-fashioned way to comfort and encourage her, and I would not\\nhave objected to old Mr. Turveydrop that day for any smaller\\nconsideration than a settlement on his daughter-in-law.\\n\\nBy this time we were come to Mr. Krook\\'s, whose private door stood\\nopen. There was a bill, pasted on the door-post, announcing a room to\\nlet on the second floor. It reminded Caddy to tell me as we proceeded\\nupstairs that there had been a sudden death there and an inquest and\\nthat our little friend had been ill of the fright. The door and\\nwindow of the vacant room being open, we looked in. It was the room\\nwith the dark door to which Miss Flite had secretly directed my\\nattention when I was last in the house. A sad and desolate place it\\nwas, a gloomy, sorrowful place that gave me a strange sensation of\\nmournfulness and even dread. \"You look pale,\" said Caddy when we came\\nout, \"and cold!\" I felt as if the room had chilled me.\\n\\nWe had walked slowly while we were talking, and my guardian and Ada\\nwere here before us. We found them in Miss Flite\\'s garret. They were\\nlooking at the birds, while a medical gentleman who was so good as to\\nattend Miss Flite with much solicitude and compassion spoke with her\\ncheerfully by the fire.\\n\\n\"I have finished my professional visit,\" he said, coming forward.\\n\"Miss Flite is much better and may appear in court (as her mind is\\nset upon it) to-morrow. She has been greatly missed there, I\\nunderstand.\"\\n\\nMiss Flite received the compliment with complacency and dropped a\\ngeneral curtsy to us.\\n\\n\"Honoured, indeed,\" said she, \"by another visit from the wards in\\nJarndyce! Ve-ry happy to receive Jarndyce of Bleak House beneath my\\nhumble roof!\" with a special curtsy. \"Fitz-Jarndyce, my dear\"--she\\nhad bestowed that name on Caddy, it appeared, and always called her\\nby it--\"a double welcome!\"\\n\\n\"Has she been very ill?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce of the gentleman whom we\\nhad found in attendance on her. She answered for herself directly,\\nthough he had put the question in a whisper.\\n\\n\"Oh, decidedly unwell! Oh, very unwell indeed,\" she said\\nconfidentially. \"Not pain, you know--trouble. Not bodily so much as\\nnervous, nervous! The truth is,\" in a subdued voice and trembling,\\n\"we have had death here. There was poison in the house. I am very\\nsusceptible to such horrid things. It frightened me. Only Mr.\\nWoodcourt knows how much. My physician, Mr. Woodcourt!\" with\\ngreat stateliness. \"The wards in Jarndyce--Jarndyce of Bleak\\nHouse--Fitz-Jarndyce!\"\\n\\n\"Miss Flite,\" said Mr. Woodcourt in a grave kind of voice, as if he\\nwere appealing to her while speaking to us, and laying his hand\\ngently on her arm, \"Miss Flite describes her illness with her usual\\naccuracy. She was alarmed by an occurrence in the house which might\\nhave alarmed a stronger person, and was made ill by the distress and\\nagitation. She brought me here in the first hurry of the discovery,\\nthough too late for me to be of any use to the unfortunate man. I\\nhave compensated myself for that disappointment by coming here since\\nand being of some small use to her.\"\\n\\n\"The kindest physician in the college,\" whispered Miss Flite to me.\\n\"I expect a judgment. On the day of judgment. And shall then confer\\nestates.\"\\n\\n\"She will be as well in a day or two,\" said Mr. Woodcourt, looking at\\nher with an observant smile, \"as she ever will be. In other words,\\nquite well of course. Have you heard of her good fortune?\"\\n\\n\"Most extraordinary!\" said Miss Flite, smiling brightly. \"You never\\nheard of such a thing, my dear! Every Saturday, Conversation Kenge or\\nGuppy (clerk to Conversation K.) places in my hand a paper of\\nshillings. Shillings. I assure you! Always the same number in the\\npaper. Always one for every day in the week. Now you know, really! So\\nwell-timed, is it not? Ye-es! From whence do these papers come, you\\nsay? That is the great question. Naturally. Shall I tell you what I\\nthink? I think,\" said Miss Flite, drawing herself back with a very\\nshrewd look and shaking her right forefinger in a most significant\\nmanner, \"that the Lord Chancellor, aware of the length of time during\\nwhich the Great Seal has been open (for it has been open a long\\ntime!), forwards them. Until the judgment I expect is given. Now\\nthat\\'s very creditable, you know. To confess in that way that he IS a\\nlittle slow for human life. So delicate! Attending court the other\\nday--I attend it regularly, with my documents--I taxed him with it,\\nand he almost confessed. That is, I smiled at him from my bench, and\\nHE smiled at me from his bench. But it\\'s great good fortune, is it\\nnot? And Fitz-Jarndyce lays the money out for me to great advantage.\\nOh, I assure you to the greatest advantage!\"\\n\\nI congratulated her (as she addressed herself to me) upon this\\nfortunate addition to her income and wished her a long continuance of\\nit. I did not speculate upon the source from which it came or wonder\\nwhose humanity was so considerate. My guardian stood before me,\\ncontemplating the birds, and I had no need to look beyond him.\\n\\n\"And what do you call these little fellows, ma\\'am?\" said he in his\\npleasant voice. \"Have they any names?\"\\n\\n\"I can answer for Miss Flite that they have,\" said I, \"for she\\npromised to tell us what they were. Ada remembers?\"\\n\\nAda remembered very well.\\n\\n\"Did I?\" said Miss Flite. \"Who\\'s that at my door? What are you\\nlistening at my door for, Krook?\"\\n\\nThe old man of the house, pushing it open before him, appeared there\\nwith his fur cap in his hand and his cat at his heels.\\n\\n\"I warn\\'t listening, Miss Flite,\" he said, \"I was going to give a rap\\nwith my knuckles, only you\\'re so quick!\"\\n\\n\"Make your cat go down. Drive her away!\" the old lady angrily\\nexclaimed.\\n\\n\"Bah, bah! There ain\\'t no danger, gentlefolks,\" said Mr. Krook,\\nlooking slowly and sharply from one to another until he had looked at\\nall of us; \"she\\'d never offer at the birds when I was here unless I\\ntold her to it.\"\\n\\n\"You will excuse my landlord,\" said the old lady with a dignified\\nair. \"M, quite M! What do you want, Krook, when I have company?\"\\n\\n\"Hi!\" said the old man. \"You know I am the Chancellor.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\" returned Miss Flite. \"What of that?\"\\n\\n\"For the Chancellor,\" said the old man with a chuckle, \"not to be\\nacquainted with a Jarndyce is queer, ain\\'t it, Miss Flite? Mightn\\'t I\\ntake the liberty? Your servant, sir. I know Jarndyce and Jarndyce\\na\\'most as well as you do, sir. I knowed old Squire Tom, sir. I never\\nto my knowledge see you afore though, not even in court. Yet, I go\\nthere a mortal sight of times in the course of the year, taking one\\nday with another.\"\\n\\n\"I never go there,\" said Mr. Jarndyce (which he never did on any\\nconsideration). \"I would sooner go--somewhere else.\"\\n\\n\"Would you though?\" returned Krook, grinning. \"You\\'re bearing hard\\nupon my noble and learned brother in your meaning, sir, though\\nperhaps it is but nat\\'ral in a Jarndyce. The burnt child, sir! What,\\nyou\\'re looking at my lodger\\'s birds, Mr. Jarndyce?\" The old man had\\ncome by little and little into the room until he now touched my\\nguardian with his elbow and looked close up into his face with his\\nspectacled eyes. \"It\\'s one of her strange ways that she\\'ll never tell\\nthe names of these birds if she can help it, though she named \\'em\\nall.\" This was in a whisper. \"Shall I run \\'em over, Flite?\" he asked\\naloud, winking at us and pointing at her as she turned away,\\naffecting to sweep the grate.\\n\\n\"If you like,\" she answered hurriedly.\\n\\nThe old man, looking up at the cages after another look at us, went\\nthrough the list.\\n\\n\"Hope, Joy, Youth, Peace, Rest, Life, Dust, Ashes, Waste, Want, Ruin,\\nDespair, Madness, Death, Cunning, Folly, Words, Wigs, Rags,\\nSheepskin, Plunder, Precedent, Jargon, Gammon, and Spinach. That\\'s\\nthe whole collection,\" said the old man, \"all cooped up together, by\\nmy noble and learned brother.\"\\n\\n\"This is a bitter wind!\" muttered my guardian.\\n\\n\"When my noble and learned brother gives his judgment, they\\'re to be\\nlet go free,\" said Krook, winking at us again. \"And then,\" he added,\\nwhispering and grinning, \"if that ever was to happen--which it\\nwon\\'t--the birds that have never been caged would kill \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"If ever the wind was in the east,\" said my guardian, pretending to\\nlook out of the window for a weathercock, \"I think it\\'s there\\nto-day!\"\\n\\nWe found it very difficult to get away from the house. It was not\\nMiss Flite who detained us; she was as reasonable a little creature\\nin consulting the convenience of others as there possibly could be.\\nIt was Mr. Krook. He seemed unable to detach himself from Mr.\\nJarndyce. If he had been linked to him, he could hardly have attended\\nhim more closely. He proposed to show us his Court of Chancery and\\nall the strange medley it contained; during the whole of our\\ninspection (prolonged by himself) he kept close to Mr. Jarndyce and\\nsometimes detained him under one pretence or other until we had\\npassed on, as if he were tormented by an inclination to enter upon\\nsome secret subject which he could not make up his mind to approach.\\nI cannot imagine a countenance and manner more singularly expressive\\nof caution and indecision, and a perpetual impulse to do something he\\ncould not resolve to venture on, than Mr. Krook\\'s was that day. His\\nwatchfulness of my guardian was incessant. He rarely removed his eyes\\nfrom his face. If he went on beside him, he observed him with the\\nslyness of an old white fox. If he went before, he looked back. When\\nwe stood still, he got opposite to him, and drawing his hand across\\nand across his open mouth with a curious expression of a sense of\\npower, and turning up his eyes, and lowering his grey eyebrows until\\nthey appeared to be shut, seemed to scan every lineament of his face.\\n\\nAt last, having been (always attended by the cat) all over the house\\nand having seen the whole stock of miscellaneous lumber, which was\\ncertainly curious, we came into the back part of the shop. Here on\\nthe head of an empty barrel stood on end were an ink-bottle, some old\\nstumps of pens, and some dirty playbills; and against the wall were\\npasted several large printed alphabets in several plain hands.\\n\\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked my guardian.\\n\\n\"Trying to learn myself to read and write,\" said Krook.\\n\\n\"And how do you get on?\"\\n\\n\"Slow. Bad,\" returned the old man impatiently. \"It\\'s hard at my time\\nof life.\"\\n\\n\"It would be easier to be taught by some one,\" said my guardian.\\n\\n\"Aye, but they might teach me wrong!\" returned the old man with a\\nwonderfully suspicious flash of his eye. \"I don\\'t know what I may\\nhave lost by not being learned afore. I wouldn\\'t like to lose\\nanything by being learned wrong now.\"\\n\\n\"Wrong?\" said my guardian with his good-humoured smile. \"Who do you\\nsuppose would teach you wrong?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House!\" replied the old man,\\nturning up his spectacles on his forehead and rubbing his hands. \"I\\ndon\\'t suppose as anybody would, but I\\'d rather trust my own self than\\nanother!\"\\n\\nThese answers and his manner were strange enough to cause my guardian\\nto inquire of Mr. Woodcourt, as we all walked across Lincoln\\'s Inn\\ntogether, whether Mr. Krook were really, as his lodger represented\\nhim, deranged. The young surgeon replied, no, he had seen no reason\\nto think so. He was exceedingly distrustful, as ignorance usually\\nwas, and he was always more or less under the influence of raw gin,\\nof which he drank great quantities and of which he and his back-shop,\\nas we might have observed, smelt strongly; but he did not think him\\nmad as yet.\\n\\nOn our way home, I so conciliated Peepy\\'s affections by buying him a\\nwindmill and two flour-sacks that he would suffer nobody else to take\\noff his hat and gloves and would sit nowhere at dinner but at my\\nside. Caddy sat upon the other side of me, next to Ada, to whom we\\nimparted the whole history of the engagement as soon as we got back.\\nWe made much of Caddy, and Peepy too; and Caddy brightened\\nexceedingly; and my guardian was as merry as we were; and we were all\\nvery happy indeed until Caddy went home at night in a hackney-coach,\\nwith Peepy fast asleep, but holding tight to the windmill.\\n\\nI have forgotten to mention--at least I have not mentioned--that Mr.\\nWoodcourt was the same dark young surgeon whom we had met at Mr.\\nBadger\\'s. Or that Mr. Jarndyce invited him to dinner that day. Or\\nthat he came. Or that when they were all gone and I said to Ada,\\n\"Now, my darling, let us have a little talk about Richard!\" Ada\\nlaughed and said--\\n\\nBut I don\\'t think it matters what my darling said. She was always\\nmerry.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile we were in London Mr. Jarndyce was constantly beset by the\\ncrowd of excitable ladies and gentlemen whose proceedings had so much\\nastonished us. Mr. Quale, who presented himself soon after our\\narrival, was in all such excitements. He seemed to project those two\\nshining knobs of temples of his into everything that went on and to\\nbrush his hair farther and farther back, until the very roots were\\nalmost ready to fly out of his head in inappeasable philanthropy. All\\nobjects were alike to him, but he was always particularly ready for\\nanything in the way of a testimonial to any one. His great power\\nseemed to be his power of indiscriminate admiration. He would sit for\\nany length of time, with the utmost enjoyment, bathing his temples in\\nthe light of any order of luminary. Having first seen him perfectly\\nswallowed up in admiration of Mrs. Jellyby, I had supposed her to be\\nthe absorbing object of his devotion. I soon discovered my mistake\\nand found him to be train-bearer and organ-blower to a whole\\nprocession of people.\\n\\nMrs. Pardiggle came one day for a subscription to something, and with\\nher, Mr. Quale. Whatever Mrs. Pardiggle said, Mr. Quale repeated to\\nus; and just as he had drawn Mrs. Jellyby out, he drew Mrs. Pardiggle\\nout. Mrs. Pardiggle wrote a letter of introduction to my guardian in\\nbehalf of her eloquent friend Mr. Gusher. With Mr. Gusher appeared\\nMr. Quale again. Mr. Gusher, being a flabby gentleman with a moist\\nsurface and eyes so much too small for his moon of a face that they\\nseemed to have been originally made for somebody else, was not at\\nfirst sight prepossessing; yet he was scarcely seated before Mr.\\nQuale asked Ada and me, not inaudibly, whether he was not a great\\ncreature--which he certainly was, flabbily speaking, though Mr. Quale\\nmeant in intellectual beauty--and whether we were not struck by his\\nmassive configuration of brow. In short, we heard of a great many\\nmissions of various sorts among this set of people, but nothing\\nrespecting them was half so clear to us as that it was Mr. Quale\\'s\\nmission to be in ecstasies with everybody else\\'s mission and that it\\nwas the most popular mission of all.\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce had fallen into this company in the tenderness of his\\nheart and his earnest desire to do all the good in his power; but\\nthat he felt it to be too often an unsatisfactory company, where\\nbenevolence took spasmodic forms, where charity was assumed as a\\nregular uniform by loud professors and speculators in cheap\\nnotoriety, vehement in profession, restless and vain in action,\\nservile in the last degree of meanness to the great, adulatory of one\\nanother, and intolerable to those who were anxious quietly to help\\nthe weak from failing rather than with a great deal of bluster and\\nself-laudation to raise them up a little way when they were down, he\\nplainly told us. When a testimonial was originated to Mr. Quale by\\nMr. Gusher (who had already got one, originated by Mr. Quale), and\\nwhen Mr. Gusher spoke for an hour and a half on the subject to a\\nmeeting, including two charity schools of small boys and girls, who\\nwere specially reminded of the widow\\'s mite, and requested to come\\nforward with halfpence and be acceptable sacrifices, I think the wind\\nwas in the east for three whole weeks.\\n\\nI mention this because I am coming to Mr. Skimpole again. It seemed\\nto me that his off-hand professions of childishness and carelessness\\nwere a great relief to my guardian, by contrast with such things, and\\nwere the more readily believed in since to find one perfectly\\nundesigning and candid man among many opposites could not fail to\\ngive him pleasure. I should be sorry to imply that Mr. Skimpole\\ndivined this and was politic; I really never understood him well\\nenough to know. What he was to my guardian, he certainly was to the\\nrest of the world.\\n\\nHe had not been very well; and thus, though he lived in London, we\\nhad seen nothing of him until now. He appeared one morning in his\\nusual agreeable way and as full of pleasant spirits as ever.\\n\\nWell, he said, here he was! He had been bilious, but rich men were\\noften bilious, and therefore he had been persuading himself that he\\nwas a man of property. So he was, in a certain point of view--in his\\nexpansive intentions. He had been enriching his medical attendant in\\nthe most lavish manner. He had always doubled, and sometimes\\nquadrupled, his fees. He had said to the doctor, \"Now, my dear\\ndoctor, it is quite a delusion on your part to suppose that you\\nattend me for nothing. I am overwhelming you with money--in my\\nexpansive intentions--if you only knew it!\" And really (he said) he\\nmeant it to that degree that he thought it much the same as doing it.\\nIf he had had those bits of metal or thin paper to which mankind\\nattached so much importance to put in the doctor\\'s hand, he would\\nhave put them in the doctor\\'s hand. Not having them, he substituted\\nthe will for the deed. Very well! If he really meant it--if his will\\nwere genuine and real, which it was--it appeared to him that it was\\nthe same as coin, and cancelled the obligation.\\n\\n\"It may be, partly, because I know nothing of the value of money,\"\\nsaid Mr. Skimpole, \"but I often feel this. It seems so reasonable! My\\nbutcher says to me he wants that little bill. It\\'s a part of the\\npleasant unconscious poetry of the man\\'s nature that he always calls\\nit a \\'little\\' bill--to make the payment appear easy to both of us. I\\nreply to the butcher, \\'My good friend, if you knew it, you are paid.\\nYou haven\\'t had the trouble of coming to ask for the little bill. You\\nare paid. I mean it.\\'\"\\n\\n\"But, suppose,\" said my guardian, laughing, \"he had meant the meat in\\nthe bill, instead of providing it?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Jarndyce,\" he returned, \"you surprise me. You take the\\nbutcher\\'s position. A butcher I once dealt with occupied that very\\nground. Says he, \\'Sir, why did you eat spring lamb at eighteen pence\\na pound?\\' \\'Why did I eat spring lamb at eighteen pence a pound, my\\nhonest friend?\\' said I, naturally amazed by the question. \\'I like\\nspring lamb!\\' This was so far convincing. \\'Well, sir,\\' says he, \\'I\\nwish I had meant the lamb as you mean the money!\\' \\'My good fellow,\\'\\nsaid I, \\'pray let us reason like intellectual beings. How could that\\nbe? It was impossible. You HAD got the lamb, and I have NOT got the\\nmoney. You couldn\\'t really mean the lamb without sending it in,\\nwhereas I can, and do, really mean the money without paying it!\\' He\\nhad not a word. There was an end of the subject.\"\\n\\n\"Did he take no legal proceedings?\" inquired my guardian.\\n\\n\"Yes, he took legal proceedings,\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"But in that he\\nwas influenced by passion, not by reason. Passion reminds me of\\nBoythorn. He writes me that you and the ladies have promised him a\\nshort visit at his bachelor-house in Lincolnshire.\"\\n\\n\"He is a great favourite with my girls,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"and I\\nhave promised for them.\"\\n\\n\"Nature forgot to shade him off, I think,\" observed Mr. Skimpole to\\nAda and me. \"A little too boisterous--like the sea. A little too\\nvehement--like a bull who has made up his mind to consider every\\ncolour scarlet. But I grant a sledge-hammering sort of merit in him!\"\\n\\nI should have been surprised if those two could have thought very\\nhighly of one another, Mr. Boythorn attaching so much importance to\\nmany things and Mr. Skimpole caring so little for anything. Besides\\nwhich, I had noticed Mr. Boythorn more than once on the point of\\nbreaking out into some strong opinion when Mr. Skimpole was referred\\nto. Of course I merely joined Ada in saying that we had been greatly\\npleased with him.\\n\\n\"He has invited me,\" said Mr. Skimpole; \"and if a child may trust\\nhimself in such hands--which the present child is encouraged to do,\\nwith the united tenderness of two angels to guard him--I shall go. He\\nproposes to frank me down and back again. I suppose it will cost\\nmoney? Shillings perhaps? Or pounds? Or something of that sort? By\\nthe by, Coavinses. You remember our friend Coavinses, Miss\\nSummerson?\"\\n\\nHe asked me as the subject arose in his mind, in his graceful,\\nlight-hearted manner and without the least embarrassment.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" said I.\\n\\n\"Coavinses has been arrested by the Great Bailiff,\" said Mr.\\nSkimpole. \"He will never do violence to the sunshine any more.\"\\n\\nIt quite shocked me to hear it, for I had already recalled with\\nanything but a serious association the image of the man sitting on\\nthe sofa that night wiping his head.\\n\\n\"His successor informed me of it yesterday,\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"His\\nsuccessor is in my house now--in possession, I think he calls it. He\\ncame yesterday, on my blue-eyed daughter\\'s birthday. I put it to him,\\n\\'This is unreasonable and inconvenient. If you had a blue-eyed\\ndaughter you wouldn\\'t like ME to come, uninvited, on HER birthday?\\'\\nBut he stayed.\"\\n\\nMr. Skimpole laughed at the pleasant absurdity and lightly touched\\nthe piano by which he was seated.\\n\\n\"And he told me,\" he said, playing little chords where I shall put\\nfull stops, \"The Coavinses had left. Three children. No mother. And\\nthat Coavinses\\' profession. Being unpopular. The rising Coavinses.\\nWere at a considerable disadvantage.\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce got up, rubbing his head, and began to walk about. Mr.\\nSkimpole played the melody of one of Ada\\'s favourite songs. Ada and I\\nboth looked at Mr. Jarndyce, thinking that we knew what was passing\\nin his mind.\\n\\nAfter walking and stopping, and several times leaving off rubbing his\\nhead, and beginning again, my guardian put his hand upon the keys and\\nstopped Mr. Skimpole\\'s playing. \"I don\\'t like this, Skimpole,\" he\\nsaid thoughtfully.\\n\\nMr. Skimpole, who had quite forgotten the subject, looked up\\nsurprised.\\n\\n\"The man was necessary,\" pursued my guardian, walking backward and\\nforward in the very short space between the piano and the end of the\\nroom and rubbing his hair up from the back of his head as if a high\\neast wind had blown it into that form. \"If we make such men necessary\\nby our faults and follies, or by our want of worldly knowledge, or by\\nour misfortunes, we must not revenge ourselves upon them. There was\\nno harm in his trade. He maintained his children. One would like to\\nknow more about this.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Coavinses?\" cried Mr. Skimpole, at length perceiving what he\\nmeant. \"Nothing easier. A walk to Coavinses\\' headquarters, and you\\ncan know what you will.\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce nodded to us, who were only waiting for the signal.\\n\"Come! We will walk that way, my dears. Why not that way as soon as\\nanother!\" We were quickly ready and went out. Mr. Skimpole went with\\nus and quite enjoyed the expedition. It was so new and so refreshing,\\nhe said, for him to want Coavinses instead of Coavinses wanting him!\\n\\nHe took us, first, to Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane, where there was\\na house with barred windows, which he called Coavinses\\' Castle. On\\nour going into the entry and ringing a bell, a very hideous boy came\\nout of a sort of office and looked at us over a spiked wicket.\\n\\n\"Who did you want?\" said the boy, fitting two of the spikes into his\\nchin.\\n\\n\"There was a follower, or an officer, or something, here,\" said Mr.\\nJarndyce, \"who is dead.\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\" said the boy. \"Well?\"\\n\\n\"I want to know his name, if you please?\"\\n\\n\"Name of Neckett,\" said the boy.\\n\\n\"And his address?\"\\n\\n\"Bell Yard,\" said the boy. \"Chandler\\'s shop, left hand side, name of\\nBlinder.\"\\n\\n\"Was he--I don\\'t know how to shape the question--\" murmured my\\nguardian, \"industrious?\"\\n\\n\"Was Neckett?\" said the boy. \"Yes, wery much so. He was never tired\\nof watching. He\\'d set upon a post at a street corner eight or ten\\nhours at a stretch if he undertook to do it.\"\\n\\n\"He might have done worse,\" I heard my guardian soliloquize. \"He\\nmight have undertaken to do it and not done it. Thank you. That\\'s all\\nI want.\"\\n\\nWe left the boy, with his head on one side and his arms on the gate,\\nfondling and sucking the spikes, and went back to Lincoln\\'s Inn,\\nwhere Mr. Skimpole, who had not cared to remain nearer Coavinses,\\nawaited us. Then we all went to Bell Yard, a narrow alley at a very\\nshort distance. We soon found the chandler\\'s shop. In it was a\\ngood-natured-looking old woman with a dropsy, or an asthma, or\\nperhaps both.\\n\\n\"Neckett\\'s children?\" said she in reply to my inquiry. \"Yes, Surely,\\nmiss. Three pair, if you please. Door right opposite the stairs.\" And\\nshe handed me the key across the counter.\\n\\nI glanced at the key and glanced at her, but she took it for granted\\nthat I knew what to do with it. As it could only be intended for the\\nchildren\\'s door, I came out without asking any more questions and led\\nthe way up the dark stairs. We went as quietly as we could, but four\\nof us made some noise on the aged boards, and when we came to the\\nsecond story we found we had disturbed a man who was standing there\\nlooking out of his room.\\n\\n\"Is it Gridley that\\'s wanted?\" he said, fixing his eyes on me with an\\nangry stare.\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" said I; \"I am going higher up.\"\\n\\nHe looked at Ada, and at Mr. Jarndyce, and at Mr. Skimpole, fixing\\nthe same angry stare on each in succession as they passed and\\nfollowed me. Mr. Jarndyce gave him good day. \"Good day!\" he said\\nabruptly and fiercely. He was a tall, sallow man with a careworn head\\non which but little hair remained, a deeply lined face, and prominent\\neyes. He had a combative look and a chafing, irritable manner which,\\nassociated with his figure--still large and powerful, though\\nevidently in its decline--rather alarmed me. He had a pen in his\\nhand, and in the glimpse I caught of his room in passing, I saw that\\nit was covered with a litter of papers.\\n\\nLeaving him standing there, we went up to the top room. I tapped at\\nthe door, and a little shrill voice inside said, \"We are locked in.\\nMrs. Blinder\\'s got the key!\"\\n\\nI applied the key on hearing this and opened the door. In a poor room\\nwith a sloping ceiling and containing very little furniture was a\\nmite of a boy, some five or six years old, nursing and hushing a\\nheavy child of eighteen months. There was no fire, though the weather\\nwas cold; both children were wrapped in some poor shawls and tippets\\nas a substitute. Their clothing was not so warm, however, but that\\ntheir noses looked red and pinched and their small figures shrunken\\nas the boy walked up and down nursing and hushing the child with its\\nhead on his shoulder.\\n\\n\"Who has locked you up here alone?\" we naturally asked.\\n\\n\"Charley,\" said the boy, standing still to gaze at us.\\n\\n\"Is Charley your brother?\"\\n\\n\"No. She\\'s my sister, Charlotte. Father called her Charley.\"\\n\\n\"Are there any more of you besides Charley?\"\\n\\n\"Me,\" said the boy, \"and Emma,\" patting the limp bonnet of the child\\nhe was nursing. \"And Charley.\"\\n\\n\"Where is Charley now?\"\\n\\n\"Out a-washing,\" said the boy, beginning to walk up and down again\\nand taking the nankeen bonnet much too near the bedstead by trying to\\ngaze at us at the same time.\\n\\nWe were looking at one another and at these two children when there\\ncame into the room a very little girl, childish in figure but shrewd\\nand older-looking in the face--pretty-faced too--wearing a womanly\\nsort of bonnet much too large for her and drying her bare arms on a\\nwomanly sort of apron. Her fingers were white and wrinkled with\\nwashing, and the soap-suds were yet smoking which she wiped off her\\narms. But for this, she might have been a child playing at washing\\nand imitating a poor working-woman with a quick observation of the\\ntruth.\\n\\nShe had come running from some place in the neighbourhood and had\\nmade all the haste she could. Consequently, though she was very\\nlight, she was out of breath and could not speak at first, as she\\nstood panting, and wiping her arms, and looking quietly at us.\\n\\n\"Oh, here\\'s Charley!\" said the boy.\\n\\nThe child he was nursing stretched forth its arms and cried out to be\\ntaken by Charley. The little girl took it, in a womanly sort of\\nmanner belonging to the apron and the bonnet, and stood looking at us\\nover the burden that clung to her most affectionately.\\n\\n\"Is it possible,\" whispered my guardian as we put a chair for the\\nlittle creature and got her to sit down with her load, the boy\\nkeeping close to her, holding to her apron, \"that this child works\\nfor the rest? Look at this! For God\\'s sake, look at this!\"\\n\\nIt was a thing to look at. The three children close together, and two\\nof them relying solely on the third, and the third so young and yet\\nwith an air of age and steadiness that sat so strangely on the\\nchildish figure.\\n\\n\"Charley, Charley!\" said my guardian. \"How old are you?\"\\n\\n\"Over thirteen, sir,\" replied the child.\\n\\n\"Oh! What a great age,\" said my guardian. \"What a great age,\\nCharley!\"\\n\\nI cannot describe the tenderness with which he spoke to her, half\\nplayfully yet all the more compassionately and mournfully.\\n\\n\"And do you live alone here with these babies, Charley?\" said my\\nguardian.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" returned the child, looking up into his face with perfect\\nconfidence, \"since father died.\"\\n\\n\"And how do you live, Charley? Oh! Charley,\" said my guardian,\\nturning his face away for a moment, \"how do you live?\"\\n\\n\"Since father died, sir, I\\'ve gone out to work. I\\'m out washing\\nto-day.\"\\n\\n\"God help you, Charley!\" said my guardian. \"You\\'re not tall enough to\\nreach the tub!\"\\n\\n\"In pattens I am, sir,\" she said quickly. \"I\\'ve got a high pair as\\nbelonged to mother.\"\\n\\n\"And when did mother die? Poor mother!\"\\n\\n\"Mother died just after Emma was born,\" said the child, glancing at\\nthe face upon her bosom. \"Then father said I was to be as good a\\nmother to her as I could. And so I tried. And so I worked at home and\\ndid cleaning and nursing and washing for a long time before I began\\nto go out. And that\\'s how I know how; don\\'t you see, sir?\"\\n\\n\"And do you often go out?\"\\n\\n\"As often as I can,\" said Charley, opening her eyes and smiling,\\n\"because of earning sixpences and shillings!\"\\n\\n\"And do you always lock the babies up when you go out?\"\\n\\n\"To keep \\'em safe, sir, don\\'t you see?\" said Charley. \"Mrs. Blinder\\ncomes up now and then, and Mr. Gridley comes up sometimes, and\\nperhaps I can run in sometimes, and they can play you know, and Tom\\nan\\'t afraid of being locked up, are you, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"No-o!\" said Tom stoutly.\\n\\n\"When it comes on dark, the lamps are lighted down in the court, and\\nthey show up here quite bright--almost quite bright. Don\\'t they,\\nTom?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Charley,\" said Tom, \"almost quite bright.\"\\n\\n\"Then he\\'s as good as gold,\" said the little creature--Oh, in such a\\nmotherly, womanly way! \"And when Emma\\'s tired, he puts her to bed.\\nAnd when he\\'s tired he goes to bed himself. And when I come home and\\nlight the candle and has a bit of supper, he sits up again and has it\\nwith me. Don\\'t you, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, Charley!\" said Tom. \"That I do!\" And either in this glimpse\\nof the great pleasure of his life or in gratitude and love for\\nCharley, who was all in all to him, he laid his face among the scanty\\nfolds of her frock and passed from laughing into crying.\\n\\nIt was the first time since our entry that a tear had been shed among\\nthese children. The little orphan girl had spoken of their father and\\ntheir mother as if all that sorrow were subdued by the necessity of\\ntaking courage, and by her childish importance in being able to work,\\nand by her bustling busy way. But now, when Tom cried, although she\\nsat quite tranquil, looking quietly at us, and did not by any\\nmovement disturb a hair of the head of either of her little charges,\\nI saw two silent tears fall down her face.\\n\\nI stood at the window with Ada, pretending to look at the housetops,\\nand the blackened stack of chimneys, and the poor plants, and the\\nbirds in little cages belonging to the neighbours, when I found that\\nMrs. Blinder, from the shop below, had come in (perhaps it had taken\\nher all this time to get upstairs) and was talking to my guardian.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not much to forgive \\'em the rent, sir,\" she said; \"who could\\ntake it from them!\"\\n\\n\"Well, well!\" said my guardian to us two. \"It is enough that the time\\nwill come when this good woman will find that it WAS much, and that\\nforasmuch as she did it unto the least of these--This child,\" he\\nadded after a few moments, \"could she possibly continue this?\"\\n\\n\"Really, sir, I think she might,\" said Mrs. Blinder, getting her\\nheavy breath by painful degrees. \"She\\'s as handy as it\\'s possible to\\nbe. Bless you, sir, the way she tended them two children after the\\nmother died was the talk of the yard! And it was a wonder to see her\\nwith him after he was took ill, it really was! \\'Mrs. Blinder,\\' he\\nsaid to me the very last he spoke--he was lying there--\\'Mrs.\\nBlinder, whatever my calling may have been, I see a angel sitting in\\nthis room last night along with my child, and I trust her to Our\\nFather!\\'\"\\n\\n\"He had no other calling?\" said my guardian.\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" returned Mrs. Blinder, \"he was nothing but a follerers.\\nWhen he first came to lodge here, I didn\\'t know what he was, and I\\nconfess that when I found out I gave him notice. It wasn\\'t liked in\\nthe yard. It wasn\\'t approved by the other lodgers. It is NOT a\\ngenteel calling,\" said Mrs. Blinder, \"and most people do object to\\nit. Mr. Gridley objected to it very strong, and he is a good lodger,\\nthough his temper has been hard tried.\"\\n\\n\"So you gave him notice?\" said my guardian.\\n\\n\"So I gave him notice,\" said Mrs. Blinder. \"But really when the time\\ncame, and I knew no other ill of him, I was in doubts. He was\\npunctual and diligent; he did what he had to do, sir,\" said Mrs.\\nBlinder, unconsciously fixing Mr. Skimpole with her eye, \"and it\\'s\\nsomething in this world even to do that.\"\\n\\n\"So you kept him after all?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I said that if he could arrange with Mr. Gridley, I could\\narrange it with the other lodgers and should not so much mind its\\nbeing liked or disliked in the yard. Mr. Gridley gave his consent\\ngruff--but gave it. He was always gruff with him, but he has been\\nkind to the children since. A person is never known till a person is\\nproved.\"\\n\\n\"Have many people been kind to the children?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Upon the whole, not so bad, sir,\" said Mrs. Blinder; \"but certainly\\nnot so many as would have been if their father\\'s calling had been\\ndifferent. Mr. Coavins gave a guinea, and the follerers made up a\\nlittle purse. Some neighbours in the yard that had always joked and\\ntapped their shoulders when he went by came forward with a little\\nsubscription, and--in general--not so bad. Similarly with Charlotte.\\nSome people won\\'t employ her because she was a follerer\\'s child; some\\npeople that do employ her cast it at her; some make a merit of having\\nher to work for them, with that and all her draw-backs upon her, and\\nperhaps pay her less and put upon her more. But she\\'s patienter than\\nothers would be, and is clever too, and always willing, up to the\\nfull mark of her strength and over. So I should say, in general, not\\nso bad, sir, but might be better.\"\\n\\nMrs. Blinder sat down to give herself a more favourable opportunity\\nof recovering her breath, exhausted anew by so much talking before it\\nwas fully restored. Mr. Jarndyce was turning to speak to us when his\\nattention was attracted by the abrupt entrance into the room of the\\nMr. Gridley who had been mentioned and whom we had seen on our way\\nup.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what you may be doing here, ladies and gentlemen,\" he\\nsaid, as if he resented our presence, \"but you\\'ll excuse my coming\\nin. I don\\'t come in to stare about me. Well, Charley! Well, Tom!\\nWell, little one! How is it with us all to-day?\"\\n\\nHe bent over the group in a caressing way and clearly was regarded as\\na friend by the children, though his face retained its stern\\ncharacter and his manner to us was as rude as it could be. My\\nguardian noticed it and respected it.\\n\\n\"No one, surely, would come here to stare about him,\" he said mildly.\\n\\n\"May be so, sir, may be so,\" returned the other, taking Tom upon his\\nknee and waving him off impatiently. \"I don\\'t want to argue with\\nladies and gentlemen. I have had enough of arguing to last one man\\nhis life.\"\\n\\n\"You have sufficient reason, I dare say,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"for\\nbeing chafed and irritated--\"\\n\\n\"There again!\" exclaimed the man, becoming violently angry. \"I am of\\na quarrelsome temper. I am irascible. I am not polite!\"\\n\\n\"Not very, I think.\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" said Gridley, putting down the child and going up to him as if\\nhe meant to strike him, \"do you know anything of Courts of Equity?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I do, to my sorrow.\"\\n\\n\"To your sorrow?\" said the man, pausing in his wrath, \"if so, I beg\\nyour pardon. I am not polite, I know. I beg your pardon! Sir,\" with\\nrenewed violence, \"I have been dragged for five and twenty years over\\nburning iron, and I have lost the habit of treading upon velvet. Go\\ninto the Court of Chancery yonder and ask what is one of the standing\\njokes that brighten up their business sometimes, and they will tell\\nyou that the best joke they have is the man from Shropshire. I,\" he\\nsaid, beating one hand on the other passionately, \"am the man from\\nShropshire.\"\\n\\n\"I believe I and my family have also had the honour of furnishing\\nsome entertainment in the same grave place,\" said my guardian\\ncomposedly. \"You may have heard my name--Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" said Gridley with a rough sort of salutation, \"you\\nbear your wrongs more quietly than I can bear mine. More than that, I\\ntell you--and I tell this gentleman, and these young ladies, if they\\nare friends of yours--that if I took my wrongs in any other way, I\\nshould be driven mad! It is only by resenting them, and by revenging\\nthem in my mind, and by angrily demanding the justice I never get,\\nthat I am able to keep my wits together. It is only that!\" he said,\\nspeaking in a homely, rustic way and with great vehemence. \"You may\\ntell me that I over-excite myself. I answer that it\\'s in my nature to\\ndo it, under wrong, and I must do it. There\\'s nothing between doing\\nit, and sinking into the smiling state of the poor little mad woman\\nthat haunts the court. If I was once to sit down under it, I should\\nbecome imbecile.\"\\n\\nThe passion and heat in which he was, and the manner in which his\\nface worked, and the violent gestures with which he accompanied what\\nhe said, were most painful to see.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he said, \"consider my case. As true as there is a\\nheaven above us, this is my case. I am one of two brothers. My father\\n(a farmer) made a will and left his farm and stock and so forth to my\\nmother for her life. After my mother\\'s death, all was to come to me\\nexcept a legacy of three hundred pounds that I was then to pay my\\nbrother. My mother died. My brother some time afterwards claimed his\\nlegacy. I and some of my relations said that he had had a part of it\\nalready in board and lodging and some other things. Now mind! That\\nwas the question, and nothing else. No one disputed the will; no one\\ndisputed anything but whether part of that three hundred pounds had\\nbeen already paid or not. To settle that question, my brother filing\\na bill, I was obliged to go into this accursed Chancery; I was forced\\nthere because the law forced me and would let me go nowhere else.\\nSeventeen people were made defendants to that simple suit! It first\\ncame on after two years. It was then stopped for another two years\\nwhile the master (may his head rot off!) inquired whether I was my\\nfather\\'s son, about which there was no dispute at all with any mortal\\ncreature. He then found out that there were not defendants\\nenough--remember, there were only seventeen as yet!--but that we must\\nhave another who had been left out and must begin all over again. The\\ncosts at that time--before the thing was begun!--were three times the\\nlegacy. My brother would have given up the legacy, and joyful, to\\nescape more costs. My whole estate, left to me in that will of my\\nfather\\'s, has gone in costs. The suit, still undecided, has fallen\\ninto rack, and ruin, and despair, with everything else--and here I\\nstand, this day! Now, Mr. Jarndyce, in your suit there are thousands\\nand thousands involved, where in mine there are hundreds. Is mine\\nless hard to bear or is it harder to bear, when my whole living was\\nin it and has been thus shamefully sucked away?\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce said that he condoled with him with all his heart and\\nthat he set up no monopoly himself in being unjustly treated by this\\nmonstrous system.\\n\\n\"There again!\" said Mr. Gridley with no diminution of his rage. \"The\\nsystem! I am told on all hands, it\\'s the system. I mustn\\'t look to\\nindividuals. It\\'s the system. I mustn\\'t go into court and say, \\'My\\nLord, I beg to know this from you--is this right or wrong? Have you\\nthe face to tell me I have received justice and therefore am\\ndismissed?\\' My Lord knows nothing of it. He sits there to administer\\nthe system. I mustn\\'t go to Mr. Tulkinghorn, the solicitor in\\nLincoln\\'s Inn Fields, and say to him when he makes me furious by\\nbeing so cool and satisfied--as they all do, for I know they gain by\\nit while I lose, don\\'t I?--I mustn\\'t say to him, \\'I will have\\nsomething out of some one for my ruin, by fair means or foul!\\' HE is\\nnot responsible. It\\'s the system. But, if I do no violence to any of\\nthem, here--I may! I don\\'t know what may happen if I am carried\\nbeyond myself at last! I will accuse the individual workers of that\\nsystem against me, face to face, before the great eternal bar!\"\\n\\nHis passion was fearful. I could not have believed in such rage\\nwithout seeing it.\\n\\n\"I have done!\" he said, sitting down and wiping his face. \"Mr.\\nJarndyce, I have done! I am violent, I know. I ought to know it. I\\nhave been in prison for contempt of court. I have been in prison for\\nthreatening the solicitor. I have been in this trouble, and that\\ntrouble, and shall be again. I am the man from Shropshire, and I\\nsometimes go beyond amusing them, though they have found it amusing,\\ntoo, to see me committed into custody and brought up in custody and\\nall that. It would be better for me, they tell me, if I restrained\\nmyself. I tell them that if I did restrain myself I should become\\nimbecile. I was a good-enough-tempered man once, I believe. People in\\nmy part of the country say they remember me so, but now I must have\\nthis vent under my sense of injury or nothing could hold my wits\\ntogether. It would be far better for you, Mr. Gridley,\\' the Lord\\nChancellor told me last week, \\'not to waste your time here, and to\\nstay, usefully employed, down in Shropshire.\\' \\'My Lord, my Lord, I\\nknow it would,\\' said I to him, \\'and it would have been far better for\\nme never to have heard the name of your high office, but unhappily\\nfor me, I can\\'t undo the past, and the past drives me here!\\'\\nBesides,\" he added, breaking fiercely out, \"I\\'ll shame them. To the\\nlast, I\\'ll show myself in that court to its shame. If I knew when I\\nwas going to die, and could be carried there, and had a voice to\\nspeak with, I would die there, saying, \\'You have brought me here and\\nsent me from here many and many a time. Now send me out feet\\nforemost!\\'\"\\n\\nHis countenance had, perhaps for years, become so set in its\\ncontentious expression that it did not soften, even now when he was\\nquiet.\\n\\n\"I came to take these babies down to my room for an hour,\" he said,\\ngoing to them again, \"and let them play about. I didn\\'t mean to say\\nall this, but it don\\'t much signify. You\\'re not afraid of me, Tom,\\nare you?\"\\n\\n\"No!\" said Tom. \"You ain\\'t angry with ME.\"\\n\\n\"You are right, my child. You\\'re going back, Charley? Aye? Come then,\\nlittle one!\" He took the youngest child on his arm, where she was\\nwilling enough to be carried. \"I shouldn\\'t wonder if we found a\\nginger-bread soldier downstairs. Let\\'s go and look for him!\"\\n\\nHe made his former rough salutation, which was not deficient in a\\ncertain respect, to Mr. Jarndyce, and bowing slightly to us, went\\ndownstairs to his room.\\n\\nUpon that, Mr. Skimpole began to talk, for the first time since our\\narrival, in his usual gay strain. He said, Well, it was really very\\npleasant to see how things lazily adapted themselves to purposes.\\nHere was this Mr. Gridley, a man of a robust will and surprising\\nenergy--intellectually speaking, a sort of inharmonious\\nblacksmith--and he could easily imagine that there Gridley was, years\\nago, wandering about in life for something to expend his superfluous\\ncombativeness upon--a sort of Young Love among the thorns--when the\\nCourt of Chancery came in his way and accommodated him with the exact\\nthing he wanted. There they were, matched, ever afterwards! Otherwise\\nhe might have been a great general, blowing up all sorts of towns, or\\nhe might have been a great politician, dealing in all sorts of\\nparliamentary rhetoric; but as it was, he and the Court of Chancery\\nhad fallen upon each other in the pleasantest way, and nobody was\\nmuch the worse, and Gridley was, so to speak, from that hour provided\\nfor. Then look at Coavinses! How delightfully poor Coavinses (father\\nof these charming children) illustrated the same principle! He, Mr.\\nSkimpole, himself, had sometimes repined at the existence of\\nCoavinses. He had found Coavinses in his way. He could had dispensed\\nwith Coavinses. There had been times when, if he had been a sultan,\\nand his grand vizier had said one morning, \"What does the Commander\\nof the Faithful require at the hands of his slave?\" he might have\\neven gone so far as to reply, \"The head of Coavinses!\" But what\\nturned out to be the case? That, all that time, he had been giving\\nemployment to a most deserving man, that he had been a benefactor to\\nCoavinses, that he had actually been enabling Coavinses to bring up\\nthese charming children in this agreeable way, developing these\\nsocial virtues! Insomuch that his heart had just now swelled and the\\ntears had come into his eyes when he had looked round the room and\\nthought, \"I was the great patron of Coavinses, and his little\\ncomforts were MY work!\"\\n\\nThere was something so captivating in his light way of touching these\\nfantastic strings, and he was such a mirthful child by the side of\\nthe graver childhood we had seen, that he made my guardian smile even\\nas he turned towards us from a little private talk with Mrs. Blinder.\\nWe kissed Charley, and took her downstairs with us, and stopped\\noutside the house to see her run away to her work. I don\\'t know where\\nshe was going, but we saw her run, such a little, little creature in\\nher womanly bonnet and apron, through a covered way at the bottom of\\nthe court and melt into the city\\'s strife and sound like a dewdrop in\\nan ocean.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy Lady Dedlock is restless, very restless. The astonished\\nfashionable intelligence hardly knows where to have her. To-day she\\nis at Chesney Wold; yesterday she was at her house in town; to-morrow\\nshe may be abroad, for anything the fashionable intelligence can with\\nconfidence predict. Even Sir Leicester\\'s gallantry has some trouble\\nto keep pace with her. It would have more but that his other faithful\\nally, for better and for worse--the gout--darts into the old oak\\nbed-chamber at Chesney Wold and grips him by both legs.\\n\\nSir Leicester receives the gout as a troublesome demon, but still a\\ndemon of the patrician order. All the Dedlocks, in the direct male\\nline, through a course of time during and beyond which the memory of\\nman goeth not to the contrary, have had the gout. It can be proved,\\nsir. Other men\\'s fathers may have died of the rheumatism or may have\\ntaken base contagion from the tainted blood of the sick vulgar, but\\nthe Dedlock family have communicated something exclusive even to the\\nlevelling process of dying by dying of their own family gout. It has\\ncome down through the illustrious line like the plate, or the\\npictures, or the place in Lincolnshire. It is among their dignities.\\nSir Leicester is perhaps not wholly without an impression, though he\\nhas never resolved it into words, that the angel of death in the\\ndischarge of his necessary duties may observe to the shades of the\\naristocracy, \"My lords and gentlemen, I have the honour to present to\\nyou another Dedlock certified to have arrived per the family gout.\"\\n\\nHence Sir Leicester yields up his family legs to the family disorder\\nas if he held his name and fortune on that feudal tenure. He feels\\nthat for a Dedlock to be laid upon his back and spasmodically\\ntwitched and stabbed in his extremities is a liberty taken somewhere,\\nbut he thinks, \"We have all yielded to this; it belongs to us; it has\\nfor some hundreds of years been understood that we are not to make\\nthe vaults in the park interesting on more ignoble terms; and I\\nsubmit myself to the compromise.\"\\n\\nAnd a goodly show he makes, lying in a flush of crimson and gold in\\nthe midst of the great drawing-room before his favourite picture of\\nmy Lady, with broad strips of sunlight shining in, down the long\\nperspective, through the long line of windows, and alternating with\\nsoft reliefs of shadow. Outside, the stately oaks, rooted for ages in\\nthe green ground which has never known ploughshare, but was still a\\nchase when kings rode to battle with sword and shield and rode\\na-hunting with bow and arrow, bear witness to his greatness. Inside,\\nhis forefathers, looking on him from the walls, say, \"Each of us was\\na passing reality here and left this coloured shadow of himself and\\nmelted into remembrance as dreamy as the distant voices of the rooks\\nnow lulling you to rest,\" and hear their testimony to his greatness\\ntoo. And he is very great this day. And woe to Boythorn or other\\ndaring wight who shall presumptuously contest an inch with him!\\n\\nMy Lady is at present represented, near Sir Leicester, by her\\nportrait. She has flitted away to town, with no intention of\\nremaining there, and will soon flit hither again, to the confusion of\\nthe fashionable intelligence. The house in town is not prepared for\\nher reception. It is muffled and dreary. Only one Mercury in powder\\ngapes disconsolate at the hall-window; and he mentioned last night to\\nanother Mercury of his acquaintance, also accustomed to good society,\\nthat if that sort of thing was to last--which it couldn\\'t, for a man\\nof his spirits couldn\\'t bear it, and a man of his figure couldn\\'t be\\nexpected to bear it--there would be no resource for him, upon his\\nhonour, but to cut his throat!\\n\\nWhat connexion can there be between the place in Lincolnshire, the\\nhouse in town, the Mercury in powder, and the whereabout of Jo the\\noutlaw with the broom, who had that distant ray of light upon him\\nwhen he swept the churchyard-step? What connexion can there have been\\nbetween many people in the innumerable histories of this world who\\nfrom opposite sides of great gulfs have, nevertheless, been very\\ncuriously brought together!\\n\\nJo sweeps his crossing all day long, unconscious of the link, if any\\nlink there be. He sums up his mental condition when asked a question\\nby replying that he \"don\\'t know nothink.\" He knows that it\\'s hard to\\nkeep the mud off the crossing in dirty weather, and harder still to\\nlive by doing it. Nobody taught him even that much; he found it out.\\n\\nJo lives--that is to say, Jo has not yet died--in a ruinous place\\nknown to the like of him by the name of Tom-all-Alone\\'s. It is a\\nblack, dilapidated street, avoided by all decent people, where the\\ncrazy houses were seized upon, when their decay was far advanced, by\\nsome bold vagrants who after establishing their own possession took\\nto letting them out in lodgings. Now, these tumbling tenements\\ncontain, by night, a swarm of misery. As on the ruined human wretch\\nvermin parasites appear, so these ruined shelters have bred a crowd\\nof foul existence that crawls in and out of gaps in walls and boards;\\nand coils itself to sleep, in maggot numbers, where the rain drips\\nin; and comes and goes, fetching and carrying fever and sowing more\\nevil in its every footprint than Lord Coodle, and Sir Thomas Doodle,\\nand the Duke of Foodle, and all the fine gentlemen in office, down to\\nZoodle, shall set right in five hundred years--though born expressly\\nto do it.\\n\\nTwice lately there has been a crash and a cloud of dust, like the\\nspringing of a mine, in Tom-all-Alone\\'s; and each time a house has\\nfallen. These accidents have made a paragraph in the newspapers and\\nhave filled a bed or two in the nearest hospital. The gaps remain,\\nand there are not unpopular lodgings among the rubbish. As several\\nmore houses are nearly ready to go, the next crash in Tom-all-Alone\\'s\\nmay be expected to be a good one.\\n\\nThis desirable property is in Chancery, of course. It would be an\\ninsult to the discernment of any man with half an eye to tell him so.\\nWhether \"Tom\" is the popular representative of the original plaintiff\\nor defendant in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, or whether Tom lived here when\\nthe suit had laid the street waste, all alone, until other settlers\\ncame to join him, or whether the traditional title is a comprehensive\\nname for a retreat cut off from honest company and put out of the\\npale of hope, perhaps nobody knows. Certainly Jo don\\'t know.\\n\\n\"For I don\\'t,\" says Jo, \"I don\\'t know nothink.\"\\n\\nIt must be a strange state to be like Jo! To shuffle through the\\nstreets, unfamiliar with the shapes, and in utter darkness as to the\\nmeaning, of those mysterious symbols, so abundant over the shops, and\\nat the corners of streets, and on the doors, and in the windows! To\\nsee people read, and to see people write, and to see the postmen\\ndeliver letters, and not to have the least idea of all that\\nlanguage--to be, to every scrap of it, stone blind and dumb! It must\\nbe very puzzling to see the good company going to the churches on\\nSundays, with their books in their hands, and to think (for perhaps\\nJo DOES think at odd times) what does it all mean, and if it means\\nanything to anybody, how comes it that it means nothing to me? To be\\nhustled, and jostled, and moved on; and really to feel that it would\\nappear to be perfectly true that I have no business here, or there,\\nor anywhere; and yet to be perplexed by the consideration that I AM\\nhere somehow, too, and everybody overlooked me until I became the\\ncreature that I am! It must be a strange state, not merely to be told\\nthat I am scarcely human (as in the case of my offering myself for a\\nwitness), but to feel it of my own knowledge all my life! To see the\\nhorses, dogs, and cattle go by me and to know that in ignorance I\\nbelong to them and not to the superior beings in my shape, whose\\ndelicacy I offend! Jo\\'s ideas of a criminal trial, or a judge, or a\\nbishop, or a government, or that inestimable jewel to him (if he only\\nknew it) the Constitution, should be strange! His whole material and\\nimmaterial life is wonderfully strange; his death, the strangest\\nthing of all.\\n\\nJo comes out of Tom-all-Alone\\'s, meeting the tardy morning which is\\nalways late in getting down there, and munches his dirty bit of bread\\nas he comes along. His way lying through many streets, and the houses\\nnot yet being open, he sits down to breakfast on the door-step of the\\nSociety for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and gives\\nit a brush when he has finished as an acknowledgment of the\\naccommodation. He admires the size of the edifice and wonders what\\nit\\'s all about. He has no idea, poor wretch, of the spiritual\\ndestitution of a coral reef in the Pacific or what it costs to look\\nup the precious souls among the coco-nuts and bread-fruit.\\n\\nHe goes to his crossing and begins to lay it out for the day. The\\ntown awakes; the great tee-totum is set up for its daily spin and\\nwhirl; all that unaccountable reading and writing, which has been\\nsuspended for a few hours, recommences. Jo and the other lower\\nanimals get on in the unintelligible mess as they can. It is\\nmarket-day. The blinded oxen, over-goaded, over-driven, never guided,\\nrun into wrong places and are beaten out, and plunge red-eyed and\\nfoaming at stone walls, and often sorely hurt the innocent, and often\\nsorely hurt themselves. Very like Jo and his order; very, very like!\\n\\nA band of music comes and plays. Jo listens to it. So does a dog--a\\ndrover\\'s dog, waiting for his master outside a butcher\\'s shop, and\\nevidently thinking about those sheep he has had upon his mind for\\nsome hours and is happily rid of. He seems perplexed respecting three\\nor four, can\\'t remember where he left them, looks up and down the\\nstreet as half expecting to see them astray, suddenly pricks up his\\nears and remembers all about it. A thoroughly vagabond dog,\\naccustomed to low company and public-houses; a terrific dog to sheep,\\nready at a whistle to scamper over their backs and tear out mouthfuls\\nof their wool; but an educated, improved, developed dog who has been\\ntaught his duties and knows how to discharge them. He and Jo listen\\nto the music, probably with much the same amount of animal\\nsatisfaction; likewise as to awakened association, aspiration, or\\nregret, melancholy or joyful reference to things beyond the senses,\\nthey are probably upon a par. But, otherwise, how far above the human\\nlistener is the brute!\\n\\nTurn that dog\\'s descendants wild, like Jo, and in a very few years\\nthey will so degenerate that they will lose even their bark--but not\\ntheir bite.\\n\\nThe day changes as it wears itself away and becomes dark and drizzly.\\nJo fights it out at his crossing among the mud and wheels, the\\nhorses, whips, and umbrellas, and gets but a scanty sum to pay for\\nthe unsavoury shelter of Tom-all-Alone\\'s. Twilight comes on; gas\\nbegins to start up in the shops; the lamplighter, with his ladder,\\nruns along the margin of the pavement. A wretched evening is\\nbeginning to close in.\\n\\nIn his chambers Mr. Tulkinghorn sits meditating an application to the\\nnearest magistrate to-morrow morning for a warrant. Gridley, a\\ndisappointed suitor, has been here to-day and has been alarming. We\\nare not to be put in bodily fear, and that ill-conditioned fellow\\nshall be held to bail again. From the ceiling, foreshortened\\nAllegory, in the person of one impossible Roman upside down, points\\nwith the arm of Samson (out of joint, and an odd one) obtrusively\\ntoward the window. Why should Mr. Tulkinghorn, for such no reason,\\nlook out of window? Is the hand not always pointing there? So he does\\nnot look out of window.\\n\\nAnd if he did, what would it be to see a woman going by? There are\\nwomen enough in the world, Mr. Tulkinghorn thinks--too many; they are\\nat the bottom of all that goes wrong in it, though, for the matter of\\nthat, they create business for lawyers. What would it be to see a\\nwoman going by, even though she were going secretly? They are all\\nsecret. Mr. Tulkinghorn knows that very well.\\n\\nBut they are not all like the woman who now leaves him and his house\\nbehind, between whose plain dress and her refined manner there is\\nsomething exceedingly inconsistent. She should be an upper servant by\\nher attire, yet in her air and step, though both are hurried and\\nassumed--as far as she can assume in the muddy streets, which she\\ntreads with an unaccustomed foot--she is a lady. Her face is veiled,\\nand still she sufficiently betrays herself to make more than one of\\nthose who pass her look round sharply.\\n\\nShe never turns her head. Lady or servant, she has a purpose in her\\nand can follow it. She never turns her head until she comes to the\\ncrossing where Jo plies with his broom. He crosses with her and begs.\\nStill, she does not turn her head until she has landed on the other\\nside. Then she slightly beckons to him and says, \"Come here!\"\\n\\nJo follows her a pace or two into a quiet court.\\n\\n\"Are you the boy I\\'ve read of in the papers?\" she asked behind her\\nveil.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" says Jo, staring moodily at the veil, \"nothink about\\nno papers. I don\\'t know nothink about nothink at all.\"\\n\\n\"Were you examined at an inquest?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know nothink about no--where I was took by the beadle, do\\nyou mean?\" says Jo. \"Was the boy\\'s name at the inkwhich Jo?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s me!\" says Jo.\\n\\n\"Come farther up.\"\\n\\n\"You mean about the man?\" says Jo, following. \"Him as wos dead?\"\\n\\n\"Hush! Speak in a whisper! Yes. Did he look, when he was living, so\\nvery ill and poor?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, jist!\" says Jo.\\n\\n\"Did he look like--not like YOU?\" says the woman with abhorrence.\\n\\n\"Oh, not so bad as me,\" says Jo. \"I\\'m a reg\\'lar one I am! You didn\\'t\\nknow him, did you?\"\\n\\n\"How dare you ask me if I knew him?\"\\n\\n\"No offence, my lady,\" says Jo with much humility, for even he has\\ngot at the suspicion of her being a lady.\\n\\n\"I am not a lady. I am a servant.\"\\n\\n\"You are a jolly servant!\" says Jo without the least idea of saying\\nanything offensive, merely as a tribute of admiration.\\n\\n\"Listen and be silent. Don\\'t talk to me, and stand farther from me!\\nCan you show me all those places that were spoken of in the account I\\nread? The place he wrote for, the place he died at, the place where\\nyou were taken to, and the place where he was buried? Do you know the\\nplace where he was buried?\"\\n\\nJo answers with a nod, having also nodded as each other place was\\nmentioned.\\n\\n\"Go before me and show me all those dreadful places. Stop opposite to\\neach, and don\\'t speak to me unless I speak to you. Don\\'t look back.\\nDo what I want, and I will pay you well.\"\\n\\nJo attends closely while the words are being spoken; tells them off\\non his broom-handle, finding them rather hard; pauses to consider\\ntheir meaning; considers it satisfactory; and nods his ragged head.\\n\\n\"I\\'m fly,\" says Jo. \"But fen larks, you know. Stow hooking it!\"\\n\\n\"What does the horrible creature mean?\" exclaims the servant,\\nrecoiling from him.\\n\\n\"Stow cutting away, you know!\" says Jo.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand you. Go on before! I will give you more money\\nthan you ever had in your life.\"\\n\\nJo screws up his mouth into a whistle, gives his ragged head a rub,\\ntakes his broom under his arm, and leads the way, passing deftly with\\nhis bare feet over the hard stones and through the mud and mire.\\n\\nCook\\'s Court. Jo stops. A pause.\\n\\n\"Who lives here?\"\\n\\n\"Him wot give him his writing and give me half a bull,\" says Jo in a\\nwhisper without looking over his shoulder.\\n\\n\"Go on to the next.\"\\n\\nKrook\\'s house. Jo stops again. A longer pause.\\n\\n\"Who lives here?\"\\n\\n\"HE lived here,\" Jo answers as before.\\n\\nAfter a silence he is asked, \"In which room?\"\\n\\n\"In the back room up there. You can see the winder from this corner.\\nUp there! That\\'s where I see him stritched out. This is the\\npublic-ouse where I was took to.\"\\n\\n\"Go on to the next!\"\\n\\nIt is a longer walk to the next, but Jo, relieved of his first\\nsuspicions, sticks to the forms imposed upon him and does not look\\nround. By many devious ways, reeking with offence of many kinds, they\\ncome to the little tunnel of a court, and to the gas-lamp (lighted\\nnow), and to the iron gate.\\n\\n\"He was put there,\" says Jo, holding to the bars and looking in.\\n\\n\"Where? Oh, what a scene of horror!\"\\n\\n\"There!\" says Jo, pointing. \"Over yinder. Among them piles of bones,\\nand close to that there kitchin winder! They put him wery nigh the\\ntop. They was obliged to stamp upon it to git it in. I could unkiver\\nit for you with my broom if the gate was open. That\\'s why they locks\\nit, I s\\'pose,\" giving it a shake. \"It\\'s always locked. Look at the\\nrat!\" cries Jo, excited. \"Hi! Look! There he goes! Ho! Into the\\nground!\"\\n\\nThe servant shrinks into a corner, into a corner of that hideous\\narchway, with its deadly stains contaminating her dress; and putting\\nout her two hands and passionately telling him to keep away from her,\\nfor he is loathsome to her, so remains for some moments. Jo stands\\nstaring and is still staring when she recovers herself.\\n\\n\"Is this place of abomination consecrated ground?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know nothink of consequential ground,\" says Jo, still\\nstaring.\\n\\n\"Is it blessed?\"\\n\\n\"Which?\" says Jo, in the last degree amazed.\\n\\n\"Is it blessed?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m blest if I know,\" says Jo, staring more than ever; \"but I\\nshouldn\\'t think it warn\\'t. Blest?\" repeats Jo, something troubled in\\nhis mind. \"It an\\'t done it much good if it is. Blest? I should think\\nit was t\\'othered myself. But I don\\'t know nothink!\"\\n\\nThe servant takes as little heed of what he says as she seems to take\\nof what she has said herself. She draws off her glove to get some\\nmoney from her purse. Jo silently notices how white and small her\\nhand is and what a jolly servant she must be to wear such sparkling\\nrings.\\n\\nShe drops a piece of money in his hand without touching it, and\\nshuddering as their hands approach. \"Now,\" she adds, \"show me the\\nspot again!\"\\n\\nJo thrusts the handle of his broom between the bars of the gate, and\\nwith his utmost power of elaboration, points it out. At length,\\nlooking aside to see if he has made himself intelligible, he finds\\nthat he is alone.\\n\\nHis first proceeding is to hold the piece of money to the gas-light\\nand to be overpowered at finding that it is yellow--gold. His next is\\nto give it a one-sided bite at the edge as a test of its quality.\\nHis next, to put it in his mouth for safety and to sweep the\\nstep and passage with great care. His job done, he sets off for\\nTom-all-Alone\\'s, stopping in the light of innumerable gas-lamps to\\nproduce the piece of gold and give it another one-sided bite as a\\nreassurance of its being genuine.\\n\\nThe Mercury in powder is in no want of society to-night, for my Lady\\ngoes to a grand dinner and three or four balls. Sir Leicester is\\nfidgety down at Chesney Wold, with no better company than the gout;\\nhe complains to Mrs. Rouncewell that the rain makes such a monotonous\\npattering on the terrace that he can\\'t read the paper even by the\\nfireside in his own snug dressing-room.\\n\\n\"Sir Leicester would have done better to try the other side of the\\nhouse, my dear,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell to Rosa. \"His dressing-room is\\non my Lady\\'s side.

We follow the lives of impoverished characters like the young Jo, a homeless crossing sweeper forced to survive on the streets of London. Jo's world is grim and gothic, filled with images of contamination, bones, and rats. His life contrasts starkly with the wealthy upper class, like the fashionable Lady Dedlock, who seem unaware of the suffering around them. The documents also tell of the endless bureaucracy and corruption of the Court of Chancery, which grinds down common people like the orphaned Coavinses children. Acts of charity provide brief rays of light amidst the injustice, but the overall picture is one of a dysfunctional system and uncaring privilege existing side by side with poverty and despair. The gritty descriptions of urban decay are juxtaposed with the obliviousness of the upper class. Together, the excerpts paint a portrait of social inequality and human toll.\"}, {'summary': '\\nCaddy Jellyby has spent the night in Esther and Ada\\'s room, sleeping near Esther in a fit of despair. Before breakfast, she proposes a walk, and all the young people agree. Esther again shows kindness to Peepy, washing him and putting him to sleep in her bed. Esther, Ada, Caddy, and Richard take their first walk about London.\\n\\nThey soon meet Miss Flite again, who begs them to come to her lodgings. They go and visit Krook\\'s rag-and-bottle shop, above which is Miss Flite\\'s room. As they enter, Esther sees a legal handwritten advertisement for Mr. Nemo, requesting work as a law writer (copyist). Neither Esther nor we yet know it, but she is looking at the handwriting of her father and entering the house where he lives.\\n\\nThe group meets Mr. Krook, who is obsessed with Chancery documents. He rambles on about the Jarndyce suit, mentioning the names Barbary, Clare, and Dedlock, giving Esther, unaware, two more names of her mysterious parentage. They see Miss Flite\\'s bare and sad room, and Richard surreptitiously leaves some money for her. They return to the Jellyby house, much affected by the sad states to which Chancery can reduce people.\\n\\nIn Chapter 6, the long awaited meeting with Mr. Jarndyce happens at his home, Bleak House. He is described as a handsome, robust man in his 50s -- exceedingly kindly, genteel, and self-effacing. He has a little quirk of mentioning the \"east wind\" whenever something he doesn\\'t like is brought up. The three young people instantly like and feel affection for their mutual benefactor.\\n\\nA \"perfect child\" is abruptly introduced -- the parasitic poet, Mr. Skimpole. The three young people are instantly brought into his inbroglios when the bailiff, a man called Neckett, arrives and demands payment of a debt. Richard and Esther come to the rescue, and, upon learning of it, Mr. Jarndyce warns them not to give money to Skimpole.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, Esther is given the keys to the household, the mark of the housekeeper of Bleak House. She is excited and honored to have this position. She sets up residence in a room adjoining Ada\\'s, with a sitting room in between, and everything in the house is to the young people\\'s liking.\\n\\nChapter 7 is back in Chesney Wold. Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock have left for Paris. The rain continues, and Mrs. Rouncewell, the aged housekeeper, is introduced. She is instructing a young village girl of considerable beauty in the ways of housekeeping and maid\\'s work in a great house. Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s grandson, Watt, who loves Rosa, is visiting.\\n\\nIn the midst of the rain a couple of visitors come to see the house, but are told it \"isn\\'t the day\". They persist, and are admitted, by using Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s name. Mr. Guppy and his friend are brought through the house, and Mr. Guppy admires a portrait of Lady Dedlock. He exclaims that he must have seen the subject somewhere before. Guppy, who had met Esther Summerson briefly in London at Kenge and Carboy\\'s, is unconsciously remembering Lady Dedlock\\'s resemblence to Esther. Guppy leaves a bit perplexed.\\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell had refused to tell the family ghost story, but now recounts it to her grandson and her charge, Rosa. The Ghost\\'s Walk is a terraced walk outside the house, and an eerie footstep is often heard echoing from it. It is supposed that two hundred years ago, a previous Lady Dedlock had sabotaged horses meant for Cavaliers fighting Cromwellian forces. She had lamed them, and, upon being discovered, was lamed herself by her husband in a struggle. She was limping on the terrace and fell and died, and she vowed to haunt the terrace until \"the pride of the house is tumbled.\" Watt and Rosa can still hear the phantom footsteps. ', 'text': 'Although the morning was raw, and although the fog still seemed\\nheavy--I say seemed, for the windows were so encrusted with dirt that\\nthey would have made midsummer sunshine dim--I was sufficiently\\nforewarned of the discomfort within doors at that early hour and\\nsufficiently curious about London to think it a good idea on the part\\nof Miss Jellyby when she proposed that we should go out for a walk.\\n\\n\"Ma won\\'t be down for ever so long,\" she said, \"and then it\\'s a\\nchance if breakfast\\'s ready for an hour afterwards, they dawdle so.\\nAs to Pa, he gets what he can and goes to the office.

But I\\'m afraid you\\nmust be tired, Miss Summerson, and perhaps you would rather go to\\nbed.\"\\n\\n\"I am not at all tired, my dear,\" said I, \"and would much prefer to\\ngo out.\"\\n\\n\"If you\\'re sure you would,\" returned Miss Jellyby, \"I\\'ll get my\\nthings on.\"\\n\\nAda said she would go too, and was soon astir. I made a proposal to\\nPeepy, in default of being able to do anything better for him, that\\nhe should let me wash him and afterwards lay him down on my bed\\nagain. To this he submitted with the best grace possible, staring at\\nme during the whole operation as if he never had been, and never\\ncould again be, so astonished in his life--looking very miserable\\nalso, certainly, but making no complaint, and going snugly to sleep\\nas soon as it was over. At first I was in two minds about taking such\\na liberty, but I soon reflected that nobody in the house was likely\\nto notice it.\\n\\nWhat with the bustle of dispatching Peepy and the bustle of getting\\nmyself ready and helping Ada, I was soon quite in a glow. We found\\nMiss Jellyby trying to warm herself at the fire in the writing-room,\\nwhich Priscilla was then lighting with a smutty parlour candlestick,\\nthrowing the candle in to make it burn better. Everything was just as\\nwe had left it last night and was evidently intended to remain so.\\nBelow-stairs the dinner-cloth had not been taken away, but had been\\nleft ready for breakfast. Crumbs, dust, and waste-paper were all over\\nthe house. Some pewter pots and a milk-can hung on the area railings;\\nthe door stood open; and we met the cook round the corner coming out\\nof a public-house, wiping her mouth. She mentioned, as she passed us,\\nthat she had been to see what o\\'clock it was.\\n\\nBut before we met the cook, we met Richard, who was dancing up and\\ndown Thavies Inn to warm his feet. He was agreeably surprised to see\\nus stirring so soon and said he would gladly share our walk. So he\\ntook care of Ada, and Miss Jellyby and I went first. I may mention\\nthat Miss Jellyby had relapsed into her sulky manner and that I\\nreally should not have thought she liked me much unless she had told\\nme so.\\n\\n\"Where would you wish to go?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Anywhere, my dear,\" I replied.\\n\\n\"Anywhere\\'s nowhere,\" said Miss Jellyby, stopping perversely.\\n\\n\"Let us go somewhere at any rate,\" said I.\\n\\nShe then walked me on very fast.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care!\" she said. \"Now, you are my witness, Miss Summerson, I\\nsay I don\\'t care--but if he was to come to our house with his great,\\nshining, lumpy forehead night after night till he was as old as\\nMethuselah, I wouldn\\'t have anything to say to him. Such ASSES as he\\nand Ma make of themselves!\"\\n\\n\"My dear!\" I remonstrated, in allusion to the epithet and the\\nvigorous emphasis Miss Jellyby set upon it. \"Your duty as a child--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Don\\'t talk of duty as a child, Miss Summerson; where\\'s Ma\\'s duty\\nas a parent? All made over to the public and Africa, I suppose! Then\\nlet the public and Africa show duty as a child; it\\'s much more their\\naffair than mine. You are shocked, I dare say! Very well, so am I\\nshocked too; so we are both shocked, and there\\'s an end of it!\"\\n\\nShe walked me on faster yet.\\n\\n\"But for all that, I say again, he may come, and come, and come, and\\nI won\\'t have anything to say to him. I can\\'t bear him. If there\\'s any\\nstuff in the world that I hate and detest, it\\'s the stuff he and Ma\\ntalk. I wonder the very paving-stones opposite our house can have the\\npatience to stay there and be a witness of such inconsistencies and\\ncontradictions as all that sounding nonsense, and Ma\\'s management!\"\\n\\nI could not but understand her to refer to Mr. Quale, the young\\ngentleman who had appeared after dinner yesterday. I was saved the\\ndisagreeable necessity of pursuing the subject by Richard and Ada\\ncoming up at a round pace, laughing and asking us if we meant to run\\na race. Thus interrupted, Miss Jellyby became silent and walked\\nmoodily on at my side while I admired the long successions and\\nvarieties of streets, the quantity of people already going to and\\nfro, the number of vehicles passing and repassing, the busy\\npreparations in the setting forth of shop windows and the sweeping\\nout of shops, and the extraordinary creatures in rags secretly\\ngroping among the swept-out rubbish for pins and other refuse.\\n\\n\"So, cousin,\" said the cheerful voice of Richard to Ada behind me.\\n\"We are never to get out of Chancery! We have come by another way to\\nour place of meeting yesterday, and--by the Great Seal, here\\'s the\\nold lady again!\"\\n\\nTruly, there she was, immediately in front of us, curtsying, and\\nsmiling, and saying with her yesterday\\'s air of patronage, \"The wards\\nin Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy, I am sure!\"\\n\\n\"You are out early, ma\\'am,\" said I as she curtsied to me.\\n\\n\"Ye-es! I usually walk here early. Before the court sits. It\\'s\\nretired. I collect my thoughts here for the business of the day,\"\\nsaid the old lady mincingly. \"The business of the day requires a\\ngreat deal of thought. Chancery justice is so ve-ry difficult to\\nfollow.\"\\n\\n\"Who\\'s this, Miss Summerson?\" whispered Miss Jellyby, drawing my arm\\ntighter through her own.\\n\\nThe little old lady\\'s hearing was remarkably quick. She answered for\\nherself directly.\\n\\n\"A suitor, my child. At your service. I have the honour to attend\\ncourt regularly. With my documents. Have I the pleasure of addressing\\nanother of the youthful parties in Jarndyce?\" said the old lady,\\nrecovering herself, with her head on one side, from a very low\\ncurtsy.\\n\\nRichard, anxious to atone for his thoughtlessness of yesterday,\\ngood-naturedly explained that Miss Jellyby was not connected with the\\nsuit.\\n\\n\"Ha!\" said the old lady. \"She does not expect a judgment? She will\\nstill grow old. But not so old. Oh, dear, no! This is the garden of\\nLincoln\\'s Inn. I call it my garden. It is quite a bower in the\\nsummer-time. Where the birds sing melodiously. I pass the greater\\npart of the long vacation here. In contemplation. You find the long\\nvacation exceedingly long, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\nWe said yes, as she seemed to expect us to say so.\\n\\n\"When the leaves are falling from the trees and there are no more\\nflowers in bloom to make up into nosegays for the Lord Chancellor\\'s\\ncourt,\" said the old lady, \"the vacation is fulfilled and the sixth\\nseal, mentioned in the Revelations, again prevails. Pray come and see\\nmy lodging. It will be a good omen for me. Youth, and hope, and\\nbeauty are very seldom there. It is a long, long time since I had a\\nvisit from either.\"\\n\\nShe had taken my hand, and leading me and Miss Jellyby away, beckoned\\nRichard and Ada to come too. I did not know how to excuse myself and\\nlooked to Richard for aid. As he was half amused and half curious and\\nall in doubt how to get rid of the old lady without offence, she\\ncontinued to lead us away, and he and Ada continued to follow, our\\nstrange conductress informing us all the time, with much smiling\\ncondescension, that she lived close by.\\n\\nIt was quite true, as it soon appeared. She lived so close by that we\\nhad not time to have done humouring her for a few moments before she\\nwas at home. Slipping us out at a little side gate, the old lady\\nstopped most unexpectedly in a narrow back street, part of some\\ncourts and lanes immediately outside the wall of the inn, and said,\\n\"This is my lodging. Pray walk up!\"\\n\\nShe had stopped at a shop over which was written KROOK, RAG AND\\nBOTTLE WAREHOUSE. Also, in long thin letters, KROOK, DEALER IN MARINE\\nSTORES. In one part of the window was a picture of a red paper mill\\nat which a cart was unloading a quantity of sacks of old rags. In\\nanother was the inscription BONES BOUGHT. In another, KITCHEN-STUFF\\nBOUGHT. In another, OLD IRON BOUGHT. In another, WASTE-PAPER BOUGHT.\\nIn another, LADIES\\' AND GENTLEMEN\\'S WARDROBES BOUGHT. Everything\\nseemed to be bought and nothing to be sold there. In all parts of the\\nwindow were quantities of dirty bottles--blacking bottles, medicine\\nbottles, ginger-beer and soda-water bottles, pickle bottles, wine\\nbottles, ink bottles; I am reminded by mentioning the latter that the\\nshop had in several little particulars the air of being in a legal\\nneighbourhood and of being, as it were, a dirty hanger-on and\\ndisowned relation of the law. There were a great many ink bottles.\\nThere was a little tottering bench of shabby old volumes outside the\\ndoor, labelled \"Law Books, all at 9d.\" Some of the inscriptions I\\nhave enumerated were written in law-hand, like the papers I had seen\\nin Kenge and Carboy\\'s office and the letters I had so long received\\nfrom the firm. Among them was one, in the same writing, having\\nnothing to do with the business of the shop, but announcing that a\\nrespectable man aged forty-five wanted engrossing or copying to\\nexecute with neatness and dispatch: Address to Nemo, care of Mr.\\nKrook, within. There were several second-hand bags, blue and red,\\nhanging up. A little way within the shop-door lay heaps of old\\ncrackled parchment scrolls and discoloured and dog\\'s-eared\\nlaw-papers. I could have fancied that all the rusty keys, of which\\nthere must have been hundreds huddled together as old iron, had once\\nbelonged to doors of rooms or strong chests in lawyers\\' offices. The\\nlitter of rags tumbled partly into and partly out of a one-legged\\nwooden scale, hanging without any counterpoise from a beam, might\\nhave been counsellors\\' bands and gowns torn up. One had only to\\nfancy, as Richard whispered to Ada and me while we all stood looking\\nin, that yonder bones in a corner, piled together and picked very\\nclean, were the bones of clients, to make the picture complete.\\n\\nAs it was still foggy and dark, and as the shop was blinded besides\\nby the wall of Lincoln\\'s Inn, intercepting the light within a couple\\nof yards, we should not have seen so much but for a lighted lantern\\nthat an old man in spectacles and a hairy cap was carrying about in\\nthe shop. Turning towards the door, he now caught sight of us. He was\\nshort, cadaverous, and withered, with his head sunk sideways between\\nhis shoulders and the breath issuing in visible smoke from his mouth\\nas if he were on fire within. His throat, chin, and eyebrows were so\\nfrosted with white hairs and so gnarled with veins and puckered skin\\nthat he looked from his breast upward like some old root in a fall of\\nsnow.\\n\\n\"Hi, hi!\" said the old man, coming to the door. \"Have you anything to\\nsell?\"\\n\\nWe naturally drew back and glanced at our conductress, who had been\\ntrying to open the house-door with a key she had taken from her\\npocket, and to whom Richard now said that as we had had the pleasure\\nof seeing where she lived, we would leave her, being pressed for\\ntime. But she was not to be so easily left. She became so\\nfantastically and pressingly earnest in her entreaties that we would\\nwalk up and see her apartment for an instant, and was so bent, in her\\nharmless way, on leading me in, as part of the good omen she desired,\\nthat I (whatever the others might do) saw nothing for it but to\\ncomply. I suppose we were all more or less curious; at any rate, when\\nthe old man added his persuasions to hers and said, \"Aye, aye! Please\\nher! It won\\'t take a minute! Come in, come in! Come in through the\\nshop if t\\'other door\\'s out of order!\" we all went in, stimulated by\\nRichard\\'s laughing encouragement and relying on his protection.\\n\\n\"My landlord, Krook,\" said the little old lady, condescending to him\\nfrom her lofty station as she presented him to us. \"He is called\\namong the neighbours the Lord Chancellor. His shop is called the\\nCourt of Chancery. He is a very eccentric person. He is very odd. Oh,\\nI assure you he is very odd!\"\\n\\nShe shook her head a great many times and tapped her forehead with\\nher finger to express to us that we must have the goodness to excuse\\nhim, \"For he is a little--you know--M!\" said the old lady with great\\nstateliness. The old man overheard, and laughed.\\n\\n\"It\\'s true enough,\" he said, going before us with the lantern, \"that\\nthey call me the Lord Chancellor and call my shop Chancery. And why\\ndo you think they call me the Lord Chancellor and my shop Chancery?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, I am sure!\" said Richard rather carelessly.\\n\\n\"You see,\" said the old man, stopping and turning round, \"they--Hi!\\nHere\\'s lovely hair! I have got three sacks of ladies\\' hair below, but\\nnone so beautiful and fine as this. What colour, and what texture!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'ll do, my good friend!\" said Richard, strongly disapproving of\\nhis having drawn one of Ada\\'s tresses through his yellow hand. \"You\\ncan admire as the rest of us do without taking that liberty.\"\\n\\nThe old man darted at him a sudden look which even called my\\nattention from Ada, who, startled and blushing, was so remarkably\\nbeautiful that she seemed to fix the wandering attention of the\\nlittle old lady herself. But as Ada interposed and laughingly said\\nshe could only feel proud of such genuine admiration, Mr. Krook\\nshrunk into his former self as suddenly as he had leaped out of it.\\n\\n\"You see, I have so many things here,\" he resumed, holding up the\\nlantern, \"of so many kinds, and all as the neighbours think (but THEY\\nknow nothing), wasting away and going to rack and ruin, that that\\'s\\nwhy they have given me and my place a christening. And I have so many\\nold parchmentses and papers in my stock. And I have a liking for rust\\nand must and cobwebs. And all\\'s fish that comes to my net. And I\\ncan\\'t abear to part with anything I once lay hold of (or so my\\nneighbours think, but what do THEY know?) or to alter anything, or to\\nhave any sweeping, nor scouring, nor cleaning, nor repairing going on\\nabout me. That\\'s the way I\\'ve got the ill name of Chancery. I don\\'t\\nmind. I go to see my noble and learned brother pretty well every day,\\nwhen he sits in the Inn. He don\\'t notice me, but I notice him.\\nThere\\'s no great odds betwixt us. We both grub on in a muddle. Hi,\\nLady Jane!\"\\n\\nA large grey cat leaped from some neighbouring shelf on his shoulder\\nand startled us all.\\n\\n\"Hi! Show \\'em how you scratch. Hi! Tear, my lady!\" said her master.\\n\\nThe cat leaped down and ripped at a bundle of rags with her tigerish\\nclaws, with a sound that it set my teeth on edge to hear.\\n\\n\"She\\'d do as much for any one I was to set her on,\" said the old man.\\n\"I deal in cat-skins among other general matters, and hers was\\noffered to me. It\\'s a very fine skin, as you may see, but I didn\\'t\\nhave it stripped off! THAT warn\\'t like Chancery practice though, says\\nyou!\"\\n\\nHe had by this time led us across the shop, and now opened a door in\\nthe back part of it, leading to the house-entry. As he stood with his\\nhand upon the lock, the little old lady graciously observed to him\\nbefore passing out, \"That will do, Krook. You mean well, but are\\ntiresome. My young friends are pressed for time. I have none to spare\\nmyself, having to attend court very soon. My young friends are the\\nwards in Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Jarndyce!\" said the old man with a start.\\n\\n\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The great suit, Krook,\" returned his lodger.\\n\\n\"Hi!\" exclaimed the old man in a tone of thoughtful amazement and\\nwith a wider stare than before. \"Think of it!\"\\n\\nHe seemed so rapt all in a moment and looked so curiously at us that\\nRichard said, \"Why, you appear to trouble yourself a good deal about\\nthe causes before your noble and learned brother, the other\\nChancellor!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the old man abstractedly. \"Sure! YOUR name now will be--\"\\n\\n\"Richard Carstone.\"\\n\\n\"Carstone,\" he repeated, slowly checking off that name upon his\\nforefinger; and each of the others he went on to mention upon a\\nseparate finger. \"Yes. There was the name of Barbary, and the name of\\nClare, and the name of Dedlock, too, I think.\"\\n\\n\"He knows as much of the cause as the real salaried Chancellor!\" said\\nRichard, quite astonished, to Ada and me.\\n\\n\"Aye!\" said the old man, coming slowly out of his abstraction. \"Yes!\\nTom Jarndyce--you\\'ll excuse me, being related; but he was never known\\nabout court by any other name, and was as well known there as--she is\\nnow,\" nodding slightly at his lodger. \"Tom Jarndyce was often in\\nhere. He got into a restless habit of strolling about when the cause\\nwas on, or expected, talking to the little shopkeepers and telling\\n\\'em to keep out of Chancery, whatever they did. \\'For,\\' says he, \\'it\\'s\\nbeing ground to bits in a slow mill; it\\'s being roasted at a slow\\nfire; it\\'s being stung to death by single bees; it\\'s being drowned by\\ndrops; it\\'s going mad by grains.\\' He was as near making away with\\nhimself, just where the young lady stands, as near could be.\"\\n\\nWe listened with horror.\\n\\n\"He come in at the door,\" said the old man, slowly pointing an\\nimaginary track along the shop, \"on the day he did it--the whole\\nneighbourhood had said for months before that he would do it, of a\\ncertainty sooner or later--he come in at the door that day, and\\nwalked along there, and sat himself on a bench that stood there, and\\nasked me (you\\'ll judge I was a mortal sight younger then) to fetch\\nhim a pint of wine. \\'For,\\' says he, \\'Krook, I am much depressed; my\\ncause is on again, and I think I\\'m nearer judgment than I ever was.\\'\\nI hadn\\'t a mind to leave him alone; and I persuaded him to go to the\\ntavern over the way there, t\\'other side my lane (I mean Chancery\\nLane); and I followed and looked in at the window, and saw him,\\ncomfortable as I thought, in the arm-chair by the fire, and company\\nwith him. I hadn\\'t hardly got back here when I heard a shot go\\nechoing and rattling right away into the inn. I ran out--neighbours\\nran out--twenty of us cried at once, \\'Tom Jarndyce!\\'\"\\n\\nThe old man stopped, looked hard at us, looked down into the lantern,\\nblew the light out, and shut the lantern up.\\n\\n\"We were right, I needn\\'t tell the present hearers. Hi! To be sure,\\nhow the neighbourhood poured into court that afternoon while the\\ncause was on! How my noble and learned brother, and all the rest of\\n\\'em, grubbed and muddled away as usual and tried to look as if they\\nhadn\\'t heard a word of the last fact in the case or as if they\\nhad--Oh, dear me!--nothing at all to do with it if they had heard of\\nit by any chance!\"\\n\\nAda\\'s colour had entirely left her, and Richard was scarcely less\\npale. Nor could I wonder, judging even from my emotions, and I was no\\nparty in the suit, that to hearts so untried and fresh it was a shock\\nto come into the inheritance of a protracted misery, attended in the\\nminds of many people with such dreadful recollections. I had another\\nuneasiness, in the application of the painful story to the poor\\nhalf-witted creature who had brought us there; but, to my surprise,\\nshe seemed perfectly unconscious of that and only led the way\\nupstairs again, informing us with the toleration of a superior\\ncreature for the infirmities of a common mortal that her landlord was\\n\"a little M, you know!\"\\n\\nShe lived at the top of the house, in a pretty large room, from which\\nshe had a glimpse of Lincoln\\'s Inn Hall. This seemed to have been her\\nprincipal inducement, originally, for taking up her residence there.\\nShe could look at it, she said, in the night, especially in the\\nmoonshine. Her room was clean, but very, very bare. I noticed the\\nscantiest necessaries in the way of furniture; a few old prints from\\nbooks, of Chancellors and barristers, wafered against the wall; and\\nsome half-dozen reticles and work-bags, \"containing documents,\" as\\nshe informed us. There were neither coals nor ashes in the grate, and\\nI saw no articles of clothing anywhere, nor any kind of food. Upon a\\nshelf in an open cupboard were a plate or two, a cup or two, and so\\nforth, but all dry and empty. There was a more affecting meaning in\\nher pinched appearance, I thought as I looked round, than I had\\nunderstood before.\\n\\n\"Extremely honoured, I am sure,\" said our poor hostess with the\\ngreatest suavity, \"by this visit from the wards in Jarndyce. And very\\nmuch indebted for the omen. It is a retired situation. Considering. I\\nam limited as to situation. In consequence of the necessity of\\nattending on the Chancellor. I have lived here many years. I pass my\\ndays in court, my evenings and my nights here. I find the nights\\nlong, for I sleep but little and think much. That is, of course,\\nunavoidable, being in Chancery. I am sorry I cannot offer chocolate.\\nI expect a judgment shortly and shall then place my establishment on\\na superior footing. At present, I don\\'t mind confessing to the wards\\nin Jarndyce (in strict confidence) that I sometimes find it difficult\\nto keep up a genteel appearance. I have felt the cold here. I have\\nfelt something sharper than cold. It matters very little. Pray excuse\\nthe introduction of such mean topics.\"\\n\\nShe partly drew aside the curtain of the long, low garret window and\\ncalled our attention to a number of bird-cages hanging there, some\\ncontaining several birds. There were larks, linnets, and\\ngoldfinches--I should think at least twenty.\\n\\n\"I began to keep the little creatures,\" she said, \"with an object\\nthat the wards will readily comprehend. With the intention of\\nrestoring them to liberty. When my judgment should be given. Ye-es!\\nThey die in prison, though. Their lives, poor silly things, are so\\nshort in comparison with Chancery proceedings that, one by one, the\\nwhole collection has died over and over again. I doubt, do you know,\\nwhether one of these, though they are all young, will live to be\\nfree! Ve-ry mortifying, is it not?\"\\n\\nAlthough she sometimes asked a question, she never seemed to expect a\\nreply, but rambled on as if she were in the habit of doing so when no\\none but herself was present.\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" she pursued, \"I positively doubt sometimes, I do assure\\nyou, whether while matters are still unsettled, and the sixth or\\nGreat Seal still prevails, I may not one day be found lying stark and\\nsenseless here, as I have found so many birds!\"\\n\\nRichard, answering what he saw in Ada\\'s compassionate eyes, took the\\nopportunity of laying some money, softly and unobserved, on the\\nchimney-piece. We all drew nearer to the cages, feigning to examine\\nthe birds.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t allow them to sing much,\" said the little old lady, \"for\\n(you\\'ll think this curious) I find my mind confused by the idea that\\nthey are singing while I am following the arguments in court. And my\\nmind requires to be so very clear, you know! Another time, I\\'ll tell\\nyou their names. Not at present. On a day of such good omen, they\\nshall sing as much as they like. In honour of youth,\" a smile and\\ncurtsy, \"hope,\" a smile and curtsy, \"and beauty,\" a smile and curtsy.\\n\"There! We\\'ll let in the full light.\"\\n\\nThe birds began to stir and chirp.\\n\\n\"I cannot admit the air freely,\" said the little old lady--the room\\nwas close, and would have been the better for it--\"because the cat\\nyou saw downstairs, called Lady Jane, is greedy for their lives. She\\ncrouches on the parapet outside for hours and hours. I have\\ndiscovered,\" whispering mysteriously, \"that her natural cruelty is\\nsharpened by a jealous fear of their regaining their liberty. In\\nconsequence of the judgment I expect being shortly given. She is sly\\nand full of malice. I half believe, sometimes, that she is no cat,\\nbut the wolf of the old saying. It is so very difficult to keep her\\nfrom the door.\"\\n\\nSome neighbouring bells, reminding the poor soul that it was\\nhalf-past nine, did more for us in the way of bringing our visit to\\nan end than we could easily have done for ourselves. She hurriedly\\ntook up her little bag of documents, which she had laid upon the\\ntable on coming in, and asked if we were also going into court. On\\nour answering no, and that we would on no account detain her, she\\nopened the door to attend us downstairs.\\n\\n\"With such an omen, it is even more necessary than usual that I\\nshould be there before the Chancellor comes in,\" said she, \"for he\\nmight mention my case the first thing. I have a presentiment that he\\nWILL mention it the first thing this morning.\"\\n\\nShe stopped to tell us in a whisper as we were going down that the\\nwhole house was filled with strange lumber which her landlord had\\nbought piecemeal and had no wish to sell, in consequence of being a\\nlittle M. This was on the first floor. But she had made a previous\\nstoppage on the second floor and had silently pointed at a dark door\\nthere.\\n\\n\"The only other lodger,\" she now whispered in explanation, \"a\\nlaw-writer. The children in the lanes here say he has sold himself to\\nthe devil. I don\\'t know what he can have done with the money. Hush!\"\\n\\nShe appeared to mistrust that the lodger might hear her even there,\\nand repeating \"Hush!\" went before us on tiptoe as though even the\\nsound of her footsteps might reveal to him what she had said.\\n\\nPassing through the shop on our way out, as we had passed through it\\non our way in, we found the old man storing a quantity of packets of\\nwaste-paper in a kind of well in the floor. He seemed to be working\\nhard, with the perspiration standing on his forehead, and had a piece\\nof chalk by him, with which, as he put each separate package or\\nbundle down, he made a crooked mark on the panelling of the wall.\\n\\nRichard and Ada, and Miss Jellyby, and the little old lady had gone\\nby him, and I was going when he touched me on the arm to stay me, and\\nchalked the letter J upon the wall--in a very curious manner,\\nbeginning with the end of the letter and shaping it backward. It was\\na capital letter, not a printed one, but just such a letter as any\\nclerk in Messrs. Kenge and Carboy\\'s office would have made.\\n\\n\"Can you read it?\" he asked me with a keen glance.\\n\\n\"Surely,\" said I. \"It\\'s very plain.\"\\n\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\\n\"J.\"\\n\\nWith another glance at me, and a glance at the door, he rubbed it out\\nand turned an \"a\" in its place (not a capital letter this time), and\\nsaid, \"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\nI told him. He then rubbed that out and turned the letter \"r,\" and\\nasked me the same question. He went on quickly until he had formed in\\nthe same curious manner, beginning at the ends and bottoms of the\\nletters, the word Jarndyce, without once leaving two letters on the\\nwall together.\\n\\n\"What does that spell?\" he asked me.\\n\\nWhen I told him, he laughed. In the same odd way, yet with the same\\nrapidity, he then produced singly, and rubbed out singly, the letters\\nforming the words Bleak House. These, in some astonishment, I also\\nread; and he laughed again.\\n\\n\"Hi!\" said the old man, laying aside the chalk. \"I have a turn for\\ncopying from memory, you see, miss, though I can neither read nor\\nwrite.\"\\n\\nHe looked so disagreeable and his cat looked so wickedly at me, as if\\nI were a blood-relation of the birds upstairs, that I was quite\\nrelieved by Richard\\'s appearing at the door and saying, \"Miss\\nSummerson, I hope you are not bargaining for the sale of your hair.\\nDon\\'t be tempted. Three sacks below are quite enough for Mr. Krook!\"\\n\\nI lost no time in wishing Mr. Krook good morning and joining my\\nfriends outside, where we parted with the little old lady, who gave\\nus her blessing with great ceremony and renewed her assurance of\\nyesterday in reference to her intention of settling estates on Ada\\nand me. Before we finally turned out of those lanes, we looked back\\nand saw Mr. Krook standing at his shop-door, in his spectacles,\\nlooking after us, with his cat upon his shoulder, and her tail\\nsticking up on one side of his hairy cap like a tall feather.\\n\\n\"Quite an adventure for a morning in London!\" said Richard with a\\nsigh. \"Ah, cousin, cousin, it\\'s a weary word this Chancery!\"\\n\\n\"It is to me, and has been ever since I can remember,\" returned Ada.\\n\"I am grieved that I should be the enemy--as I suppose I am--of a\\ngreat number of relations and others, and that they should be my\\nenemies--as I suppose they are--and that we should all be ruining one\\nanother without knowing how or why and be in constant doubt and\\ndiscord all our lives. It seems very strange, as there must be right\\nsomewhere, that an honest judge in real earnest has not been able to\\nfind out through all these years where it is.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, cousin!\" said Richard. \"Strange, indeed! All this wasteful,\\nwanton chess-playing IS very strange. To see that composed court\\nyesterday jogging on so serenely and to think of the wretchedness of\\nthe pieces on the board gave me the headache and the heartache both\\ntogether. My head ached with wondering how it happened, if men were\\nneither fools nor rascals; and my heart ached to think they could\\npossibly be either. But at all events, Ada--I may call you Ada?\"\\n\\n\"Of course you may, cousin Richard.\"\\n\\n\"At all events, Chancery will work none of its bad influences on US.\\nWe have happily been brought together, thanks to our good kinsman,\\nand it can\\'t divide us now!\"\\n\\n\"Never, I hope, cousin Richard!\" said Ada gently.\\n\\nMiss Jellyby gave my arm a squeeze and me a very significant look. I\\nsmiled in return, and we made the rest of the way back very\\npleasantly.\\n\\nIn half an hour after our arrival, Mrs. Jellyby appeared; and in the\\ncourse of an hour the various things necessary for breakfast\\nstraggled one by one into the dining-room. I do not doubt that Mrs.\\nJellyby had gone to bed and got up in the usual manner, but she\\npresented no appearance of having changed her dress. She was greatly\\noccupied during breakfast, for the morning\\'s post brought a heavy\\ncorrespondence relative to Borrioboola-Gha, which would occasion her\\n(she said) to pass a busy day. The children tumbled about, and\\nnotched memoranda of their accidents in their legs, which were\\nperfect little calendars of distress; and Peepy was lost for an hour\\nand a half, and brought home from Newgate market by a policeman. The\\nequable manner in which Mrs. Jellyby sustained both his absence and\\nhis restoration to the family circle surprised us all.\\n\\nShe was by that time perseveringly dictating to Caddy, and Caddy was\\nfast relapsing into the inky condition in which we had found her. At\\none o\\'clock an open carriage arrived for us, and a cart for our\\nluggage. Mrs. Jellyby charged us with many remembrances to her good\\nfriend Mr. Jarndyce; Caddy left her desk to see us depart, kissed me\\nin the passage, and stood biting her pen and sobbing on the steps;\\nPeepy, I am happy to say, was asleep and spared the pain of\\nseparation (I was not without misgivings that he had gone to Newgate\\nmarket in search of me); and all the other children got up behind the\\nbarouche and fell off, and we saw them, with great concern, scattered\\nover the surface of Thavies Inn as we rolled out of its precincts.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe day had brightened very much, and still brightened as we went\\nwestward. We went our way through the sunshine and the fresh air,\\nwondering more and more at the extent of the streets, the brilliancy\\nof the shops, the great traffic, and the crowds of people whom the\\npleasanter weather seemed to have brought out like many-coloured\\nflowers. By and by we began to leave the wonderful city and to\\nproceed through suburbs which, of themselves, would have made a\\npretty large town in my eyes; and at last we got into a real country\\nroad again, with windmills, rick-yards, milestones, farmers\\' waggons,\\nscents of old hay, swinging signs, and horse troughs: trees, fields,\\nand hedge-rows. It was delightful to see the green landscape before\\nus and the immense metropolis behind; and when a waggon with a train\\nof beautiful horses, furnished with red trappings and clear-sounding\\nbells, came by us with its music, I believe we could all three have\\nsung to the bells, so cheerful were the influences around.\\n\\n\"The whole road has been reminding me of my namesake Whittington,\"\\nsaid Richard, \"and that waggon is the finishing touch. Halloa! What\\'s\\nthe matter?\"\\n\\nWe had stopped, and the waggon had stopped too. Its music changed as\\nthe horses came to a stand, and subsided to a gentle tinkling, except\\nwhen a horse tossed his head or shook himself and sprinkled off a\\nlittle shower of bell-ringing.\\n\\n\"Our postilion is looking after the waggoner,\" said Richard, \"and the\\nwaggoner is coming back after us. Good day, friend!\" The waggoner was\\nat our coach-door. \"Why, here\\'s an extraordinary thing!\" added\\nRichard, looking closely at the man. \"He has got your name, Ada, in\\nhis hat!\"\\n\\nHe had all our names in his hat. Tucked within the band were three\\nsmall notes--one addressed to Ada, one to Richard, one to me. These\\nthe waggoner delivered to each of us respectively, reading the name\\naloud first. In answer to Richard\\'s inquiry from whom they came, he\\nbriefly answered, \"Master, sir, if you please\"; and putting on his\\nhat again (which was like a soft bowl), cracked his whip, re-awakened\\nhis music, and went melodiously away.\\n\\n\"Is that Mr. Jarndyce\\'s waggon?\" said Richard, calling to our\\npost-boy.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" he replied. \"Going to London.\"\\n\\nWe opened the notes. Each was a counterpart of the other and\\ncontained these words in a solid, plain hand.\\n\\n\\n   I look forward, my dear, to our meeting easily and\\n   without constraint on either side. I therefore have to\\n   propose that we meet as old friends and take the past for\\n   granted. It will be a relief to you possibly, and to me\\n   certainly, and so my love to you.\\n\\n   John Jarndyce\\n\\n\\nI had perhaps less reason to be surprised than either of my\\ncompanions, having never yet enjoyed an opportunity of thanking one\\nwho had been my benefactor and sole earthly dependence through so\\nmany years. I had not considered how I could thank him, my gratitude\\nlying too deep in my heart for that; but I now began to consider how\\nI could meet him without thanking him, and felt it would be very\\ndifficult indeed.\\n\\nThe notes revived in Richard and Ada a general impression that they\\nboth had, without quite knowing how they came by it, that their\\ncousin Jarndyce could never bear acknowledgments for any kindness he\\nperformed and that sooner than receive any he would resort to the\\nmost singular expedients and evasions or would even run away. Ada\\ndimly remembered to have heard her mother tell, when she was a very\\nlittle child, that he had once done her an act of uncommon generosity\\nand that on her going to his house to thank him, he happened to see\\nher through a window coming to the door, and immediately escaped by\\nthe back gate, and was not heard of for three months. This discourse\\nled to a great deal more on the same theme, and indeed it lasted us\\nall day, and we talked of scarcely anything else. If we did by any\\nchance diverge into another subject, we soon returned to this, and\\nwondered what the house would be like, and when we should get there,\\nand whether we should see Mr. Jarndyce as soon as we arrived or after\\na delay, and what he would say to us, and what we should say to him.\\nAll of which we wondered about, over and over again.\\n\\nThe roads were very heavy for the horses, but the pathway was\\ngenerally good, so we alighted and walked up all the hills, and liked\\nit so well that we prolonged our walk on the level ground when we got\\nto the top. At Barnet there were other horses waiting for us, but as\\nthey had only just been fed, we had to wait for them too, and got a\\nlong fresh walk over a common and an old battle-field before the\\ncarriage came up. These delays so protracted the journey that the\\nshort day was spent and the long night had closed in before we came\\nto St. Albans, near to which town Bleak House was, we knew.\\n\\nBy that time we were so anxious and nervous that even Richard\\nconfessed, as we rattled over the stones of the old street, to\\nfeeling an irrational desire to drive back again. As to Ada and me,\\nwhom he had wrapped up with great care, the night being sharp and\\nfrosty, we trembled from head to foot. When we turned out of the\\ntown, round a corner, and Richard told us that the post-boy, who had\\nfor a long time sympathized with our heightened expectation, was\\nlooking back and nodding, we both stood up in the carriage (Richard\\nholding Ada lest she should be jolted down) and gazed round upon the\\nopen country and the starlight night for our destination. There was a\\nlight sparkling on the top of a hill before us, and the driver,\\npointing to it with his whip and crying, \"That\\'s Bleak House!\" put\\nhis horses into a canter and took us forward at such a rate, uphill\\nthough it was, that the wheels sent the road drift flying about our\\nheads like spray from a water-mill. Presently we lost the light,\\npresently saw it, presently lost it, presently saw it, and turned\\ninto an avenue of trees and cantered up towards where it was beaming\\nbrightly. It was in a window of what seemed to be an old-fashioned\\nhouse with three peaks in the roof in front and a circular sweep\\nleading to the porch. A bell was rung as we drew up, and amidst the\\nsound of its deep voice in the still air, and the distant barking of\\nsome dogs, and a gush of light from the opened door, and the smoking\\nand steaming of the heated horses, and the quickened beating of our\\nown hearts, we alighted in no inconsiderable confusion.\\n\\n\"Ada, my love, Esther, my dear, you are welcome. I rejoice to see\\nyou! Rick, if I had a hand to spare at present, I would give it you!\"\\n\\nThe gentleman who said these words in a clear, bright, hospitable\\nvoice had one of his arms round Ada\\'s waist and the other round mine,\\nand kissed us both in a fatherly way, and bore us across the hall\\ninto a ruddy little room, all in a glow with a blazing fire. Here he\\nkissed us again, and opening his arms, made us sit down side by side\\non a sofa ready drawn out near the hearth. I felt that if we had been\\nat all demonstrative, he would have run away in a moment.\\n\\n\"Now, Rick!\" said he. \"I have a hand at liberty. A word in earnest is\\nas good as a speech. I am heartily glad to see you. You are at home.\\nWarm yourself!\"\\n\\nRichard shook him by both hands with an intuitive mixture of respect\\nand frankness, and only saying (though with an earnestness that\\nrather alarmed me, I was so afraid of Mr. Jarndyce\\'s suddenly\\ndisappearing), \"You are very kind, sir! We are very much obliged to\\nyou!\" laid aside his hat and coat and came up to the fire.\\n\\n\"And how did you like the ride? And how did you like Mrs. Jellyby, my\\ndear?\" said Mr. Jarndyce to Ada.\\n\\nWhile Ada was speaking to him in reply, I glanced (I need not say\\nwith how much interest) at his face. It was a handsome, lively, quick\\nface, full of change and motion; and his hair was a silvered\\niron-grey. I took him to be nearer sixty than fifty, but he was\\nupright, hearty, and robust. From the moment of his first speaking to\\nus his voice had connected itself with an association in my mind that\\nI could not define; but now, all at once, a something sudden in his\\nmanner and a pleasant expression in his eyes recalled the gentleman\\nin the stagecoach six years ago on the memorable day of my journey to\\nReading. I was certain it was he. I never was so frightened in my\\nlife as when I made the discovery, for he caught my glance, and\\nappearing to read my thoughts, gave such a look at the door that I\\nthought we had lost him.\\n\\nHowever, I am happy to say he remained where he was, and asked me\\nwhat I thought of Mrs. Jellyby.\\n\\n\"She exerts herself very much for Africa, sir,\" I said.\\n\\n\"Nobly!\" returned Mr. Jarndyce. \"But you answer like Ada.\" Whom I had\\nnot heard. \"You all think something else, I see.\"\\n\\n\"We rather thought,\" said I, glancing at Richard and Ada, who\\nentreated me with their eyes to speak, \"that perhaps she was a little\\nunmindful of her home.\"\\n\\n\"Floored!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\nI was rather alarmed again.\\n\\n\"Well! I want to know your real thoughts, my dear. I may have sent\\nyou there on purpose.\"\\n\\n\"We thought that, perhaps,\" said I, hesitating, \"it is right to begin\\nwith the obligations of home, sir; and that, perhaps, while those are\\noverlooked and neglected, no other duties can possibly be substituted\\nfor them.\"\\n\\n\"The little Jellybys,\" said Richard, coming to my relief, \"are\\nreally--I can\\'t help expressing myself strongly, sir--in a devil of a\\nstate.\"\\n\\n\"She means well,\" said Mr. Jarndyce hastily. \"The wind\\'s in the\\neast.\"\\n\\n\"It was in the north, sir, as we came down,\" observed Richard.\\n\\n\"My dear Rick,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, poking the fire, \"I\\'ll take an\\noath it\\'s either in the east or going to be. I am always conscious of\\nan uncomfortable sensation now and then when the wind is blowing in\\nthe east.\"\\n\\n\"Rheumatism, sir?\" said Richard.\\n\\n\"I dare say it is, Rick. I believe it is. And so the little Jell--I\\nhad my doubts about \\'em--are in a--oh, Lord, yes, it\\'s easterly!\"\\nsaid Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\nHe had taken two or three undecided turns up and down while uttering\\nthese broken sentences, retaining the poker in one hand and rubbing\\nhis hair with the other, with a good-natured vexation at once so\\nwhimsical and so lovable that I am sure we were more delighted with\\nhim than we could possibly have expressed in any words. He gave an\\narm to Ada and an arm to me, and bidding Richard bring a candle, was\\nleading the way out when he suddenly turned us all back again.\\n\\n\"Those little Jellybys. Couldn\\'t you--didn\\'t you--now, if it had\\nrained sugar-plums, or three-cornered raspberry tarts, or anything of\\nthat sort!\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Oh, cousin--\" Ada hastily began.\\n\\n\"Good, my pretty pet. I like cousin. Cousin John, perhaps, is\\nbetter.\"\\n\\n\"Then, cousin John--\" Ada laughingly began again.\\n\\n\"Ha, ha! Very good indeed!\" said Mr. Jarndyce with great enjoyment.\\n\"Sounds uncommonly natural. Yes, my dear?\"\\n\\n\"It did better than that. It rained Esther.\"\\n\\n\"Aye?\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"What did Esther do?\"\\n\\n\"Why, cousin John,\" said Ada, clasping her hands upon his arm and\\nshaking her head at me across him--for I wanted her to be\\nquiet--\"Esther was their friend directly. Esther nursed them, coaxed\\nthem to sleep, washed and dressed them, told them stories, kept them\\nquiet, bought them keepsakes\"--My dear girl! I had only gone out with\\nPeepy after he was found and given him a little, tiny horse!--\"and,\\ncousin John, she softened poor Caroline, the eldest one, so much and\\nwas so thoughtful for me and so amiable! No, no, I won\\'t be\\ncontradicted, Esther dear! You know, you know, it\\'s true!\"\\n\\nThe warm-hearted darling leaned across her cousin John and kissed me,\\nand then looking up in his face, boldly said, \"At all events, cousin\\nJohn, I WILL thank you for the companion you have given me.\" I felt\\nas if she challenged him to run away. But he didn\\'t.\\n\\n\"Where did you say the wind was, Rick?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"In the north as we came down, sir.\"\\n\\n\"You are right. There\\'s no east in it. A mistake of mine. Come,\\ngirls, come and see your home!\"\\n\\nIt was one of those delightfully irregular houses where you go up and\\ndown steps out of one room into another, and where you come upon more\\nrooms when you think you have seen all there are, and where there is\\na bountiful provision of little halls and passages, and where you\\nfind still older cottage-rooms in unexpected places with lattice\\nwindows and green growth pressing through them. Mine, which we\\nentered first, was of this kind, with an up-and-down roof that had\\nmore corners in it than I ever counted afterwards and a chimney\\n(there was a wood fire on the hearth) paved all around with pure\\nwhite tiles, in every one of which a bright miniature of the fire was\\nblazing. Out of this room, you went down two steps into a charming\\nlittle sitting-room looking down upon a flower-garden, which room was\\nhenceforth to belong to Ada and me. Out of this you went up three\\nsteps into Ada\\'s bedroom, which had a fine broad window commanding a\\nbeautiful view (we saw a great expanse of darkness lying underneath\\nthe stars), to which there was a hollow window-seat, in which, with a\\nspring-lock, three dear Adas might have been lost at once. Out of\\nthis room you passed into a little gallery, with which the other best\\nrooms (only two) communicated, and so, by a little staircase of\\nshallow steps with a number of corner stairs in it, considering its\\nlength, down into the hall. But if instead of going out at Ada\\'s door\\nyou came back into my room, and went out at the door by which you had\\nentered it, and turned up a few crooked steps that branched off in an\\nunexpected manner from the stairs, you lost yourself in passages,\\nwith mangles in them, and three-cornered tables, and a native Hindu\\nchair, which was also a sofa, a box, and a bedstead, and looked in\\nevery form something between a bamboo skeleton and a great bird-cage,\\nand had been brought from India nobody knew by whom or when. From\\nthese you came on Richard\\'s room, which was part library, part\\nsitting-room, part bedroom, and seemed indeed a comfortable compound\\nof many rooms. Out of that you went straight, with a little interval\\nof passage, to the plain room where Mr. Jarndyce slept, all the year\\nround, with his window open, his bedstead without any furniture\\nstanding in the middle of the floor for more air, and his cold bath\\ngaping for him in a smaller room adjoining. Out of that you came into\\nanother passage, where there were back-stairs and where you could\\nhear the horses being rubbed down outside the stable and being told\\nto \"Hold up\" and \"Get over,\" as they slipped about very much on the\\nuneven stones. Or you might, if you came out at another door (every\\nroom had at least two doors), go straight down to the hall again by\\nhalf-a-dozen steps and a low archway, wondering how you got back\\nthere or had ever got out of it.\\n\\nThe furniture, old-fashioned rather than old, like the house, was as\\npleasantly irregular. Ada\\'s sleeping-room was all flowers--in chintz\\nand paper, in velvet, in needlework, in the brocade of two stiff\\ncourtly chairs which stood, each attended by a little page of a stool\\nfor greater state, on either side of the fire-place. Our sitting-room\\nwas green and had framed and glazed upon the walls numbers of\\nsurprising and surprised birds, staring out of pictures at a real\\ntrout in a case, as brown and shining as if it had been served with\\ngravy; at the death of Captain Cook; and at the whole process of\\npreparing tea in China, as depicted by Chinese artists. In my room\\nthere were oval engravings of the months--ladies haymaking in short\\nwaists and large hats tied under the chin, for June; smooth-legged\\nnoblemen pointing with cocked-hats to village steeples, for October.\\nHalf-length portraits in crayons abounded all through the house, but\\nwere so dispersed that I found the brother of a youthful officer of\\nmine in the china-closet and the grey old age of my pretty young\\nbride, with a flower in her bodice, in the breakfast-room. As\\nsubstitutes, I had four angels, of Queen Anne\\'s reign, taking a\\ncomplacent gentleman to heaven, in festoons, with some difficulty;\\nand a composition in needlework representing fruit, a kettle, and an\\nalphabet. All the movables, from the wardrobes to the chairs and\\ntables, hangings, glasses, even to the pincushions and scent-bottles\\non the dressing-tables, displayed the same quaint variety. They\\nagreed in nothing but their perfect neatness, their display of the\\nwhitest linen, and their storing-up, wheresoever the existence of a\\ndrawer, small or large, rendered it possible, of quantities of\\nrose-leaves and sweet lavender. Such, with its illuminated windows,\\nsoftened here and there by shadows of curtains, shining out upon the\\nstarlight night; with its light, and warmth, and comfort; with its\\nhospitable jingle, at a distance, of preparations for dinner; with\\nthe face of its generous master brightening everything we saw; and\\njust wind enough without to sound a low accompaniment to everything\\nwe heard, were our first impressions of Bleak House.\\n\\n\"I am glad you like it,\" said Mr. Jarndyce when he had brought us\\nround again to Ada\\'s sitting-room. \"It makes no pretensions, but it\\nis a comfortable little place, I hope, and will be more so with such\\nbright young looks in it. You have barely half an hour before dinner.\\nThere\\'s no one here but the finest creature upon earth--a child.\"\\n\\n\"More children, Esther!\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mean literally a child,\" pursued Mr. Jarndyce; \"not a child\\nin years. He is grown up--he is at least as old as I am--but in\\nsimplicity, and freshness, and enthusiasm, and a fine guileless\\ninaptitude for all worldly affairs, he is a perfect child.\"\\n\\nWe felt that he must be very interesting.\\n\\n\"He knows Mrs. Jellyby,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"He is a musical man, an\\namateur, but might have been a professional. He is an artist too, an\\namateur, but might have been a professional. He is a man of\\nattainments and of captivating manners. He has been unfortunate in\\nhis affairs, and unfortunate in his pursuits, and unfortunate in his\\nfamily; but he don\\'t care--he\\'s a child!\"\\n\\n\"Did you imply that he has children of his own, sir?\" inquired\\nRichard.\\n\\n\"Yes, Rick! Half-a-dozen. More! Nearer a dozen, I should think. But\\nhe has never looked after them. How could he? He wanted somebody to\\nlook after HIM. He is a child, you know!\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"And have the children looked after themselves at all, sir?\" inquired\\nRichard.\\n\\n\"Why, just as you may suppose,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, his countenance\\nsuddenly falling. \"It is said that the children of the very poor are\\nnot brought up, but dragged up. Harold Skimpole\\'s children have\\ntumbled up somehow or other. The wind\\'s getting round again, I am\\nafraid. I feel it rather!\"\\n\\nRichard observed that the situation was exposed on a sharp night.\\n\\n\"It IS exposed,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"No doubt that\\'s the cause. Bleak\\nHouse has an exposed sound. But you are coming my way. Come along!\"\\n\\nOur luggage having arrived and being all at hand, I was dressed in a\\nfew minutes and engaged in putting my worldly goods away when a maid\\n(not the one in attendance upon Ada, but another, whom I had not\\nseen) brought a basket into my room with two bunches of keys in it,\\nall labelled.\\n\\n\"For you, miss, if you please,\" said she.\\n\\n\"For me?\" said I.\\n\\n\"The housekeeping keys, miss.\"\\n\\nI showed my surprise, for she added with some little surprise on her\\nown part, \"I was told to bring them as soon as you was alone, miss.\\nMiss Summerson, if I don\\'t deceive myself?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"That is my name.\"\\n\\n\"The large bunch is the housekeeping, and the little bunch is the\\ncellars, miss. Any time you was pleased to appoint to-morrow morning,\\nI was to show you the presses and things they belong to.\"\\n\\nI said I would be ready at half-past six, and after she was gone,\\nstood looking at the basket, quite lost in the magnitude of my trust.\\nAda found me thus and had such a delightful confidence in me when I\\nshowed her the keys and told her about them that it would have been\\ninsensibility and ingratitude not to feel encouraged. I knew, to be\\nsure, that it was the dear girl\\'s kindness, but I liked to be so\\npleasantly cheated.\\n\\nWhen we went downstairs, we were presented to Mr. Skimpole, who was\\nstanding before the fire telling Richard how fond he used to be, in\\nhis school-time, of football. He was a little bright creature with a\\nrather large head, but a delicate face and a sweet voice, and there\\nwas a perfect charm in him. All he said was so free from effort and\\nspontaneous and was said with such a captivating gaiety that it was\\nfascinating to hear him talk. Being of a more slender figure than Mr.\\nJarndyce and having a richer complexion, with browner hair, he looked\\nyounger. Indeed, he had more the appearance in all respects of a\\ndamaged young man than a well-preserved elderly one. There was an\\neasy negligence in his manner and even in his dress (his hair\\ncarelessly disposed, and his neck-kerchief loose and flowing, as I\\nhave seen artists paint their own portraits) which I could not\\nseparate from the idea of a romantic youth who had undergone some\\nunique process of depreciation. It struck me as being not at all like\\nthe manner or appearance of a man who had advanced in life by the\\nusual road of years, cares, and experiences.\\n\\nI gathered from the conversation that Mr. Skimpole had been educated\\nfor the medical profession and had once lived, in his professional\\ncapacity, in the household of a German prince. He told us, however,\\nthat as he had always been a mere child in point of weights and\\nmeasures and had never known anything about them (except that they\\ndisgusted him), he had never been able to prescribe with the\\nrequisite accuracy of detail. In fact, he said, he had no head for\\ndetail. And he told us, with great humour, that when he was wanted to\\nbleed the prince or physic any of his people, he was generally found\\nlying on his back in bed, reading the newspapers or making\\nfancy-sketches in pencil, and couldn\\'t come. The prince, at last,\\nobjecting to this, \"in which,\" said Mr. Skimpole, in the frankest\\nmanner, \"he was perfectly right,\" the engagement terminated, and Mr.\\nSkimpole having (as he added with delightful gaiety) \"nothing to live\\nupon but love, fell in love, and married, and surrounded himself with\\nrosy cheeks.\" His good friend Jarndyce and some other of his good\\nfriends then helped him, in quicker or slower succession, to several\\nopenings in life, but to no purpose, for he must confess to two of\\nthe oldest infirmities in the world: one was that he had no idea of\\ntime, the other that he had no idea of money. In consequence of which\\nhe never kept an appointment, never could transact any business, and\\nnever knew the value of anything! Well! So he had got on in life, and\\nhere he was! He was very fond of reading the papers, very fond of\\nmaking fancy-sketches with a pencil, very fond of nature, very fond\\nof art. All he asked of society was to let him live. THAT wasn\\'t\\nmuch. His wants were few. Give him the papers, conversation, music,\\nmutton, coffee, landscape, fruit in the season, a few sheets of\\nBristol-board, and a little claret, and he asked no more. He was a\\nmere child in the world, but he didn\\'t cry for the moon. He said to\\nthe world, \"Go your several ways in peace! Wear red coats, blue\\ncoats, lawn sleeves; put pens behind your ears, wear aprons; go after\\nglory, holiness, commerce, trade, any object you prefer; only--let\\nHarold Skimpole live!\"\\n\\nAll this and a great deal more he told us, not only with the\\nutmost brilliancy and enjoyment, but with a certain vivacious\\ncandour--speaking of himself as if he were not at all his own affair,\\nas if Skimpole were a third person, as if he knew that Skimpole had\\nhis singularities but still had his claims too, which were the\\ngeneral business of the community and must not be slighted. He was\\nquite enchanting. If I felt at all confused at that early time in\\nendeavouring to reconcile anything he said with anything I had\\nthought about the duties and accountabilities of life (which I am far\\nfrom sure of), I was confused by not exactly understanding why he was\\nfree of them. That he WAS free of them, I scarcely doubted; he was so\\nvery clear about it himself.\\n\\n\"I covet nothing,\" said Mr. Skimpole in the same light way.\\n\"Possession is nothing to me. Here is my friend Jarndyce\\'s excellent\\nhouse. I feel obliged to him for possessing it. I can sketch it and\\nalter it. I can set it to music. When I am here, I have sufficient\\npossession of it and have neither trouble, cost, nor responsibility.\\nMy steward\\'s name, in short, is Jarndyce, and he can\\'t cheat me. We\\nhave been mentioning Mrs. Jellyby. There is a bright-eyed woman, of a\\nstrong will and immense power of business detail, who throws herself\\ninto objects with surprising ardour! I don\\'t regret that I have not a\\nstrong will and an immense power of business detail to throw myself\\ninto objects with surprising ardour. I can admire her without envy. I\\ncan sympathize with the objects. I can dream of them. I can lie down\\non the grass--in fine weather--and float along an African river,\\nembracing all the natives I meet, as sensible of the deep silence and\\nsketching the dense overhanging tropical growth as accurately as if I\\nwere there. I don\\'t know that it\\'s of any direct use my doing so, but\\nit\\'s all I can do, and I do it thoroughly. Then, for heaven\\'s sake,\\nhaving Harold Skimpole, a confiding child, petitioning you, the\\nworld, an agglomeration of practical people of business habits, to\\nlet him live and admire the human family, do it somehow or other,\\nlike good souls, and suffer him to ride his rocking-horse!\"\\n\\nIt was plain enough that Mr. Jarndyce had not been neglectful of the\\nadjuration. Mr. Skimpole\\'s general position there would have rendered\\nit so without the addition of what he presently said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s only you, the generous creatures, whom I envy,\" said Mr.\\nSkimpole, addressing us, his new friends, in an impersonal manner. \"I\\nenvy you your power of doing what you do. It is what I should revel\\nin myself. I don\\'t feel any vulgar gratitude to you. I almost feel as\\nif YOU ought to be grateful to ME for giving you the opportunity of\\nenjoying the luxury of generosity. I know you like it. For anything I\\ncan tell, I may have come into the world expressly for the purpose of\\nincreasing your stock of happiness. I may have been born to be a\\nbenefactor to you by sometimes giving you an opportunity of assisting\\nme in my little perplexities. Why should I regret my incapacity for\\ndetails and worldly affairs when it leads to such pleasant\\nconsequences? I don\\'t regret it therefore.\"\\n\\nOf all his playful speeches (playful, yet always fully meaning what\\nthey expressed) none seemed to be more to the taste of Mr. Jarndyce\\nthan this. I had often new temptations, afterwards, to wonder whether\\nit was really singular, or only singular to me, that he, who was\\nprobably the most grateful of mankind upon the least occasion, should\\nso desire to escape the gratitude of others.\\n\\nWe were all enchanted. I felt it a merited tribute to the engaging\\nqualities of Ada and Richard that Mr. Skimpole, seeing them for the\\nfirst time, should be so unreserved and should lay himself out to be\\nso exquisitely agreeable. They (and especially Richard) were\\nnaturally pleased, for similar reasons, and considered it no common\\nprivilege to be so freely confided in by such an attractive man. The\\nmore we listened, the more gaily Mr. Skimpole talked. And what with\\nhis fine hilarious manner and his engaging candour and his genial way\\nof lightly tossing his own weaknesses about, as if he had said, \"I am\\na child, you know! You are designing people compared with me\" (he\\nreally made me consider myself in that light) \"but I am gay and\\ninnocent; forget your worldly arts and play with me!\" the effect was\\nabsolutely dazzling.\\n\\nHe was so full of feeling too and had such a delicate sentiment for\\nwhat was beautiful or tender that he could have won a heart by that\\nalone. In the evening, when I was preparing to make tea and Ada was\\ntouching the piano in the adjoining room and softly humming a tune to\\nher cousin Richard, which they had happened to mention, he came and\\nsat down on the sofa near me and so spoke of Ada that I almost loved\\nhim.\\n\\n\"She is like the morning,\" he said. \"With that golden hair, those\\nblue eyes, and that fresh bloom on her cheek, she is like the summer\\nmorning. The birds here will mistake her for it. We will not call\\nsuch a lovely young creature as that, who is a joy to all mankind, an\\norphan. She is the child of the universe.\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce, I found, was standing near us with his hands behind him\\nand an attentive smile upon his face.\\n\\n\"The universe,\" he observed, \"makes rather an indifferent parent, I\\nam afraid.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I don\\'t know!\" cried Mr. Skimpole buoyantly.\\n\\n\"I think I do know,\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Well!\" cried Mr. Skimpole. \"You know the world (which in your sense\\nis the universe), and I know nothing of it, so you shall have your\\nway. But if I had mine,\" glancing at the cousins, \"there should be no\\nbrambles of sordid realities in such a path as that. It should be\\nstrewn with roses; it should lie through bowers, where there was no\\nspring, autumn, nor winter, but perpetual summer. Age or change\\nshould never wither it. The base word money should never be breathed\\nnear it!\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce patted him on the head with a smile, as if he had been\\nreally a child, and passing a step or two on, and stopping a moment,\\nglanced at the young cousins. His look was thoughtful, but had a\\nbenignant expression in it which I often (how often!) saw again,\\nwhich has long been engraven on my heart. The room in which they\\nwere, communicating with that in which he stood, was only lighted by\\nthe fire. Ada sat at the piano; Richard stood beside her, bending\\ndown. Upon the wall, their shadows blended together, surrounded by\\nstrange forms, not without a ghostly motion caught from the unsteady\\nfire, though reflecting from motionless objects. Ada touched the\\nnotes so softly and sang so low that the wind, sighing away to the\\ndistant hills, was as audible as the music. The mystery of the future\\nand the little clue afforded to it by the voice of the present seemed\\nexpressed in the whole picture.\\n\\nBut it is not to recall this fancy, well as I remember it, that I\\nrecall the scene. First, I was not quite unconscious of the contrast\\nin respect of meaning and intention between the silent look directed\\nthat way and the flow of words that had preceded it. Secondly, though\\nMr. Jarndyce\\'s glance as he withdrew it rested for but a moment on\\nme, I felt as if in that moment he confided to me--and knew that he\\nconfided to me and that I received the confidence--his hope that Ada\\nand Richard might one day enter on a dearer relationship.\\n\\nMr. Skimpole could play on the piano and the violoncello, and he was\\na composer--had composed half an opera once, but got tired of it--and\\nplayed what he composed with taste. After tea we had quite a little\\nconcert, in which Richard--who was enthralled by Ada\\'s singing and\\ntold me that she seemed to know all the songs that ever were\\nwritten--and Mr. Jarndyce, and I were the audience. After a little\\nwhile I missed first Mr. Skimpole and afterwards Richard, and while I\\nwas thinking how could Richard stay away so long and lose so much,\\nthe maid who had given me the keys looked in at the door, saying, \"If\\nyou please, miss, could you spare a minute?\"\\n\\nWhen I was shut out with her in the hall, she said, holding up her\\nhands, \"Oh, if you please, miss, Mr. Carstone says would you come\\nupstairs to Mr. Skimpole\\'s room. He has been took, miss!\"\\n\\n\"Took?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Took, miss. Sudden,\" said the maid.\\n\\nI was apprehensive that his illness might be of a dangerous kind, but\\nof course I begged her to be quiet and not disturb any one and\\ncollected myself, as I followed her quickly upstairs, sufficiently to\\nconsider what were the best remedies to be applied if it should prove\\nto be a fit. She threw open a door and I went into a chamber, where,\\nto my unspeakable surprise, instead of finding Mr. Skimpole stretched\\nupon the bed or prostrate on the floor, I found him standing before\\nthe fire smiling at Richard, while Richard, with a face of great\\nembarrassment, looked at a person on the sofa, in a white great-coat,\\nwith smooth hair upon his head and not much of it, which he was\\nwiping smoother and making less of with a pocket-handkerchief.\\n\\n\"Miss Summerson,\" said Richard hurriedly, \"I am glad you are come.\\nYou will be able to advise us. Our friend Mr. Skimpole--don\\'t be\\nalarmed!--is arrested for debt.\"\\n\\n\"And really, my dear Miss Summerson,\" said Mr. Skimpole with his\\nagreeable candour, \"I never was in a situation in which that\\nexcellent sense and quiet habit of method and usefulness, which\\nanybody must observe in you who has the happiness of being a quarter\\nof an hour in your society, was more needed.\"\\n\\nThe person on the sofa, who appeared to have a cold in his head, gave\\nsuch a very loud snort that he startled me.\\n\\n\"Are you arrested for much, sir?\" I inquired of Mr. Skimpole.\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Summerson,\" said he, shaking his head pleasantly, \"I\\ndon\\'t know. Some pounds, odd shillings, and halfpence, I think, were\\nmentioned.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s twenty-four pound, sixteen, and sevenpence ha\\'penny,\" observed\\nthe stranger. \"That\\'s wot it is.\"\\n\\n\"And it sounds--somehow it sounds,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"like a small\\nsum?\"\\n\\nThe strange man said nothing but made another snort. It was such a\\npowerful one that it seemed quite to lift him out of his seat.\\n\\n\"Mr. Skimpole,\" said Richard to me, \"has a delicacy in applying to my\\ncousin Jarndyce because he has lately--I think, sir, I understood you\\nthat you had lately--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" returned Mr. Skimpole, smiling. \"Though I forgot how much\\nit was and when it was. Jarndyce would readily do it again, but I\\nhave the epicure-like feeling that I would prefer a novelty in help,\\nthat I would rather,\" and he looked at Richard and me, \"develop\\ngenerosity in a new soil and in a new form of flower.\"\\n\\n\"What do you think will be best, Miss Summerson?\" said Richard,\\naside.\\n\\nI ventured to inquire, generally, before replying, what would happen\\nif the money were not produced.\\n\\n\"Jail,\" said the strange man, coolly putting his handkerchief into\\nhis hat, which was on the floor at his feet. \"Or Coavinses.\"\\n\\n\"May I ask, sir, what is--\"\\n\\n\"Coavinses?\" said the strange man. \"A \\'ouse.\"\\n\\nRichard and I looked at one another again. It was a most singular\\nthing that the arrest was our embarrassment and not Mr. Skimpole\\'s.\\nHe observed us with a genial interest, but there seemed, if I may\\nventure on such a contradiction, nothing selfish in it. He had\\nentirely washed his hands of the difficulty, and it had become ours.\\n\\n\"I thought,\" he suggested, as if good-naturedly to help us out, \"that\\nbeing parties in a Chancery suit concerning (as people say) a large\\namount of property, Mr. Richard or his beautiful cousin, or both,\\ncould sign something, or make over something, or give some sort of\\nundertaking, or pledge, or bond? I don\\'t know what the business name\\nof it may be, but I suppose there is some instrument within their\\npower that would settle this?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit on it,\" said the strange man.\\n\\n\"Really?\" returned Mr. Skimpole. \"That seems odd, now, to one who is\\nno judge of these things!\"\\n\\n\"Odd or even,\" said the stranger gruffly, \"I tell you, not a bit on\\nit!\"\\n\\n\"Keep your temper, my good fellow, keep your temper!\" Mr. Skimpole\\ngently reasoned with him as he made a little drawing of his head on\\nthe fly-leaf of a book. \"Don\\'t be ruffled by your occupation. We can\\nseparate you from your office; we can separate the individual from\\nthe pursuit. We are not so prejudiced as to suppose that in private\\nlife you are otherwise than a very estimable man, with a great deal\\nof poetry in your nature, of which you may not be conscious.\"\\n\\nThe stranger only answered with another violent snort, whether in\\nacceptance of the poetry-tribute or in disdainful rejection of it, he\\ndid not express to me.\\n\\n\"Now, my dear Miss Summerson, and my dear Mr. Richard,\" said Mr.\\nSkimpole gaily, innocently, and confidingly as he looked at his\\ndrawing with his head on one side, \"here you see me utterly incapable\\nof helping myself, and entirely in your hands! I only ask to be free.\\nThe butterflies are free. Mankind will surely not deny to Harold\\nSkimpole what it concedes to the butterflies!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Summerson,\" said Richard in a whisper, \"I have ten\\npounds that I received from Mr. Kenge. I must try what that will do.\"\\n\\nI possessed fifteen pounds, odd shillings, which I had saved from my\\nquarterly allowance during several years. I had always thought that\\nsome accident might happen which would throw me suddenly, without any\\nrelation or any property, on the world and had always tried to keep\\nsome little money by me that I might not be quite penniless. I told\\nRichard of my having this little store and having no present need of\\nit, and I asked him delicately to inform Mr. Skimpole, while I should\\nbe gone to fetch it, that we would have the pleasure of paying his\\ndebt.\\n\\nWhen I came back, Mr. Skimpole kissed my hand and seemed quite\\ntouched. Not on his own account (I was again aware of that perplexing\\nand extraordinary contradiction), but on ours, as if personal\\nconsiderations were impossible with him and the contemplation of our\\nhappiness alone affected him. Richard, begging me, for the greater\\ngrace of the transaction, as he said, to settle with Coavinses (as\\nMr. Skimpole now jocularly called him), I counted out the money and\\nreceived the necessary acknowledgment. This, too, delighted Mr.\\nSkimpole.\\n\\nHis compliments were so delicately administered that I blushed less\\nthan I might have done and settled with the stranger in the white\\ncoat without making any mistakes. He put the money in his pocket and\\nshortly said, \"Well, then, I\\'ll wish you a good evening, miss.\\n\\n\"My friend,\" said Mr. Skimpole, standing with his back to the fire\\nafter giving up the sketch when it was half finished, \"I should like\\nto ask you something, without offence.\"\\n\\nI think the reply was, \"Cut away, then!\"\\n\\n\"Did you know this morning, now, that you were coming out on this\\nerrand?\" said Mr. Skimpole.\\n\\n\"Know\\'d it yes\\'day aft\\'noon at tea-time,\" said Coavinses.\\n\\n\"It didn\\'t affect your appetite? Didn\\'t make you at all uneasy?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit,\" said Coavinses. \"I know\\'d if you wos missed to-day, you\\nwouldn\\'t be missed to-morrow. A day makes no such odds.\"\\n\\n\"But when you came down here,\" proceeded Mr. Skimpole, \"it was a fine\\nday. The sun was shining, the wind was blowing, the lights and\\nshadows were passing across the fields, the birds were singing.\"\\n\\n\"Nobody said they warn\\'t, in MY hearing,\" returned Coavinses.\\n\\n\"No,\" observed Mr. Skimpole. \"But what did you think upon the road?\"\\n\\n\"Wot do you mean?\" growled Coavinses with an appearance of strong\\nresentment. \"Think! I\\'ve got enough to do, and little enough to get\\nfor it without thinking. Thinking!\" (with profound contempt).\\n\\n\"Then you didn\\'t think, at all events,\" proceeded Mr. Skimpole, \"to\\nthis effect: \\'Harold Skimpole loves to see the sun shine, loves to\\nhear the wind blow, loves to watch the changing lights and shadows,\\nloves to hear the birds, those choristers in Nature\\'s great\\ncathedral. And does it seem to me that I am about to deprive Harold\\nSkimpole of his share in such possessions, which are his only\\nbirthright!\\' You thought nothing to that effect?\"\\n\\n\"I--certainly--did--NOT,\" said Coavinses, whose doggedness in utterly\\nrenouncing the idea was of that intense kind that he could only give\\nadequate expression to it by putting a long interval between each\\nword, and accompanying the last with a jerk that might have\\ndislocated his neck.\\n\\n\"Very odd and very curious, the mental process is, in you men of\\nbusiness!\" said Mr. Skimpole thoughtfully. \"Thank you, my friend.\\nGood night.\"\\n\\nAs our absence had been long enough already to seem strange\\ndownstairs, I returned at once and found Ada sitting at work by the\\nfireside talking to her cousin John. Mr. Skimpole presently appeared,\\nand Richard shortly after him. I was sufficiently engaged during the\\nremainder of the evening in taking my first lesson in backgammon from\\nMr. Jarndyce, who was very fond of the game and from whom I wished of\\ncourse to learn it as quickly as I could in order that I might be of\\nthe very small use of being able to play when he had no better\\nadversary. But I thought, occasionally, when Mr. Skimpole played some\\nfragments of his own compositions or when, both at the piano and the\\nvioloncello, and at our table, he preserved with an absence of all\\neffort his delightful spirits and his easy flow of conversation, that\\nRichard and I seemed to retain the transferred impression of having\\nbeen arrested since dinner and that it was very curious altogether.\\n\\nIt was late before we separated, for when Ada was going at eleven\\no\\'clock, Mr. Skimpole went to the piano and rattled hilariously that\\nthe best of all ways to lengthen our days was to steal a few hours\\nfrom night, my dear! It was past twelve before he took his candle and\\nhis radiant face out of the room, and I think he might have kept us\\nthere, if he had seen fit, until daybreak. Ada and Richard were\\nlingering for a few moments by the fire, wondering whether Mrs.\\nJellyby had yet finished her dictation for the day, when Mr.\\nJarndyce, who had been out of the room, returned.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear me, what\\'s this, what\\'s this!\" he said, rubbing his head\\nand walking about with his good-humoured vexation. \"What\\'s this they\\ntell me? Rick, my boy, Esther, my dear, what have you been doing? Why\\ndid you do it? How could you do it? How much apiece was it? The\\nwind\\'s round again. I feel it all over me!\"\\n\\nWe neither of us quite knew what to answer.\\n\\n\"Come, Rick, come! I must settle this before I sleep. How much are\\nyou out of pocket? You two made the money up, you know! Why did you?\\nHow could you? Oh, Lord, yes, it\\'s due east--must be!\"\\n\\n\"Really, sir,\" said Richard, \"I don\\'t think it would be honourable in\\nme to tell you. Mr. Skimpole relied upon us--\"\\n\\n\"Lord bless you, my dear boy! He relies upon everybody!\" said Mr.\\nJarndyce, giving his head a great rub and stopping short.\\n\\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Everybody! And he\\'ll be in the same scrape again next week!\" said\\nMr. Jarndyce, walking again at a great pace, with a candle in his\\nhand that had gone out. \"He\\'s always in the same scrape. He was born\\nin the same scrape. I verily believe that the announcement in the\\nnewspapers when his mother was confined was \\'On Tuesday last, at her\\nresidence in Botheration Buildings, Mrs. Skimpole of a son in\\ndifficulties.\\'\"\\n\\nRichard laughed heartily but added, \"Still, sir, I don\\'t want to\\nshake his confidence or to break his confidence, and if I submit to\\nyour better knowledge again, that I ought to keep his secret, I hope\\nyou will consider before you press me any more. Of course, if you do\\npress me, sir, I shall know I am wrong and will tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce, stopping again, and making several absent\\nendeavours to put his candlestick in his pocket. \"I--here! Take it\\naway, my dear. I don\\'t know what I am about with it; it\\'s all the\\nwind--invariably has that effect--I won\\'t press you, Rick; you may be\\nright. But really--to get hold of you and Esther--and to squeeze you\\nlike a couple of tender young Saint Michael\\'s oranges! It\\'ll blow a\\ngale in the course of the night!\"\\n\\nHe was now alternately putting his hands into his pockets as if he\\nwere going to keep them there a long time, and taking them out again\\nand vehemently rubbing them all over his head.\\n\\nI ventured to take this opportunity of hinting that Mr. Skimpole,\\nbeing in all such matters quite a child--\\n\\n\"Eh, my dear?\" said Mr. Jarndyce, catching at the word.\\n\\n\"Being quite a child, sir,\" said I, \"and so different from other\\npeople--\"\\n\\n\"You are right!\" said Mr. Jarndyce, brightening. \"Your woman\\'s wit\\nhits the mark. He is a child--an absolute child. I told you he was a\\nchild, you know, when I first mentioned him.\"\\n\\nCertainly! Certainly! we said.\\n\\n\"And he IS a child. Now, isn\\'t he?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce, brightening\\nmore and more.\\n\\nHe was indeed, we said.\\n\\n\"When you come to think of it, it\\'s the height of childishness in\\nyou--I mean me--\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to regard him for a moment as a\\nman. You can\\'t make HIM responsible. The idea of Harold Skimpole with\\ndesigns or plans, or knowledge of consequences! Ha, ha, ha!\"\\n\\nIt was so delicious to see the clouds about his bright face clearing,\\nand to see him so heartily pleased, and to know, as it was impossible\\nnot to know, that the source of his pleasure was the goodness which\\nwas tortured by condemning, or mistrusting, or secretly accusing any\\none, that I saw the tears in Ada\\'s eyes, while she echoed his laugh,\\nand felt them in my own.\\n\\n\"Why, what a cod\\'s head and shoulders I am,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to\\nrequire reminding of it! The whole business shows the child from\\nbeginning to end. Nobody but a child would have thought of singling\\nYOU two out for parties in the affair! Nobody but a child would have\\nthought of YOUR having the money! If it had been a thousand pounds,\\nit would have been just the same!\" said Mr. Jarndyce with his whole\\nface in a glow.\\n\\nWe all confirmed it from our night\\'s experience.\\n\\n\"To be sure, to be sure!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"However, Rick, Esther,\\nand you too, Ada, for I don\\'t know that even your little purse is\\nsafe from his inexperience--I must have a promise all round that\\nnothing of this sort shall ever be done any more. No advances! Not\\neven sixpences.\"\\n\\nWe all promised faithfully, Richard with a merry glance at me\\ntouching his pocket as if to remind me that there was no danger of\\nOUR transgressing.\\n\\n\"As to Skimpole,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"a habitable doll\\'s house with\\ngood board and a few tin people to get into debt with and borrow\\nmoney of would set the boy up in life. He is in a child\\'s sleep by\\nthis time, I suppose; it\\'s time I should take my craftier head to my\\nmore worldly pillow. Good night, my dears. God bless you!\"\\n\\nHe peeped in again, with a smiling face, before we had lighted our\\ncandles, and said, \"Oh! I have been looking at the weather-cock. I\\nfind it was a false alarm about the wind. It\\'s in the south!\" And\\nwent away singing to himself.\\n\\nAda and I agreed, as we talked together for a little while upstairs,\\nthat this caprice about the wind was a fiction and that he used the\\npretence to account for any disappointment he could not conceal,\\nrather than he would blame the real cause of it or disparage or\\ndepreciate any one. We thought this very characteristic of his\\neccentric gentleness and of the difference between him and those\\npetulant people who make the weather and the winds (particularly that\\nunlucky wind which he had chosen for such a different purpose) the\\nstalking-horses of their splenetic and gloomy humours.\\n\\nIndeed, so much affection for him had been added in this one evening\\nto my gratitude that I hoped I already began to understand him\\nthrough that mingled feeling. Any seeming inconsistencies in Mr.\\nSkimpole or in Mrs. Jellyby I could not expect to be able to\\nreconcile, having so little experience or practical knowledge.\\nNeither did I try, for my thoughts were busy when I was alone, with\\nAda and Richard and with the confidence I had seemed to receive\\nconcerning them. My fancy, made a little wild by the wind perhaps,\\nwould not consent to be all unselfish, either, though I would have\\npersuaded it to be so if I could. It wandered back to my godmother\\'s\\nhouse and came along the intervening track, raising up shadowy\\nspeculations which had sometimes trembled there in the dark as to\\nwhat knowledge Mr. Jarndyce had of my earliest history--even as to\\nthe possibility of his being my father, though that idle dream was\\nquite gone now.\\n\\nIt was all gone now, I remembered, getting up from the fire. It was\\nnot for me to muse over bygones, but to act with a cheerful spirit\\nand a grateful heart. So I said to myself, \"Esther, Esther, Esther!\\nDuty, my dear!\" and gave my little basket of housekeeping keys such a\\nshake that they sounded like little bells and rang me hopefully to\\nbed.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile Esther sleeps, and while Esther wakes, it is still wet weather\\ndown at the place in Lincolnshire. The rain is ever falling--drip,\\ndrip, drip--by day and night upon the broad flagged terrace-pavement,\\nthe Ghost\\'s Walk. The weather is so very bad down in Lincolnshire\\nthat the liveliest imagination can scarcely apprehend its ever being\\nfine again. Not that there is any superabundant life of imagination\\non the spot, for Sir Leicester is not here (and, truly, even if he\\nwere, would not do much for it in that particular), but is in Paris\\nwith my Lady; and solitude, with dusky wings, sits brooding upon\\nChesney Wold.\\n\\nThere may be some motions of fancy among the lower animals at Chesney\\nWold. The horses in the stables--the long stables in a barren,\\nred-brick court-yard, where there is a great bell in a turret, and a\\nclock with a large face, which the pigeons who live near it and who\\nlove to perch upon its shoulders seem to be always consulting--THEY\\nmay contemplate some mental pictures of fine weather on occasions,\\nand may be better artists at them than the grooms. The old roan, so\\nfamous for cross-country work, turning his large eyeball to the\\ngrated window near his rack, may remember the fresh leaves that\\nglisten there at other times and the scents that stream in, and may\\nhave a fine run with the hounds, while the human helper, clearing out\\nthe next stall, never stirs beyond his pitchfork and birch-broom. The\\ngrey, whose place is opposite the door and who with an impatient\\nrattle of his halter pricks his ears and turns his head so wistfully\\nwhen it is opened, and to whom the opener says, \"Woa grey, then,\\nsteady! Noabody wants you to-day!\" may know it quite as well as the\\nman. The whole seemingly monotonous and uncompanionable half-dozen,\\nstabled together, may pass the long wet hours when the door is shut\\nin livelier communication than is held in the servants\\' hall or at\\nthe Dedlock Arms, or may even beguile the time by improving (perhaps\\ncorrupting) the pony in the loose-box in the corner.\\n\\nSo the mastiff, dozing in his kennel in the court-yard with his large\\nhead on his paws, may think of the hot sunshine when the shadows of\\nthe stable-buildings tire his patience out by changing and leave him\\nat one time of the day no broader refuge than the shadow of his own\\nhouse, where he sits on end, panting and growling short, and very\\nmuch wanting something to worry besides himself and his chain. So\\nnow, half-waking and all-winking, he may recall the house full of\\ncompany, the coach-houses full of vehicles, the stables full of\\nhorses, and the out-buildings full of attendants upon horses, until\\nhe is undecided about the present and comes forth to see how it is.\\nThen, with that impatient shake of himself, he may growl in the\\nspirit, \"Rain, rain, rain! Nothing but rain--and no family here!\" as\\nhe goes in again and lies down with a gloomy yawn.\\n\\nSo with the dogs in the kennel-buildings across the park, who have\\ntheir restless fits and whose doleful voices when the wind has been\\nvery obstinate have even made it known in the house itself--upstairs,\\ndownstairs, and in my Lady\\'s chamber. They may hunt the whole\\ncountry-side, while the raindrops are pattering round their\\ninactivity. So the rabbits with their self-betraying tails, frisking\\nin and out of holes at roots of trees, may be lively with ideas of\\nthe breezy days when their ears are blown about or of those seasons\\nof interest when there are sweet young plants to gnaw. The turkey in\\nthe poultry-yard, always troubled with a class-grievance (probably\\nChristmas), may be reminiscent of that summer morning wrongfully\\ntaken from him when he got into the lane among the felled trees,\\nwhere there was a barn and barley. The discontented goose, who stoops\\nto pass under the old gateway, twenty feet high, may gabble out, if\\nwe only knew it, a waddling preference for weather when the gateway\\ncasts its shadow on the ground.\\n\\nBe this as it may, there is not much fancy otherwise stirring at\\nChesney Wold. If there be a little at any odd moment, it goes, like a\\nlittle noise in that old echoing place, a long way and usually leads\\noff to ghosts and mystery.\\n\\nIt has rained so hard and rained so long down in Lincolnshire that\\nMrs. Rouncewell, the old housekeeper at Chesney Wold, has several\\ntimes taken off her spectacles and cleaned them to make certain that\\nthe drops were not upon the glasses. Mrs. Rouncewell might have been\\nsufficiently assured by hearing the rain, but that she is rather\\ndeaf, which nothing will induce her to believe. She is a fine old\\nlady, handsome, stately, wonderfully neat, and has such a back and\\nsuch a stomacher that if her stays should turn out when she dies to\\nhave been a broad old-fashioned family fire-grate, nobody who knows\\nher would have cause to be surprised. Weather affects Mrs. Rouncewell\\nlittle. The house is there in all weathers, and the house, as she\\nexpresses it, \"is what she looks at.\" She sits in her room (in a side\\npassage on the ground floor, with an arched window commanding a\\nsmooth quadrangle, adorned at regular intervals with smooth round\\ntrees and smooth round blocks of stone, as if the trees were going to\\nplay at bowls with the stones), and the whole house reposes on her\\nmind. She can open it on occasion and be busy and fluttered, but it\\nis shut up now and lies on the breadth of Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s\\niron-bound bosom in a majestic sleep.\\n\\nIt is the next difficult thing to an impossibility to imagine Chesney\\nWold without Mrs. Rouncewell, but she has only been here fifty years.\\nAsk her how long, this rainy day, and she shall answer \"fifty year,\\nthree months, and a fortnight, by the blessing of heaven, if I live\\ntill Tuesday.\" Mr. Rouncewell died some time before the decease of\\nthe pretty fashion of pig-tails, and modestly hid his own (if he took\\nit with him) in a corner of the churchyard in the park near the\\nmouldy porch. He was born in the market-town, and so was his young\\nwidow. Her progress in the family began in the time of the last Sir\\nLeicester and originated in the still-room.\\n\\nThe present representative of the Dedlocks is an excellent master. He\\nsupposes all his dependents to be utterly bereft of individual\\ncharacters, intentions, or opinions, and is persuaded that he was\\nborn to supersede the necessity of their having any. If he were to\\nmake a discovery to the contrary, he would be simply stunned--would\\nnever recover himself, most likely, except to gasp and die. But he is\\nan excellent master still, holding it a part of his state to be so.\\nHe has a great liking for Mrs. Rouncewell; he says she is a most\\nrespectable, creditable woman. He always shakes hands with her when\\nhe comes down to Chesney Wold and when he goes away; and if he were\\nvery ill, or if he were knocked down by accident, or run over, or\\nplaced in any situation expressive of a Dedlock at a disadvantage, he\\nwould say if he could speak, \"Leave me, and send Mrs. Rouncewell\\nhere!\" feeling his dignity, at such a pass, safer with her than with\\nanybody else.\\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell has known trouble. She has had two sons, of whom the\\nyounger ran wild, and went for a soldier, and never came back. Even\\nto this hour, Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s calm hands lose their composure when\\nshe speaks of him, and unfolding themselves from her stomacher, hover\\nabout her in an agitated manner as she says what a likely lad, what a\\nfine lad, what a gay, good-humoured, clever lad he was! Her second\\nson would have been provided for at Chesney Wold and would have been\\nmade steward in due season, but he took, when he was a schoolboy, to\\nconstructing steam-engines out of saucepans and setting birds to draw\\ntheir own water with the least possible amount of labour, so\\nassisting them with artful contrivance of hydraulic pressure that a\\nthirsty canary had only, in a literal sense, to put his shoulder to\\nthe wheel and the job was done. This propensity gave Mrs. Rouncewell\\ngreat uneasiness. She felt it with a mother\\'s anguish to be a move in\\nthe Wat Tyler direction, well knowing that Sir Leicester had that\\ngeneral impression of an aptitude for any art to which smoke and a\\ntall chimney might be considered essential. But the doomed young\\nrebel (otherwise a mild youth, and very persevering), showing no sign\\nof grace as he got older but, on the contrary, constructing a model\\nof a power-loom, she was fain, with many tears, to mention his\\nbackslidings to the baronet. \"Mrs. Rouncewell,\" said Sir Leicester,\\n\"I can never consent to argue, as you know, with any one on any\\nsubject. You had better get rid of your boy; you had better get him\\ninto some Works. The iron country farther north is, I suppose, the\\ncongenial direction for a boy with these tendencies.\" Farther north\\nhe went, and farther north he grew up; and if Sir Leicester Dedlock\\never saw him when he came to Chesney Wold to visit his mother, or\\never thought of him afterwards, it is certain that he only regarded\\nhim as one of a body of some odd thousand conspirators, swarthy and\\ngrim, who were in the habit of turning out by torchlight two or three\\nnights in the week for unlawful purposes.\\n\\nNevertheless, Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s son has, in the course of nature and\\nart, grown up, and established himself, and married, and called unto\\nhim Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s grandson, who, being out of his apprenticeship,\\nand home from a journey in far countries, whither he was sent to\\nenlarge his knowledge and complete his preparations for the venture\\nof this life, stands leaning against the chimney-piece this very day\\nin Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s room at Chesney Wold.\\n\\n\"And, again and again, I am glad to see you, Watt! And, once again, I\\nam glad to see you, Watt!\" says Mrs. Rouncewell. \"You are a fine\\nyoung fellow. You are like your poor uncle George. Ah!\" Mrs.\\nRouncewell\\'s hands unquiet, as usual, on this reference.\\n\\n\"They say I am like my father, grandmother.\"\\n\\n\"Like him, also, my dear--but most like your poor uncle George! And\\nyour dear father.\" Mrs. Rouncewell folds her hands again. \"He is\\nwell?\"\\n\\n\"Thriving, grandmother, in every way.\"\\n\\n\"I am thankful!\" Mrs. Rouncewell is fond of her son but has a\\nplaintive feeling towards him, much as if he were a very honourable\\nsoldier who had gone over to the enemy.\\n\\n\"He is quite happy?\" says she.\\n\\n\"Quite.\"\\n\\n\"I am thankful! So he has brought you up to follow in his ways and\\nhas sent you into foreign countries and the like? Well, he knows\\nbest. There may be a world beyond Chesney Wold that I don\\'t\\nunderstand. Though I am not young, either. And I have seen a quantity\\nof good company too!\"\\n\\n\"Grandmother,\" says the young man, changing the subject, \"what a very\\npretty girl that was I found with you just now. You called her Rosa?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, child. She is daughter of a widow in the village. Maids are so\\nhard to teach, now-a-days, that I have put her about me young. She\\'s\\nan apt scholar and will do well. She shows the house already, very\\npretty. She lives with me at my table here.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I have not driven her away?\"\\n\\n\"She supposes we have family affairs to speak about, I dare say. She\\nis very modest. It is a fine quality in a young woman. And scarcer,\"\\nsays Mrs. Rouncewell, expanding her stomacher to its utmost limits,\\n\"than it formerly was!\"\\n\\nThe young man inclines his head in acknowledgment of the precepts of\\nexperience. Mrs. Rouncewell listens.\\n\\n\"Wheels!\" says she. They have long been audible to the younger ears\\nof her companion. \"What wheels on such a day as this, for gracious\\nsake?\"\\n\\nAfter a short interval, a tap at the door. \"Come in!\" A dark-eyed,\\ndark-haired, shy, village beauty comes in--so fresh in her rosy and\\nyet delicate bloom that the drops of rain which have beaten on her\\nhair look like the dew upon a flower fresh gathered.\\n\\n\"What company is this, Rosa?\" says Mrs. Rouncewell.\\n\\n\"It\\'s two young men in a gig, ma\\'am, who want to see the house--yes,\\nand if you please, I told them so!\" in quick reply to a gesture of\\ndissent from the housekeeper. \"I went to the hall-door and told them\\nit was the wrong day and the wrong hour, but the young man who was\\ndriving took off his hat in the wet and begged me to bring this card\\nto you.\"\\n\\n\"Read it, my dear Watt,\" says the housekeeper.\\n\\nRosa is so shy as she gives it to him that they drop it between them\\nand almost knock their foreheads together as they pick it up. Rosa is\\nshyer than before.\\n\\n\"Mr. Guppy\" is all the information the card yields.\\n\\n\"Guppy!\" repeats Mrs. Rouncewell, \"MR. Guppy! Nonsense, I never heard\\nof him!\"\\n\\n\"If you please, he told ME that!\" says Rosa. \"But he said that he and\\nthe other young gentleman came from London only last night by the\\nmail, on business at the magistrates\\' meeting, ten miles off, this\\nmorning, and that as their business was soon over, and they had heard\\na great deal said of Chesney Wold, and really didn\\'t know what to do\\nwith themselves, they had come through the wet to see it. They are\\nlawyers. He says he is not in Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s office, but he is\\nsure he may make use of Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s name if necessary.\"\\nFinding, now she leaves off, that she has been making quite a long\\nspeech, Rosa is shyer than ever.\\n\\nNow, Mr. Tulkinghorn is, in a manner, part and parcel of the place,\\nand besides, is supposed to have made Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s will. The old\\nlady relaxes, consents to the admission of the visitors as a favour,\\nand dismisses Rosa. The grandson, however, being smitten by a sudden\\nwish to see the house himself, proposes to join the party. The\\ngrandmother, who is pleased that he should have that interest,\\naccompanies him--though to do him justice, he is exceedingly\\nunwilling to trouble her.\\n\\n\"Much obliged to you, ma\\'am!\" says Mr. Guppy, divesting himself of\\nhis wet dreadnought in the hall. \"Us London lawyers don\\'t often get\\nan out, and when we do, we like to make the most of it, you know.\"\\n\\nThe old housekeeper, with a gracious severity of deportment, waves\\nher hand towards the great staircase. Mr. Guppy and his friend follow\\nRosa; Mrs. Rouncewell and her grandson follow them; a young gardener\\ngoes before to open the shutters.\\n\\nAs is usually the case with people who go over houses, Mr. Guppy and\\nhis friend are dead beat before they have well begun. They straggle\\nabout in wrong places, look at wrong things, don\\'t care for the right\\nthings, gape when more rooms are opened, exhibit profound depression\\nof spirits, and are clearly knocked up. In each successive chamber\\nthat they enter, Mrs. Rouncewell, who is as upright as the house\\nitself, rests apart in a window-seat or other such nook and listens\\nwith stately approval to Rosa\\'s exposition. Her grandson is so\\nattentive to it that Rosa is shyer than ever--and prettier. Thus they\\npass on from room to room, raising the pictured Dedlocks for a few\\nbrief minutes as the young gardener admits the light, and\\nreconsigning them to their graves as he shuts it out again. It\\nappears to the afflicted Mr. Guppy and his inconsolable friend that\\nthere is no end to the Dedlocks, whose family greatness seems to\\nconsist in their never having done anything to distinguish themselves\\nfor seven hundred years.\\n\\nEven the long drawing-room of Chesney Wold cannot revive Mr. Guppy\\'s\\nspirits. He is so low that he droops on the threshold and has hardly\\nstrength of mind to enter. But a portrait over the chimney-piece,\\npainted by the fashionable artist of the day, acts upon him like a\\ncharm. He recovers in a moment. He stares at it with uncommon\\ninterest; he seems to be fixed and fascinated by it.\\n\\n\"Dear me!\" says Mr. Guppy. \"Who\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"The picture over the fire-place,\" says Rosa, \"is the portrait of the\\npresent Lady Dedlock. It is considered a perfect likeness, and the\\nbest work of the master.\"\\n\\n\"Blest,\" says Mr. Guppy, staring in a kind of dismay at his friend,\\n\"if I can ever have seen her. Yet I know her! Has the picture been\\nengraved, miss?\"\\n\\n\"The picture has never been engraved. Sir Leicester has always\\nrefused permission.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" says Mr. Guppy in a low voice. \"I\\'ll be shot if it ain\\'t very\\ncurious how well I know that picture! So that\\'s Lady Dedlock, is it!\"\\n\\n\"The picture on the right is the present Sir Leicester Dedlock. The\\npicture on the left is his father, the late Sir Leicester.\"\\n\\nMr. Guppy has no eyes for either of these magnates. \"It\\'s\\nunaccountable to me,\" he says, still staring at the portrait, \"how\\nwell I know that picture! I\\'m dashed,\" adds Mr. Guppy, looking round,\\n\"if I don\\'t think I must have had a dream of that picture, you know!\"\\n\\nAs no one present takes any especial interest in Mr. Guppy\\'s dreams,\\nthe probability is not pursued. But he still remains so absorbed by\\nthe portrait that he stands immovable before it until the young\\ngardener has closed the shutters, when he comes out of the room in a\\ndazed state that is an odd though a sufficient substitute for\\ninterest and follows into the succeeding rooms with a confused stare,\\nas if he were looking everywhere for Lady Dedlock again.\\n\\nHe sees no more of her. He sees her rooms, which are the last shown,\\nas being very elegant, and he looks out of the windows from which she\\nlooked out, not long ago, upon the weather that bored her to death.\\nAll things have an end, even houses that people take infinite pains\\nto see and are tired of before they begin to see them. He has come to\\nthe end of the sight, and the fresh village beauty to the end of her\\ndescription; which is always this: \"The terrace below is much\\nadmired. It is called, from an old story in the family, the Ghost\\'s\\nWalk.\"\\n\\n\"No?\" says Mr. Guppy, greedily curious. \"What\\'s the story, miss? Is\\nit anything about a picture?\"\\n\\n\"Pray tell us the story,\" says Watt in a half whisper.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know it, sir.\" Rosa is shyer than ever.\\n\\n\"It is not related to visitors; it is almost forgotten,\" says the\\nhousekeeper, advancing. \"It has never been more than a family\\nanecdote.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll excuse my asking again if it has anything to do with a\\npicture, ma\\'am,\" observes Mr. Guppy, \"because I do assure you that\\nthe more I think of that picture the better I know it, without\\nknowing how I know it!\"\\n\\nThe story has nothing to do with a picture; the housekeeper can\\nguarantee that. Mr. Guppy is obliged to her for the information and\\nis, moreover, generally obliged. He retires with his friend, guided\\ndown another staircase by the young gardener, and presently is heard\\nto drive away. It is now dusk. Mrs. Rouncewell can trust to the\\ndiscretion of her two young hearers and may tell THEM how the terrace\\ncame to have that ghostly name.\\n\\nShe seats herself in a large chair by the fast-darkening window and\\ntells them: \"In the wicked days, my dears, of King Charles the\\nFirst--I mean, of course, in the wicked days of the rebels who\\nleagued themselves against that excellent king--Sir Morbury Dedlock\\nwas the owner of Chesney Wold. Whether there was any account of a\\nghost in the family before those days, I can\\'t say. I should think it\\nvery likely indeed.\"\\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell holds this opinion because she considers that a\\nfamily of such antiquity and importance has a right to a ghost. She\\nregards a ghost as one of the privileges of the upper classes, a\\ngenteel distinction to which the common people have no claim.\\n\\n\"Sir Morbury Dedlock,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell, \"was, I have no occasion\\nto say, on the side of the blessed martyr. But it IS supposed that\\nhis Lady, who had none of the family blood in her veins, favoured the\\nbad cause. It is said that she had relations among King Charles\\'s\\nenemies, that she was in correspondence with them, and that she gave\\nthem information. When any of the country gentlemen who followed his\\nMajesty\\'s cause met here, it is said that my Lady was always nearer\\nto the door of their council-room than they supposed. Do you hear a\\nsound like a footstep passing along the terrace, Watt?\"\\n\\nRosa draws nearer to the housekeeper.\\n\\n\"I hear the rain-drip on the stones,\" replies the young man, \"and I\\nhear a curious echo--I suppose an echo--which is very like a halting\\nstep.\"\\n\\nThe housekeeper gravely nods and continues: \"Partly on account of\\nthis division between them, and partly on other accounts, Sir Morbury\\nand his Lady led a troubled life. She was a lady of a haughty temper.\\nThey were not well suited to each other in age or character, and they\\nhad no children to moderate between them. After her favourite\\nbrother, a young gentleman, was killed in the civil wars (by Sir\\nMorbury\\'s near kinsman), her feeling was so violent that she hated\\nthe race into which she had married. When the Dedlocks were about to\\nride out from Chesney Wold in the king\\'s cause, she is supposed to\\nhave more than once stolen down into the stables in the dead of night\\nand lamed their horses; and the story is that once at such an hour,\\nher husband saw her gliding down the stairs and followed her into the\\nstall where his own favourite horse stood. There he seized her by the\\nwrist, and in a struggle or in a fall or through the horse being\\nfrightened and lashing out, she was lamed in the hip and from that\\nhour began to pine away.\"\\n\\nThe housekeeper has dropped her voice to a little more than a\\nwhisper.\\n\\n\"She had been a lady of a handsome figure and a noble carriage. She\\nnever complained of the change; she never spoke to any one of being\\ncrippled or of being in pain, but day by day she tried to walk upon\\nthe terrace, and with the help of the stone balustrade, went up and\\ndown, up and down, up and down, in sun and shadow, with greater\\ndifficulty every day. At last, one afternoon her husband (to whom she\\nhad never, on any persuasion, opened her lips since that night),\\nstanding at the great south window, saw her drop upon the pavement.\\nHe hastened down to raise her, but she repulsed him as he bent over\\nher, and looking at him fixedly and coldly, said, \\'I will die here\\nwhere I have walked. And I will walk here, though I am in my grave. I\\nwill walk here until the pride of this house is humbled. And when\\ncalamity or when disgrace is coming to it, let the Dedlocks listen\\nfor my step!\\'\"\\n\\nWatt looks at Rosa. Rosa in the deepening gloom looks down upon the\\nground, half frightened and half shy.\\n\\n\"There and then she died. And from those days,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell,\\n\"the name has come down--the Ghost\\'s Walk. If the tread is an echo,\\nit is an echo that is only heard after dark, and is often unheard for\\na long while together. But it comes back from time to time; and so\\nsure as there is sickness or death in the family, it will be heard\\nthen.\"\\n\\n\"And disgrace, grandmother--\" says Watt.\\n\\n\"Disgrace never comes to Chesney Wold,\" returns the housekeeper.\\n\\nHer grandson apologizes with \"True. True.\"\\n\\n\"That is the story. Whatever the sound is, it is a worrying sound,\"\\nsays Mrs. Rouncewell, getting up from her chair; \"and what is to be\\nnoticed in it is that it MUST BE HEARD. My Lady, who is afraid of\\nnothing, admits that when it is there, it must be heard. You cannot\\nshut it out. Watt, there is a tall French clock behind you (placed\\nthere, \\'a purpose) that has a loud beat when it is in motion and can\\nplay music. You understand how those things are managed?\"\\n\\n\"Pretty well, grandmother, I think.\"\\n\\n\"Set it a-going.\"\\n\\nWatt sets it a-going--music and all.\\n\\n\"Now, come hither,\" says the housekeeper. \"Hither, child, towards my\\nLady\\'s pillow. I am not sure that it is dark enough yet, but listen!\\nCan you hear the sound upon the terrace, through the music, and the\\nbeat, and everything?\"\\n\\n\"I certainly can!\"\\n\\n\"So my Lady says.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'model_output': '\\n\\nThe story follows Esther Summerson, a young woman raised in secrecy who is sent to live at Bleak House. There she befriends two other wards, Ada Clare and Richard Carstone, and helps care for neglected children. Esther learns she has a mysterious connection to the aristocratic Dedlock family, owners of the grand estate Chesney Wold. \\n\\nRichard becomes obsessed with the endless court case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce, which consumes lives. He falls into debt. Themes of social class, law versus justice, family versus society, and parent-child relationships emerge. There is a sense of mystery and foreboding.\\n\\nAt Chesney Wold, visitors hear gothic tales of the Dedlock family, like the ghost of Lady Dedlock who died mysteriously and still haunts the manor. Class differences arise between the Dedlocks and staff like housekeeper Mrs. Rouncewell. Most intriguing are the unexplained ghostly footsteps heard around Chesney Wold, leaving an air of mystery.'}, {'summary': 'Esther and Mr. Jarndyce discuss the Chancery suit, and Esther leans that it is a hopeless muddle, and anything left of the great fortune disputed within it has been consumed by legal costs. The story of Tom Jarndyce is related again; we learn that Bleak House, once called Peaks, took its name during Tom Jarndyce\\'s lifetime because he allowed it to go to rack and ruin. The street of houses in London, which we will learn later is called Tom-all-Alone\\'s, is part of the suit also. Esther learns that Mr. Jarndyce, who begs her to call him Guardian, has a little room he retreats to when he is out of sorts called \"The Growlery.\"\\n\\nMrs. Pardiggle and her five miserable sons arrive for a visit. Mrs. Pardiggle is a country version of Mrs. Jellyby, another obsessive and misguided philanthropist who neglects her children in favor of a fashionable charity. She takes the young people to a brickmaker\\'s hovel in the village, and there Ada and Esther witness not only the lives of poverty and filth and despair that the people there live, but also the death of the brickmaker\\'s baby in his mother\\'s (Jenny) lap. The girls are much moved, and Esther significantly covers the tiny corpse with her handkerchief. The young ladies are moved by the downtrodden, beaten brickmakers\\' wives (Jenny and Liz) comforting each other, and it is contrasted with their bluster and ineffectual do-gooding. They come back later to comfort Jenny.\\n\\nIn Chapter 9 Richard is unsure what to do with his life. Esther and Jarndyce had discussed what he should do for a profession, and the two agree that to ask him what he would like to do would be best. But Richard cannot decide, and it becomes apparent that the spectre of the Chancery suit, though he claims to ignore it, holds a psychic hold on him.\\n\\nMr. Boythorn has written Mr. Jandyce a letter, and he is coming for a visit. He arrives and proves to be a boisterous and agreeable companion. We learn that he was once to have been married, but his fiance \"died to him.\" The dispute over the right-of-way between Sir Leicester Dedlock and Boythorn, who are neighbors, is introduced, and Boythorn is voluble in his criticism of the baronet. However, Boythorn is fond of Lady Dedlock.\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce writes to Sir Leicester Dedlock, who is a distant relative of Richard, to ask with help placing Richard in the world. He receives no likely help from that quarter.\\n\\nIt becomes obvious to Esther that Ada and Richard have fallen in love. Mr. Guppy arrives at Bleak House on an errand for Kenge and Carboy\\'s. He proposes marriage to Esther, who firmly rejects him.\\n\\nIn Chapter 10 Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby and their law-stationery shop in London are described. Mrs. Snagsby is an awful termagent, and Mr. Snagsby is timid and cowed. They have a maid, Guster, who is prone to fits. It is a pathetic description, for Mr. Snagsby appears to be a decent man.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn\\'s London lodgings are described, where \"lawyers lie like maggots in nuts\". Mr. Tulkinghorn goes to Snagsby\\'s shop to find out who copied out the paper of Jarndyce and Jarndyce in which Lady Dedlock took such an interest. The Coavinses sherrif\\'s officers (bailiff\\'s -- repossesion agents) offices, the firm in which Neckett the debt-collector for Skimpole employed, are nearby.\\n\\nMr. Snagsby informs Mr. Tulkinghorn that a man called Nemo (the Latin for \"no one\"), who lives above Krook\\'s shop, is the copyist. Mr. Snagsby brings Mr. Tulkinghorn to Krook\\'s shop, and Mr. Tulkinghorn goes up to Nemo\\'s room, where he finds him lying on the bed with the scent of opium in the shabby room.', 'text': 'It was interesting when I dressed before daylight to peep out of\\nwindow, where my candles were reflected in the black panes like\\ntwo beacons, and finding all beyond still enshrouded in the\\nindistinctness of last night, to watch how it turned out when the day\\ncame on. As the prospect gradually revealed itself and disclosed the\\nscene over which the wind had wandered in the dark, like my memory\\nover my life, I had a pleasure in discovering the unknown objects\\nthat had been around me in my sleep. At first they were faintly\\ndiscernible in the mist, and above them the later stars still\\nglimmered. That pale interval over, the picture began to enlarge and\\nfill up so fast that at every new peep I could have found enough\\nto look at for an hour. Imperceptibly my candles became the only\\nincongruous part of the morning, the dark places in my room all\\nmelted away, and the day shone bright upon a cheerful landscape,\\nprominent in which the old Abbey Church, with its massive tower,\\nthrew a softer train of shadow on the view than seemed compatible\\nwith its rugged character. But so from rough outsides (I hope I have\\nlearnt), serene and gentle influences often proceed.\\n\\nEvery part of the house was in such order, and every one was so\\nattentive to me, that I had no trouble with my two bunches of keys,\\nthough what with trying to remember the contents of each little\\nstore-room drawer and cupboard; and what with making notes on a slate\\nabout jams, and pickles, and preserves, and bottles, and glass, and\\nchina, and a great many other things; and what with being generally a\\nmethodical, old-maidish sort of foolish little person, I was so busy\\nthat I could not believe it was breakfast-time when I heard the bell\\nring. Away I ran, however, and made tea, as I had already been\\ninstalled into the responsibility of the tea-pot; and then, as they\\nwere all rather late and nobody was down yet, I thought I would take\\na peep at the garden and get some knowledge of that too. I found it\\nquite a delightful place--in front, the pretty avenue and drive by\\nwhich we had approached (and where, by the by, we had cut up the\\ngravel so terribly with our wheels that I asked the gardener to roll\\nit); at the back, the flower-garden, with my darling at her window up\\nthere, throwing it open to smile out at me, as if she would have\\nkissed me from that distance. Beyond the flower-garden was a\\nkitchen-garden, and then a paddock, and then a snug little rick-yard,\\nand then a dear little farm-yard. As to the house itself, with its\\nthree peaks in the roof; its various-shaped windows, some so large,\\nsome so small, and all so pretty; its trellis-work, against the\\nsouth-front for roses and honey-suckle, and its homely, comfortable,\\nwelcoming look--it was, as Ada said when she came out to meet me with\\nher arm through that of its master, worthy of her cousin John, a bold\\nthing to say, though he only pinched her dear cheek for it.\\n\\nMr. Skimpole was as agreeable at breakfast as he had been overnight.\\nThere was honey on the table, and it led him into a discourse about\\nbees. He had no objection to honey, he said (and I should think he\\nhad not, for he seemed to like it), but he protested against the\\noverweening assumptions of bees. He didn\\'t at all see why the busy\\nbee should be proposed as a model to him; he supposed the bee liked\\nto make honey, or he wouldn\\'t do it--nobody asked him. It was not\\nnecessary for the bee to make such a merit of his tastes. If every\\nconfectioner went buzzing about the world banging against everything\\nthat came in his way and egotistically calling upon everybody to take\\nnotice that he was going to his work and must not be interrupted, the\\nworld would be quite an unsupportable place. Then, after all, it was\\na ridiculous position to be smoked out of your fortune with brimstone\\nas soon as you had made it. You would have a very mean opinion of a\\nManchester man if he spun cotton for no other purpose. He must say he\\nthought a drone the embodiment of a pleasanter and wiser idea. The\\ndrone said unaffectedly, \"You will excuse me; I really cannot attend\\nto the shop! I find myself in a world in which there is so much to\\nsee and so short a time to see it in that I must take the liberty of\\nlooking about me and begging to be provided for by somebody who\\ndoesn\\'t want to look about him.\" This appeared to Mr. Skimpole to be\\nthe drone philosophy, and he thought it a very good philosophy,\\nalways supposing the drone to be willing to be on good terms with the\\nbee, which, so far as he knew, the easy fellow always was, if the\\nconsequential creature would only let him, and not be so conceited\\nabout his honey!\\n\\nHe pursued this fancy with the lightest foot over a variety of ground\\nand made us all merry, though again he seemed to have as serious a\\nmeaning in what he said as he was capable of having. I left them\\nstill listening to him when I withdrew to attend to my new duties.\\nThey had occupied me for some time, and I was passing through the\\npassages on my return with my basket of keys on my arm when Mr.\\nJarndyce called me into a small room next his bed-chamber, which I\\nfound to be in part a little library of books and papers and in part\\nquite a little museum of his boots and shoes and hat-boxes.\\n\\n\"Sit down, my dear,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"This, you must know, is the\\ngrowlery. When I am out of humour, I come and growl here.\"\\n\\n\"You must be here very seldom, sir,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh, you don\\'t know me!\" he returned. \"When I am deceived or\\ndisappointed in--the wind, and it\\'s easterly, I take refuge here. The\\ngrowlery is the best-used room in the house. You are not aware of\\nhalf my humours yet. My dear, how you are trembling!\"\\n\\nI could not help it; I tried very hard, but being alone with that\\nbenevolent presence, and meeting his kind eyes, and feeling so happy\\nand so honoured there, and my heart so full--I kissed his hand. I\\ndon\\'t know what I said, or even that I spoke. He was disconcerted and\\nwalked to the window; I almost believed with an intention of jumping\\nout, until he turned and I was reassured by seeing in his eyes what\\nhe had gone there to hide. He gently patted me on the head, and I sat\\ndown.\\n\\n\"There! There!\" he said. \"That\\'s over. Pooh! Don\\'t be foolish.\"\\n\\n\"It shall not happen again, sir,\" I returned, \"but at first it is\\ndifficult--\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\" he said. \"It\\'s easy, easy. Why not? I hear of a good\\nlittle orphan girl without a protector, and I take it into my head to\\nbe that protector. She grows up, and more than justifies my good\\nopinion, and I remain her guardian and her friend. What is there in\\nall this? So, so! Now, we have cleared off old scores, and I have\\nbefore me thy pleasant, trusting, trusty face again.\"\\n\\nI said to myself, \"Esther, my dear, you surprise me! This really is\\nnot what I expected of you!\" And it had such a good effect that I\\nfolded my hands upon my basket and quite recovered myself. Mr.\\nJarndyce, expressing his approval in his face, began to talk to me as\\nconfidentially as if I had been in the habit of conversing with him\\nevery morning for I don\\'t know how long. I almost felt as if I had.\\n\\n\"Of course, Esther,\" he said, \"you don\\'t understand this Chancery\\nbusiness?\"\\n\\nAnd of course I shook my head.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know who does,\" he returned. \"The lawyers have twisted it\\ninto such a state of bedevilment that the original merits of the case\\nhave long disappeared from the face of the earth. It\\'s about a will\\nand the trusts under a will--or it was once. It\\'s about nothing but\\ncosts now. We are always appearing, and disappearing, and swearing,\\nand interrogating, and filing, and cross-filing, and arguing, and\\nsealing, and motioning, and referring, and reporting, and revolving\\nabout the Lord Chancellor and all his satellites, and equitably\\nwaltzing ourselves off to dusty death, about costs. That\\'s the great\\nquestion. All the rest, by some extraordinary means, has melted\\naway.\"\\n\\n\"But it was, sir,\" said I, to bring him back, for he began to rub his\\nhead, \"about a will?\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes, it was about a will when it was about anything,\" he\\nreturned. \"A certain Jarndyce, in an evil hour, made a great fortune,\\nand made a great will. In the question how the trusts under that will\\nare to be administered, the fortune left by the will is squandered\\naway; the legatees under the will are reduced to such a miserable\\ncondition that they would be sufficiently punished if they had\\ncommitted an enormous crime in having money left them, and the will\\nitself is made a dead letter. All through the deplorable cause,\\neverything that everybody in it, except one man, knows already is\\nreferred to that only one man who don\\'t know, it to find out--all\\nthrough the deplorable cause, everybody must have copies, over and\\nover again, of everything that has accumulated about it in the way of\\ncartloads of papers (or must pay for them without having them, which\\nis the usual course, for nobody wants them) and must go down the\\nmiddle and up again through such an infernal country-dance of costs\\nand fees and nonsense and corruption as was never dreamed of in the\\nwildest visions of a witch\\'s Sabbath. Equity sends questions to law,\\nlaw sends questions back to equity; law finds it can\\'t do this,\\nequity finds it can\\'t do that; neither can so much as say it can\\'t\\ndo anything, without this solicitor instructing and this counsel\\nappearing for A, and that solicitor instructing and that counsel\\nappearing for B; and so on through the whole alphabet, like the\\nhistory of the apple pie. And thus, through years and years, and\\nlives and lives, everything goes on, constantly beginning over and\\nover again, and nothing ever ends. And we can\\'t get out of the suit\\non any terms, for we are made parties to it, and MUST BE parties to\\nit, whether we like it or not. But it won\\'t do to think of it! When\\nmy great uncle, poor Tom Jarndyce, began to think of it, it was the\\nbeginning of the end!\"\\n\\n\"The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard?\"\\n\\nHe nodded gravely. \"I was his heir, and this was his house, Esther.\\nWhen I came here, it was bleak indeed. He had left the signs of his\\nmisery upon it.\"\\n\\n\"How changed it must be now!\" I said.\\n\\n\"It had been called, before his time, the Peaks. He gave it its\\npresent name and lived here shut up, day and night poring over the\\nwicked heaps of papers in the suit and hoping against hope to\\ndisentangle it from its mystification and bring it to a close. In the\\nmeantime, the place became dilapidated, the wind whistled through the\\ncracked walls, the rain fell through the broken roof, the weeds\\nchoked the passage to the rotting door. When I brought what remained\\nof him home here, the brains seemed to me to have been blown out of\\nthe house too, it was so shattered and ruined.\"\\n\\nHe walked a little to and fro after saying this to himself with a\\nshudder, and then looked at me, and brightened, and came and sat down\\nagain with his hands in his pockets.\\n\\n\"I told you this was the growlery, my dear. Where was I?\"\\n\\nI reminded him, at the hopeful change he had made in Bleak House.\\n\\n\"Bleak House; true. There is, in that city of London there, some\\nproperty of ours which is much at this day what Bleak House was then;\\nI say property of ours, meaning of the suit\\'s, but I ought to call it\\nthe property of costs, for costs is the only power on earth that will\\never get anything out of it now or will ever know it for anything but\\nan eyesore and a heartsore. It is a street of perishing blind houses,\\nwith their eyes stoned out, without a pane of glass, without so much\\nas a window-frame, with the bare blank shutters tumbling from their\\nhinges and falling asunder, the iron rails peeling away in flakes of\\nrust, the chimneys sinking in, the stone steps to every door (and\\nevery door might be death\\'s door) turning stagnant green, the very\\ncrutches on which the ruins are propped decaying. Although Bleak\\nHouse was not in Chancery, its master was, and it was stamped with\\nthe same seal. These are the Great Seal\\'s impressions, my dear, all\\nover England--the children know them!\"\\n\\n\"How changed it is!\" I said again.\\n\\n\"Why, so it is,\" he answered much more cheerfully; \"and it is wisdom\\nin you to keep me to the bright side of the picture.\" (The idea of my\\nwisdom!) \"These are things I never talk about or even think about,\\nexcepting in the growlery here. If you consider it right to mention\\nthem to Rick and Ada,\" looking seriously at me, \"you can. I leave it\\nto your discretion, Esther.\"\\n\\n\"I hope, sir--\" said I.\\n\\n\"I think you had better call me guardian, my dear.\"\\n\\nI felt that I was choking again--I taxed myself with it, \"Esther,\\nnow, you know you are!\"--when he feigned to say this slightly, as if\\nit were a whim instead of a thoughtful tenderness. But I gave the\\nhousekeeping keys the least shake in the world as a reminder to\\nmyself, and folding my hands in a still more determined manner on the\\nbasket, looked at him quietly.\\n\\n\"I hope, guardian,\" said I, \"that you may not trust too much to my\\ndiscretion. I hope you may not mistake me. I am afraid it will be a\\ndisappointment to you to know that I am not clever, but it really is\\nthe truth, and you would soon find it out if I had not the honesty to\\nconfess it.\"\\n\\nHe did not seem at all disappointed; quite the contrary. He told me,\\nwith a smile all over his face, that he knew me very well indeed and\\nthat I was quite clever enough for him.\\n\\n\"I hope I may turn out so,\" said I, \"but I am much afraid of it,\\nguardian.\"\\n\\n\"You are clever enough to be the good little woman of our lives here,\\nmy dear,\" he returned playfully; \"the little old woman of the child\\'s\\n(I don\\'t mean Skimpole\\'s) rhyme:\\n\\n\\n   \"\\'Little old woman, and whither so high?\\'\\n    \\'To sweep the cobwebs out of the sky.\\'\\n\\n\\n\"You will sweep them so neatly out of OUR sky in the course of your\\nhousekeeping, Esther, that one of these days we shall have to abandon\\nthe growlery and nail up the door.\"\\n\\nThis was the beginning of my being called Old Woman, and Little Old\\nWoman, and Cobweb, and Mrs. Shipton, and Mother Hubbard, and Dame\\nDurden, and so many names of that sort that my own name soon became\\nquite lost among them.\\n\\n\"However,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to return to our gossip. Here\\'s Rick,\\na fine young fellow full of promise. What\\'s to be done with him?\"\\n\\nOh, my goodness, the idea of asking my advice on such a point!\\n\\n\"Here he is, Esther,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, comfortably putting his\\nhands into his pockets and stretching out his legs. \"He must have a\\nprofession; he must make some choice for himself. There will be a\\nworld more wiglomeration about it, I suppose, but it must be done.\"\\n\\n\"More what, guardian?\" said I.\\n\\n\"More wiglomeration,\" said he. \"It\\'s the only name I know for the\\nthing. He is a ward in Chancery, my dear. Kenge and Carboy will have\\nsomething to say about it; Master Somebody--a sort of ridiculous\\nsexton, digging graves for the merits of causes in a back room at the\\nend of Quality Court, Chancery Lane--will have something to say about\\nit; counsel will have something to say about it; the Chancellor will\\nhave something to say about it; the satellites will have something to\\nsay about it; they will all have to be handsomely feed, all round,\\nabout it; the whole thing will be vastly ceremonious, wordy,\\nunsatisfactory, and expensive, and I call it, in general,\\nwiglomeration. How mankind ever came to be afflicted with\\nwiglomeration, or for whose sins these young people ever fell into a\\npit of it, I don\\'t know; so it is.\"\\n\\nHe began to rub his head again and to hint that he felt the wind. But\\nit was a delightful instance of his kindness towards me that whether\\nhe rubbed his head, or walked about, or did both, his face was sure\\nto recover its benignant expression as it looked at mine; and he was\\nsure to turn comfortable again and put his hands in his pockets and\\nstretch out his legs.\\n\\n\"Perhaps it would be best, first of all,\" said I, \"to ask Mr. Richard\\nwhat he inclines to himself.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly so,\" he returned. \"That\\'s what I mean! You know, just\\naccustom yourself to talk it over, with your tact and in your quiet\\nway, with him and Ada, and see what you all make of it. We are sure\\nto come at the heart of the matter by your means, little woman.\"\\n\\nI really was frightened at the thought of the importance I was\\nattaining and the number of things that were being confided to me. I\\nhad not meant this at all; I had meant that he should speak to\\nRichard. But of course I said nothing in reply except that I would do\\nmy best, though I feared (I really felt it necessary to repeat this)\\nthat he thought me much more sagacious than I was. At which my\\nguardian only laughed the pleasantest laugh I ever heard.\\n\\n\"Come!\" he said, rising and pushing back his chair. \"I think we may\\nhave done with the growlery for one day! Only a concluding word.\\nEsther, my dear, do you wish to ask me anything?\"\\n\\nHe looked so attentively at me that I looked attentively at him and\\nfelt sure I understood him.\\n\\n\"About myself, sir?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Guardian,\" said I, venturing to put my hand, which was suddenly\\ncolder than I could have wished, in his, \"nothing! I am quite sure\\nthat if there were anything I ought to know or had any need to know,\\nI should not have to ask you to tell it to me. If my whole reliance\\nand confidence were not placed in you, I must have a hard heart\\nindeed. I have nothing to ask you, nothing in the world.\"\\n\\nHe drew my hand through his arm and we went away to look for Ada.\\nFrom that hour I felt quite easy with him, quite unreserved, quite\\ncontent to know no more, quite happy.\\n\\nWe lived, at first, rather a busy life at Bleak House, for we had to\\nbecome acquainted with many residents in and out of the neighbourhood\\nwho knew Mr. Jarndyce. It seemed to Ada and me that everybody knew\\nhim who wanted to do anything with anybody else\\'s money. It amazed us\\nwhen we began to sort his letters and to answer some of them for him\\nin the growlery of a morning to find how the great object of the\\nlives of nearly all his correspondents appeared to be to form\\nthemselves into committees for getting in and laying out money. The\\nladies were as desperate as the gentlemen; indeed, I think they were\\neven more so. They threw themselves into committees in the most\\nimpassioned manner and collected subscriptions with a vehemence quite\\nextraordinary. It appeared to us that some of them must pass their\\nwhole lives in dealing out subscription-cards to the whole\\npost-office directory--shilling cards, half-crown cards,\\nhalf-sovereign cards, penny cards. They wanted everything. They\\nwanted wearing apparel, they wanted linen rags, they wanted money,\\nthey wanted coals, they wanted soup, they wanted interest, they\\nwanted autographs, they wanted flannel, they wanted whatever Mr.\\nJarndyce had--or had not. Their objects were as various as their\\ndemands. They were going to raise new buildings, they were going to\\npay off debts on old buildings, they were going to establish in a\\npicturesque building (engraving of proposed west elevation attached)\\nthe Sisterhood of Mediaeval Marys, they were going to give a\\ntestimonial to Mrs. Jellyby, they were going to have their\\nsecretary\\'s portrait painted and presented to his mother-in-law,\\nwhose deep devotion to him was well known, they were going to get up\\neverything, I really believe, from five hundred thousand tracts to an\\nannuity and from a marble monument to a silver tea-pot. They took a\\nmultitude of titles. They were the Women of England, the Daughters of\\nBritain, the Sisters of all the cardinal virtues separately, the\\nFemales of America, the Ladies of a hundred denominations. They\\nappeared to be always excited about canvassing and electing. They\\nseemed to our poor wits, and according to their own accounts, to be\\nconstantly polling people by tens of thousands, yet never bringing\\ntheir candidates in for anything. It made our heads ache to think, on\\nthe whole, what feverish lives they must lead.\\n\\nAmong the ladies who were most distinguished for this rapacious\\nbenevolence (if I may use the expression) was a Mrs. Pardiggle, who\\nseemed, as I judged from the number of her letters to Mr. Jarndyce,\\nto be almost as powerful a correspondent as Mrs. Jellyby herself. We\\nobserved that the wind always changed when Mrs. Pardiggle became the\\nsubject of conversation and that it invariably interrupted Mr.\\nJarndyce and prevented his going any farther, when he had remarked\\nthat there were two classes of charitable people; one, the people who\\ndid a little and made a great deal of noise; the other, the people\\nwho did a great deal and made no noise at all. We were therefore\\ncurious to see Mrs. Pardiggle, suspecting her to be a type of the\\nformer class, and were glad when she called one day with her five\\nyoung sons.\\n\\nShe was a formidable style of lady with spectacles, a prominent nose,\\nand a loud voice, who had the effect of wanting a great deal of room.\\nAnd she really did, for she knocked down little chairs with her\\nskirts that were quite a great way off. As only Ada and I were at\\nhome, we received her timidly, for she seemed to come in like cold\\nweather and to make the little Pardiggles blue as they followed.\\n\\n\"These, young ladies,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle with great volubility\\nafter the first salutations, \"are my five boys. You may have seen\\ntheir names in a printed subscription list (perhaps more than one) in\\nthe possession of our esteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce. Egbert, my eldest\\n(twelve), is the boy who sent out his pocket-money, to the amount of\\nfive and threepence, to the Tockahoopo Indians. Oswald, my second\\n(ten and a half), is the child who contributed two and nine-pence to\\nthe Great National Smithers Testimonial. Francis, my third (nine),\\none and sixpence halfpenny; Felix, my fourth (seven), eightpence to\\nthe Superannuated Widows; Alfred, my youngest (five), has voluntarily\\nenrolled himself in the Infant Bonds of Joy, and is pledged never,\\nthrough life, to use tobacco in any form.\"\\n\\nWe had never seen such dissatisfied children. It was not merely that\\nthey were weazened and shrivelled--though they were certainly that\\ntoo--but they looked absolutely ferocious with discontent. At the\\nmention of the Tockahoopo Indians, I could really have supposed\\nEgbert to be one of the most baleful members of that tribe, he gave\\nme such a savage frown. The face of each child, as the amount of his\\ncontribution was mentioned, darkened in a peculiarly vindictive\\nmanner, but his was by far the worst. I must except, however, the\\nlittle recruit into the Infant Bonds of Joy, who was stolidly and\\nevenly miserable.\\n\\n\"You have been visiting, I understand,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"at Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s?\"\\n\\nWe said yes, we had passed one night there.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Jellyby,\" pursued the lady, always speaking in the same\\ndemonstrative, loud, hard tone, so that her voice impressed my fancy\\nas if it had a sort of spectacles on too--and I may take the\\nopportunity of remarking that her spectacles were made the less\\nengaging by her eyes being what Ada called \"choking eyes,\" meaning\\nvery prominent--\"Mrs. Jellyby is a benefactor to society and deserves\\na helping hand. My boys have contributed to the African\\nproject--Egbert, one and six, being the entire allowance of nine\\nweeks; Oswald, one and a penny halfpenny, being the same; the rest,\\naccording to their little means. Nevertheless, I do not go with Mrs.\\nJellyby in all things. I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in her treatment\\nof her young family. It has been noticed. It has been observed that\\nher young family are excluded from participation in the objects to\\nwhich she is devoted. She may be right, she may be wrong; but, right\\nor wrong, this is not my course with MY young family. I take them\\neverywhere.\"\\n\\nI was afterwards convinced (and so was Ada) that from the\\nill-conditioned eldest child, these words extorted a sharp yell. He\\nturned it off into a yawn, but it began as a yell.\\n\\n\"They attend matins with me (very prettily done) at half-past six\\no\\'clock in the morning all the year round, including of course the\\ndepth of winter,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle rapidly, \"and they are with me\\nduring the revolving duties of the day. I am a School lady, I am a\\nVisiting lady, I am a Reading lady, I am a Distributing lady; I am on\\nthe local Linen Box Committee and many general committees; and my\\ncanvassing alone is very extensive--perhaps no one\\'s more so. But\\nthey are my companions everywhere; and by these means they acquire\\nthat knowledge of the poor, and that capacity of doing charitable\\nbusiness in general--in short, that taste for the sort of\\nthing--which will render them in after life a service to their\\nneighbours and a satisfaction to themselves. My young family are not\\nfrivolous; they expend the entire amount of their allowance in\\nsubscriptions, under my direction; and they have attended as many\\npublic meetings and listened to as many lectures, orations, and\\ndiscussions as generally fall to the lot of few grown people. Alfred\\n(five), who, as I mentioned, has of his own election joined the\\nInfant Bonds of Joy, was one of the very few children who manifested\\nconsciousness on that occasion after a fervid address of two hours\\nfrom the chairman of the evening.\"\\n\\nAlfred glowered at us as if he never could, or would, forgive the\\ninjury of that night.\\n\\n\"You may have observed, Miss Summerson,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"in\\nsome of the lists to which I have referred, in the possession of our\\nesteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce, that the names of my young family are\\nconcluded with the name of O. A. Pardiggle, F.R.S., one pound. That\\nis their father. We usually observe the same routine. I put down my\\nmite first; then my young family enrol their contributions, according\\nto their ages and their little means; and then Mr. Pardiggle brings\\nup the rear. Mr. Pardiggle is happy to throw in his limited donation,\\nunder my direction; and thus things are made not only pleasant to\\nourselves, but, we trust, improving to others.\"\\n\\nSuppose Mr. Pardiggle were to dine with Mr. Jellyby, and suppose Mr.\\nJellyby were to relieve his mind after dinner to Mr. Pardiggle, would\\nMr. Pardiggle, in return, make any confidential communication to Mr.\\nJellyby? I was quite confused to find myself thinking this, but it\\ncame into my head.\\n\\n\"You are very pleasantly situated here!\" said Mrs. Pardiggle.\\n\\nWe were glad to change the subject, and going to the window, pointed\\nout the beauties of the prospect, on which the spectacles appeared to\\nme to rest with curious indifference.\\n\\n\"You know Mr. Gusher?\" said our visitor.\\n\\nWe were obliged to say that we had not the pleasure of Mr. Gusher\\'s\\nacquaintance.\\n\\n\"The loss is yours, I assure you,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle with her\\ncommanding deportment. \"He is a very fervid, impassioned\\nspeaker--full of fire! Stationed in a waggon on this lawn, now,\\nwhich, from the shape of the land, is naturally adapted to a public\\nmeeting, he would improve almost any occasion you could mention for\\nhours and hours! By this time, young ladies,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle,\\nmoving back to her chair and overturning, as if by invisible agency,\\na little round table at a considerable distance with my work-basket\\non it, \"by this time you have found me out, I dare say?\"\\n\\nThis was really such a confusing question that Ada looked at me in\\nperfect dismay. As to the guilty nature of my own consciousness after\\nwhat I had been thinking, it must have been expressed in the colour\\nof my cheeks.\\n\\n\"Found out, I mean,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"the prominent point in my\\ncharacter. I am aware that it is so prominent as to be discoverable\\nimmediately. I lay myself open to detection, I know. Well! I freely\\nadmit, I am a woman of business. I love hard work; I enjoy hard work.\\nThe excitement does me good. I am so accustomed and inured to hard\\nwork that I don\\'t know what fatigue is.\"\\n\\nWe murmured that it was very astonishing and very gratifying, or\\nsomething to that effect. I don\\'t think we knew what it was either,\\nbut this is what our politeness expressed.\\n\\n\"I do not understand what it is to be tired; you cannot tire me if\\nyou try!\" said Mrs. Pardiggle. \"The quantity of exertion (which is no\\nexertion to me), the amount of business (which I regard as nothing),\\nthat I go through sometimes astonishes myself. I have seen my young\\nfamily, and Mr. Pardiggle, quite worn out with witnessing it, when I\\nmay truly say I have been as fresh as a lark!\"\\n\\nIf that dark-visaged eldest boy could look more malicious than he had\\nalready looked, this was the time when he did it. I observed that he\\ndoubled his right fist and delivered a secret blow into the crown of\\nhis cap, which was under his left arm.\\n\\n\"This gives me a great advantage when I am making my rounds,\" said\\nMrs. Pardiggle. \"If I find a person unwilling to hear what I have to\\nsay, I tell that person directly, \\'I am incapable of fatigue, my good\\nfriend, I am never tired, and I mean to go on until I have done.\\' It\\nanswers admirably! Miss Summerson, I hope I shall have your\\nassistance in my visiting rounds immediately, and Miss Clare\\'s very\\nsoon.\"\\n\\nAt first I tried to excuse myself for the present on the general\\nground of having occupations to attend to which I must not neglect.\\nBut as this was an ineffectual protest, I then said, more\\nparticularly, that I was not sure of my qualifications. That I was\\ninexperienced in the art of adapting my mind to minds very\\ndifferently situated, and addressing them from suitable points of\\nview. That I had not that delicate knowledge of the heart which must\\nbe essential to such a work. That I had much to learn, myself, before\\nI could teach others, and that I could not confide in my good\\nintentions alone. For these reasons I thought it best to be as useful\\nas I could, and to render what kind services I could to those\\nimmediately about me, and to try to let that circle of duty gradually\\nand naturally expand itself. All this I said with anything but\\nconfidence, because Mrs. Pardiggle was much older than I, and had\\ngreat experience, and was so very military in her manners.\\n\\n\"You are wrong, Miss Summerson,\" said she, \"but perhaps you are not\\nequal to hard work or the excitement of it, and that makes a vast\\ndifference. If you would like to see how I go through my work, I am\\nnow about--with my young family--to visit a brickmaker in the\\nneighbourhood (a very bad character) and shall be glad to take you\\nwith me. Miss Clare also, if she will do me the favour.\"\\n\\nAda and I interchanged looks, and as we were going out in any case,\\naccepted the offer. When we hastily returned from putting on our\\nbonnets, we found the young family languishing in a corner and Mrs.\\nPardiggle sweeping about the room, knocking down nearly all the light\\nobjects it contained. Mrs. Pardiggle took possession of Ada, and I\\nfollowed with the family.\\n\\nAda told me afterwards that Mrs. Pardiggle talked in the same loud\\ntone (that, indeed, I overheard) all the way to the brickmaker\\'s\\nabout an exciting contest which she had for two or three years waged\\nagainst another lady relative to the bringing in of their rival\\ncandidates for a pension somewhere. There had been a quantity of\\nprinting, and promising, and proxying, and polling, and it appeared\\nto have imparted great liveliness to all concerned, except the\\npensioners--who were not elected yet.\\n\\nI am very fond of being confided in by children and am happy in being\\nusually favoured in that respect, but on this occasion it gave me\\ngreat uneasiness. As soon as we were out of doors, Egbert, with the\\nmanner of a little footpad, demanded a shilling of me on the ground\\nthat his pocket-money was \"boned\" from him. On my pointing out the\\ngreat impropriety of the word, especially in connexion with his\\nparent (for he added sulkily \"By her!\"), he pinched me and said, \"Oh,\\nthen! Now! Who are you! YOU wouldn\\'t like it, I think? What does she\\nmake a sham for, and pretend to give me money, and take it away\\nagain? Why do you call it my allowance, and never let me spend it?\"\\nThese exasperating questions so inflamed his mind and the minds of\\nOswald and Francis that they all pinched me at once, and in a\\ndreadfully expert way--screwing up such little pieces of my arms that\\nI could hardly forbear crying out. Felix, at the same time, stamped\\nupon my toes. And the Bond of Joy, who on account of always having\\nthe whole of his little income anticipated stood in fact pledged to\\nabstain from cakes as well as tobacco, so swelled with grief and rage\\nwhen we passed a pastry-cook\\'s shop that he terrified me by becoming\\npurple. I never underwent so much, both in body and mind, in the\\ncourse of a walk with young people as from these unnaturally\\nconstrained children when they paid me the compliment of being\\nnatural.\\n\\nI was glad when we came to the brickmaker\\'s house, though it was one\\nof a cluster of wretched hovels in a brick-field, with pigsties close\\nto the broken windows and miserable little gardens before the doors\\ngrowing nothing but stagnant pools. Here and there an old tub was put\\nto catch the droppings of rain-water from a roof, or they were banked\\nup with mud into a little pond like a large dirt-pie. At the doors\\nand windows some men and women lounged or prowled about, and took\\nlittle notice of us except to laugh to one another or to say\\nsomething as we passed about gentlefolks minding their own business\\nand not troubling their heads and muddying their shoes with coming to\\nlook after other people\\'s.\\n\\nMrs. Pardiggle, leading the way with a great show of moral\\ndetermination and talking with much volubility about the untidy\\nhabits of the people (though I doubted if the best of us could have\\nbeen tidy in such a place), conducted us into a cottage at the\\nfarthest corner, the ground-floor room of which we nearly filled.\\nBesides ourselves, there were in this damp, offensive room a woman\\nwith a black eye, nursing a poor little gasping baby by the fire; a\\nman, all stained with clay and mud and looking very dissipated, lying\\nat full length on the ground, smoking a pipe; a powerful young man\\nfastening a collar on a dog; and a bold girl doing some kind of\\nwashing in very dirty water. They all looked up at us as we came in,\\nand the woman seemed to turn her face towards the fire as if to hide\\nher bruised eye; nobody gave us any welcome.\\n\\n\"Well, my friends,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, but her voice had not a\\nfriendly sound, I thought; it was much too business-like and\\nsystematic. \"How do you do, all of you? I am here again. I told you,\\nyou couldn\\'t tire me, you know. I am fond of hard work, and am true\\nto my word.\"\\n\\n\"There an\\'t,\" growled the man on the floor, whose head rested on his\\nhand as he stared at us, \"any more on you to come in, is there?\"\\n\\n\"No, my friend,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, seating herself on one stool\\nand knocking down another. \"We are all here.\"\\n\\n\"Because I thought there warn\\'t enough of you, perhaps?\" said the\\nman, with his pipe between his lips as he looked round upon us.\\n\\nThe young man and the girl both laughed. Two friends of the young\\nman, whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with\\ntheir hands in their pockets, echoed the laugh noisily.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t tire me, good people,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle to these\\nlatter. \"I enjoy hard work, and the harder you make mine, the better\\nI like it.\"\\n\\n\"Then make it easy for her!\" growled the man upon the floor. \"I wants\\nit done, and over. I wants a end of these liberties took with my\\nplace. I wants an end of being drawed like a badger. Now you\\'re\\na-going to poll-pry and question according to custom--I know what\\nyou\\'re a-going to be up to. Well! You haven\\'t got no occasion to be\\nup to it. I\\'ll save you the trouble. Is my daughter a-washin? Yes,\\nshe IS a-washin. Look at the water. Smell it! That\\'s wot we drinks.\\nHow do you like it, and what do you think of gin instead! An\\'t my\\nplace dirty? Yes, it is dirty--it\\'s nat\\'rally dirty, and it\\'s\\nnat\\'rally onwholesome; and we\\'ve had five dirty and onwholesome\\nchildren, as is all dead infants, and so much the better for them,\\nand for us besides. Have I read the little book wot you left? No, I\\nan\\'t read the little book wot you left. There an\\'t nobody here as\\nknows how to read it; and if there wos, it wouldn\\'t be suitable to\\nme. It\\'s a book fit for a babby, and I\\'m not a babby. If you was to\\nleave me a doll, I shouldn\\'t nuss it. How have I been conducting of\\nmyself? Why, I\\'ve been drunk for three days; and I\\'da been drunk four\\nif I\\'da had the money. Don\\'t I never mean for to go to church? No, I\\ndon\\'t never mean for to go to church. I shouldn\\'t be expected there,\\nif I did; the beadle\\'s too gen-teel for me. And how did my wife get\\nthat black eye? Why, I give it her; and if she says I didn\\'t, she\\'s a\\nlie!\"\\n\\nHe had pulled his pipe out of his mouth to say all this, and he now\\nturned over on his other side and smoked again. Mrs. Pardiggle, who\\nhad been regarding him through her spectacles with a forcible\\ncomposure, calculated, I could not help thinking, to increase his\\nantagonism, pulled out a good book as if it were a constable\\'s staff\\nand took the whole family into custody. I mean into religious\\ncustody, of course; but she really did it as if she were an\\ninexorable moral policeman carrying them all off to a station-house.\\n\\nAda and I were very uncomfortable. We both felt intrusive and out of\\nplace, and we both thought that Mrs. Pardiggle would have got on\\ninfinitely better if she had not had such a mechanical way of taking\\npossession of people. The children sulked and stared; the family took\\nno notice of us whatever, except when the young man made the dog\\nbark, which he usually did when Mrs. Pardiggle was most emphatic. We\\nboth felt painfully sensible that between us and these people there\\nwas an iron barrier which could not be removed by our new friend. By\\nwhom or how it could be removed, we did not know, but we knew that.\\nEven what she read and said seemed to us to be ill-chosen for such\\nauditors, if it had been imparted ever so modestly and with ever so\\nmuch tact. As to the little book to which the man on the floor had\\nreferred, we acquired a knowledge of it afterwards, and Mr. Jarndyce\\nsaid he doubted if Robinson Crusoe could have read it, though he had\\nhad no other on his desolate island.\\n\\nWe were much relieved, under these circumstances, when Mrs. Pardiggle\\nleft off.\\n\\nThe man on the floor, then turning his head round again, said\\nmorosely, \"Well! You\\'ve done, have you?\"\\n\\n\"For to-day, I have, my friend. But I am never fatigued. I shall come\\nto you again in your regular order,\" returned Mrs. Pardiggle with\\ndemonstrative cheerfulness.\\n\\n\"So long as you goes now,\" said he, folding his arms and shutting his\\neyes with an oath, \"you may do wot you like!\"\\n\\nMrs. Pardiggle accordingly rose and made a little vortex in the\\nconfined room from which the pipe itself very narrowly escaped.\\nTaking one of her young family in each hand, and telling the others\\nto follow closely, and expressing her hope that the brickmaker and\\nall his house would be improved when she saw them next, she then\\nproceeded to another cottage. I hope it is not unkind in me to say\\nthat she certainly did make, in this as in everything else, a show\\nthat was not conciliatory of doing charity by wholesale and of\\ndealing in it to a large extent.\\n\\nShe supposed that we were following her, but as soon as the space was\\nleft clear, we approached the woman sitting by the fire to ask if the\\nbaby were ill.\\n\\nShe only looked at it as it lay on her lap. We had observed before\\nthat when she looked at it she covered her discoloured eye with her\\nhand, as though she wished to separate any association with noise and\\nviolence and ill treatment from the poor little child.\\n\\nAda, whose gentle heart was moved by its appearance, bent down to\\ntouch its little face. As she did so, I saw what happened and drew\\nher back. The child died.\\n\\n\"Oh, Esther!\" cried Ada, sinking on her knees beside it. \"Look here!\\nOh, Esther, my love, the little thing! The suffering, quiet, pretty\\nlittle thing! I am so sorry for it. I am so sorry for the mother. I\\nnever saw a sight so pitiful as this before! Oh, baby, baby!\"\\n\\nSuch compassion, such gentleness, as that with which she bent down\\nweeping and put her hand upon the mother\\'s might have softened any\\nmother\\'s heart that ever beat. The woman at first gazed at her in\\nastonishment and then burst into tears.\\n\\nPresently I took the light burden from her lap, did what I could to\\nmake the baby\\'s rest the prettier and gentler, laid it on a shelf,\\nand covered it with my own handkerchief. We tried to comfort the\\nmother, and we whispered to her what Our Saviour said of children.\\nShe answered nothing, but sat weeping--weeping very much.\\n\\nWhen I turned, I found that the young man had taken out the dog and\\nwas standing at the door looking in upon us with dry eyes, but quiet.\\nThe girl was quiet too and sat in a corner looking on the ground. The\\nman had risen. He still smoked his pipe with an air of defiance, but\\nhe was silent.\\n\\nAn ugly woman, very poorly clothed, hurried in while I was glancing\\nat them, and coming straight up to the mother, said, \"Jenny! Jenny!\"\\nThe mother rose on being so addressed and fell upon the woman\\'s neck.\\n\\nShe also had upon her face and arms the marks of ill usage. She had\\nno kind of grace about her, but the grace of sympathy; but when she\\ncondoled with the woman, and her own tears fell, she wanted no\\nbeauty. I say condoled, but her only words were \"Jenny! Jenny!\" All\\nthe rest was in the tone in which she said them.\\n\\nI thought it very touching to see these two women, coarse and shabby\\nand beaten, so united; to see what they could be to one another; to\\nsee how they felt for one another, how the heart of each to each was\\nsoftened by the hard trials of their lives. I think the best side of\\nsuch people is almost hidden from us. What the poor are to the poor\\nis little known, excepting to themselves and God.\\n\\nWe felt it better to withdraw and leave them uninterrupted. We stole\\nout quietly and without notice from any one except the man. He was\\nleaning against the wall near the door, and finding that there was\\nscarcely room for us to pass, went out before us. He seemed to want\\nto hide that he did this on our account, but we perceived that he\\ndid, and thanked him. He made no answer.\\n\\nAda was so full of grief all the way home, and Richard, whom we found\\nat home, was so distressed to see her in tears (though he said to me,\\nwhen she was not present, how beautiful it was too!), that we\\narranged to return at night with some little comforts and repeat our\\nvisit at the brick-maker\\'s house. We said as little as we could to\\nMr. Jarndyce, but the wind changed directly.\\n\\nRichard accompanied us at night to the scene of our morning\\nexpedition. On our way there, we had to pass a noisy drinking-house,\\nwhere a number of men were flocking about the door. Among them, and\\nprominent in some dispute, was the father of the little child. At a\\nshort distance, we passed the young man and the dog, in congenial\\ncompany. The sister was standing laughing and talking with some other\\nyoung women at the corner of the row of cottages, but she seemed\\nashamed and turned away as we went by.\\n\\nWe left our escort within sight of the brickmaker\\'s dwelling and\\nproceeded by ourselves. When we came to the door, we found the woman\\nwho had brought such consolation with her standing there looking\\nanxiously out.\\n\\n\"It\\'s you, young ladies, is it?\" she said in a whisper. \"I\\'m\\na-watching for my master. My heart\\'s in my mouth. If he was to catch\\nme away from home, he\\'d pretty near murder me.\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean your husband?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Yes, miss, my master. Jenny\\'s asleep, quite worn out. She\\'s scarcely\\nhad the child off her lap, poor thing, these seven days and nights,\\nexcept when I\\'ve been able to take it for a minute or two.\"\\n\\nAs she gave way for us, she went softly in and put what we had\\nbrought near the miserable bed on which the mother slept. No effort\\nhad been made to clean the room--it seemed in its nature almost\\nhopeless of being clean; but the small waxen form from which so much\\nsolemnity diffused itself had been composed afresh, and washed, and\\nneatly dressed in some fragments of white linen; and on my\\nhandkerchief, which still covered the poor baby, a little bunch of\\nsweet herbs had been laid by the same rough, scarred hands, so\\nlightly, so tenderly!\\n\\n\"May heaven reward you!\" we said to her. \"You are a good woman.\"\\n\\n\"Me, young ladies?\" she returned with surprise. \"Hush! Jenny, Jenny!\"\\n\\nThe mother had moaned in her sleep and moved. The sound of the\\nfamiliar voice seemed to calm her again. She was quiet once more.\\n\\nHow little I thought, when I raised my handkerchief to look upon the\\ntiny sleeper underneath and seemed to see a halo shine around the\\nchild through Ada\\'s drooping hair as her pity bent her head--how\\nlittle I thought in whose unquiet bosom that handkerchief would come\\nto lie after covering the motionless and peaceful breast! I only\\nthought that perhaps the Angel of the child might not be all\\nunconscious of the woman who replaced it with so compassionate a\\nhand; not all unconscious of her presently, when we had taken leave,\\nand left her at the door, by turns looking, and listening in terror\\nfor herself, and saying in her old soothing manner, \"Jenny, Jenny!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know how it is I seem to be always writing about myself. I\\nmean all the time to write about other people, and I try to think\\nabout myself as little as possible, and I am sure, when I find myself\\ncoming into the story again, I am really vexed and say, \"Dear, dear,\\nyou tiresome little creature, I wish you wouldn\\'t!\" but it is all of\\nno use. I hope any one who may read what I write will understand that\\nif these pages contain a great deal about me, I can only suppose it\\nmust be because I have really something to do with them and can\\'t be\\nkept out.\\n\\nMy darling and I read together, and worked, and practised, and found\\nso much employment for our time that the winter days flew by us like\\nbright-winged birds. Generally in the afternoons, and always in the\\nevenings, Richard gave us his company. Although he was one of the\\nmost restless creatures in the world, he certainly was very fond of\\nour society.\\n\\nHe was very, very, very fond of Ada. I mean it, and I had better say\\nit at once. I had never seen any young people falling in love before,\\nbut I found them out quite soon. I could not say so, of course, or\\nshow that I knew anything about it. On the contrary, I was so demure\\nand used to seem so unconscious that sometimes I considered within\\nmyself while I was sitting at work whether I was not growing quite\\ndeceitful.\\n\\nBut there was no help for it. All I had to do was to be quiet, and I\\nwas as quiet as a mouse. They were as quiet as mice too, so far as\\nany words were concerned, but the innocent manner in which they\\nrelied more and more upon me as they took more and more to one\\nanother was so charming that I had great difficulty in not showing\\nhow it interested me.\\n\\n\"Our dear little old woman is such a capital old woman,\" Richard\\nwould say, coming up to meet me in the garden early, with his\\npleasant laugh and perhaps the least tinge of a blush, \"that I can\\'t\\nget on without her. Before I begin my harum-scarum day--grinding away\\nat those books and instruments and then galloping up hill and down\\ndale, all the country round, like a highwayman--it does me so much\\ngood to come and have a steady walk with our comfortable friend, that\\nhere I am again!\"\\n\\n\"You know, Dame Durden, dear,\" Ada would say at night, with her head\\nupon my shoulder and the firelight shining in her thoughtful eyes, \"I\\ndon\\'t want to talk when we come upstairs here. Only to sit a little\\nwhile thinking, with your dear face for company, and to hear the wind\\nand remember the poor sailors at sea--\"\\n\\nAh! Perhaps Richard was going to be a sailor. We had talked it over\\nvery often now, and there was some talk of gratifying the inclination\\nof his childhood for the sea. Mr. Jarndyce had written to a relation\\nof the family, a great Sir Leicester Dedlock, for his interest in\\nRichard\\'s favour, generally; and Sir Leicester had replied in a\\ngracious manner that he would be happy to advance the prospects of\\nthe young gentleman if it should ever prove to be within his power,\\nwhich was not at all probable, and that my Lady sent her compliments\\nto the young gentleman (to whom she perfectly remembered that she was\\nallied by remote consanguinity) and trusted that he would ever do his\\nduty in any honourable profession to which he might devote himself.\\n\\n\"So I apprehend it\\'s pretty clear,\" said Richard to me, \"that I shall\\nhave to work my own way. Never mind! Plenty of people have had to do\\nthat before now, and have done it. I only wish I had the command of a\\nclipping privateer to begin with and could carry off the Chancellor\\nand keep him on short allowance until he gave judgment in our cause.\\nHe\\'d find himself growing thin, if he didn\\'t look sharp!\"\\n\\nWith a buoyancy and hopefulness and a gaiety that hardly ever\\nflagged, Richard had a carelessness in his character that quite\\nperplexed me, principally because he mistook it, in such a very odd\\nway, for prudence. It entered into all his calculations about money\\nin a singular manner which I don\\'t think I can better explain than by\\nreverting for a moment to our loan to Mr. Skimpole.\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce had ascertained the amount, either from Mr. Skimpole\\nhimself or from Coavinses, and had placed the money in my hands with\\ninstructions to me to retain my own part of it and hand the rest to\\nRichard. The number of little acts of thoughtless expenditure which\\nRichard justified by the recovery of his ten pounds, and the number\\nof times he talked to me as if he had saved or realized that amount,\\nwould form a sum in simple addition.\\n\\n\"My prudent Mother Hubbard, why not?\" he said to me when he wanted,\\nwithout the least consideration, to bestow five pounds on the\\nbrickmaker. \"I made ten pounds, clear, out of Coavinses\\' business.\"\\n\\n\"How was that?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Why, I got rid of ten pounds which I was quite content to get rid of\\nand never expected to see any more. You don\\'t deny that?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Very well! Then I came into possession of ten pounds--\"\\n\\n\"The same ten pounds,\" I hinted.\\n\\n\"That has nothing to do with it!\" returned Richard. \"I have got ten\\npounds more than I expected to have, and consequently I can afford to\\nspend it without being particular.\"\\n\\nIn exactly the same way, when he was persuaded out of the sacrifice\\nof these five pounds by being convinced that it would do no good, he\\ncarried that sum to his credit and drew upon it.\\n\\n\"Let me see!\" he would say. \"I saved five pounds out of the\\nbrickmaker\\'s affair, so if I have a good rattle to London and back in\\na post-chaise and put that down at four pounds, I shall have saved\\none. And it\\'s a very good thing to save one, let me tell you: a penny\\nsaved is a penny got!\"\\n\\nI believe Richard\\'s was as frank and generous a nature as there\\npossibly can be. He was ardent and brave, and in the midst of all his\\nwild restlessness, was so gentle that I knew him like a brother in a\\nfew weeks. His gentleness was natural to him and would have shown\\nitself abundantly even without Ada\\'s influence; but with it, he\\nbecame one of the most winning of companions, always so ready to be\\ninterested and always so happy, sanguine, and light-hearted. I am\\nsure that I, sitting with them, and walking with them, and talking\\nwith them, and noticing from day to day how they went on, falling\\ndeeper and deeper in love, and saying nothing about it, and each\\nshyly thinking that this love was the greatest of secrets, perhaps\\nnot yet suspected even by the other--I am sure that I was scarcely\\nless enchanted than they were and scarcely less pleased with the\\npretty dream.\\n\\nWe were going on in this way, when one morning at breakfast Mr.\\nJarndyce received a letter, and looking at the superscription, said,\\n\"From Boythorn? Aye, aye!\" and opened and read it with evident\\npleasure, announcing to us in a parenthesis when he was about\\nhalf-way through, that Boythorn was \"coming down\" on a visit. Now who\\nwas Boythorn, we all thought. And I dare say we all thought too--I am\\nsure I did, for one--would Boythorn at all interfere with what was\\ngoing forward?\\n\\n\"I went to school with this fellow, Lawrence Boythorn,\" said Mr.\\nJarndyce, tapping the letter as he laid it on the table, \"more than\\nfive and forty years ago. He was then the most impetuous boy in the\\nworld, and he is now the most impetuous man. He was then the loudest\\nboy in the world, and he is now the loudest man. He was then the\\nheartiest and sturdiest boy in the world, and he is now the heartiest\\nand sturdiest man. He is a tremendous fellow.\"\\n\\n\"In stature, sir?\" asked Richard.\\n\\n\"Pretty well, Rick, in that respect,\" said Mr. Jarndyce; \"being some\\nten years older than I and a couple of inches taller, with his head\\nthrown back like an old soldier, his stalwart chest squared, his\\nhands like a clean blacksmith\\'s, and his lungs! There\\'s no simile for\\nhis lungs. Talking, laughing, or snoring, they make the beams of the\\nhouse shake.\"\\n\\nAs Mr. Jarndyce sat enjoying the image of his friend Boythorn, we\\nobserved the favourable omen that there was not the least indication\\nof any change in the wind.\\n\\n\"But it\\'s the inside of the man, the warm heart of the man, the\\npassion of the man, the fresh blood of the man, Rick--and Ada, and\\nlittle Cobweb too, for you are all interested in a visitor--that I\\nspeak of,\" he pursued. \"His language is as sounding as his voice. He\\nis always in extremes, perpetually in the superlative degree. In his\\ncondemnation he is all ferocity. You might suppose him to be an ogre\\nfrom what he says, and I believe he has the reputation of one with\\nsome people. There! I tell you no more of him beforehand. You must\\nnot be surprised to see him take me under his protection, for he has\\nnever forgotten that I was a low boy at school and that our\\nfriendship began in his knocking two of my head tyrant\\'s teeth out\\n(he says six) before breakfast. Boythorn and his man,\" to me, \"will\\nbe here this afternoon, my dear.\"\\n\\nI took care that the necessary preparations were made for Mr.\\nBoythorn\\'s reception, and we looked forward to his arrival with some\\ncuriosity. The afternoon wore away, however, and he did not appear.\\nThe dinner-hour arrived, and still he did not appear. The dinner was\\nput back an hour, and we were sitting round the fire with no light\\nbut the blaze when the hall-door suddenly burst open and the hall\\nresounded with these words, uttered with the greatest vehemence and\\nin a stentorian tone: \"We have been misdirected, Jarndyce, by a most\\nabandoned ruffian, who told us to take the turning to the right\\ninstead of to the left. He is the most intolerable scoundrel on the\\nface of the earth. His father must have been a most consummate\\nvillain, ever to have such a son. I would have had that fellow shot\\nwithout the least remorse!\"\\n\\n\"Did he do it on purpose?\" Mr. Jarndyce inquired.\\n\\n\"I have not the slightest doubt that the scoundrel has passed his\\nwhole existence in misdirecting travellers!\" returned the other. \"By\\nmy soul, I thought him the worst-looking dog I had ever beheld when\\nhe was telling me to take the turning to the right. And yet I stood\\nbefore that fellow face to face and didn\\'t knock his brains out!\"\\n\\n\"Teeth, you mean?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, really making the whole\\nhouse vibrate. \"What, you have not forgotten it yet! Ha, ha, ha! And\\nthat was another most consummate vagabond! By my soul, the\\ncountenance of that fellow when he was a boy was the blackest image\\nof perfidy, cowardice, and cruelty ever set up as a scarecrow in a\\nfield of scoundrels. If I were to meet that most unparalleled despot\\nin the streets to-morrow, I would fell him like a rotten tree!\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"Now, will you come\\nupstairs?\"\\n\\n\"By my soul, Jarndyce,\" returned his guest, who seemed to refer to\\nhis watch, \"if you had been married, I would have turned back at the\\ngarden-gate and gone away to the remotest summits of the Himalaya\\nMountains sooner than I would have presented myself at this\\nunseasonable hour.\"\\n\\n\"Not quite so far, I hope?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"By my life and honour, yes!\" cried the visitor. \"I wouldn\\'t be\\nguilty of the audacious insolence of keeping a lady of the house\\nwaiting all this time for any earthly consideration. I would\\ninfinitely rather destroy myself--infinitely rather!\"\\n\\nTalking thus, they went upstairs, and presently we heard him in his\\nbedroom thundering \"Ha, ha, ha!\" and again \"Ha, ha, ha!\" until the\\nflattest echo in the neighbourhood seemed to catch the contagion and\\nto laugh as enjoyingly as he did or as we did when we heard him\\nlaugh.\\n\\nWe all conceived a prepossession in his favour, for there was a\\nsterling quality in this laugh, and in his vigorous, healthy voice,\\nand in the roundness and fullness with which he uttered every word he\\nspoke, and in the very fury of his superlatives, which seemed to go\\noff like blank cannons and hurt nothing. But we were hardly prepared\\nto have it so confirmed by his appearance when Mr. Jarndyce presented\\nhim. He was not only a very handsome old gentleman--upright and\\nstalwart as he had been described to us--with a massive grey head, a\\nfine composure of face when silent, a figure that might have become\\ncorpulent but for his being so continually in earnest that he gave it\\nno rest, and a chin that might have subsided into a double chin but\\nfor the vehement emphasis in which it was constantly required to\\nassist; but he was such a true gentleman in his manner, so\\nchivalrously polite, his face was lighted by a smile of so much\\nsweetness and tenderness, and it seemed so plain that he had nothing\\nto hide, but showed himself exactly as he was--incapable, as Richard\\nsaid, of anything on a limited scale, and firing away with those\\nblank great guns because he carried no small arms whatever--that\\nreally I could not help looking at him with equal pleasure as he sat\\nat dinner, whether he smilingly conversed with Ada and me, or was led\\nby Mr. Jarndyce into some great volley of superlatives, or threw up\\nhis head like a bloodhound and gave out that tremendous \"Ha, ha, ha!\"\\n\\n\"You have brought your bird with you, I suppose?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"By heaven, he is the most astonishing bird in Europe!\" replied the\\nother. \"He IS the most wonderful creature! I wouldn\\'t take ten\\nthousand guineas for that bird. I have left an annuity for his sole\\nsupport in case he should outlive me. He is, in sense and attachment,\\na phenomenon. And his father before him was one of the most\\nastonishing birds that ever lived!\"\\n\\nThe subject of this laudation was a very little canary, who was so\\ntame that he was brought down by Mr. Boythorn\\'s man, on his\\nforefinger, and after taking a gentle flight round the room, alighted\\non his master\\'s head. To hear Mr. Boythorn presently expressing the\\nmost implacable and passionate sentiments, with this fragile mite of\\na creature quietly perched on his forehead, was to have a good\\nillustration of his character, I thought.\\n\\n\"By my soul, Jarndyce,\" he said, very gently holding up a bit of\\nbread to the canary to peck at, \"if I were in your place I would\\nseize every master in Chancery by the throat to-morrow morning and\\nshake him until his money rolled out of his pockets and his bones\\nrattled in his skin. I would have a settlement out of somebody, by\\nfair means or by foul. If you would empower me to do it, I would do\\nit for you with the greatest satisfaction!\" (All this time the very\\nsmall canary was eating out of his hand.)\\n\\n\"I thank you, Lawrence, but the suit is hardly at such a point at\\npresent,\" returned Mr. Jarndyce, laughing, \"that it would be greatly\\nadvanced even by the legal process of shaking the bench and the whole\\nbar.\"\\n\\n\"There never was such an infernal cauldron as that Chancery on the\\nface of the earth!\" said Mr. Boythorn. \"Nothing but a mine below it\\non a busy day in term time, with all its records, rules, and\\nprecedents collected in it and every functionary belonging to it\\nalso, high and low, upward and downward, from its son the\\nAccountant-General to its father the Devil, and the whole blown to\\natoms with ten thousand hundredweight of gunpowder, would reform it\\nin the least!\"\\n\\nIt was impossible not to laugh at the energetic gravity with which he\\nrecommended this strong measure of reform. When we laughed, he threw\\nup his head and shook his broad chest, and again the whole country\\nseemed to echo to his \"Ha, ha, ha!\" It had not the least effect in\\ndisturbing the bird, whose sense of security was complete and who\\nhopped about the table with its quick head now on this side and now\\non that, turning its bright sudden eye on its master as if he were no\\nmore than another bird.\\n\\n\"But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right of\\nway?\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"You are not free from the toils of the law\\nyourself!\"\\n\\n\"The fellow has brought actions against ME for trespass, and I have\\nbrought actions against HIM for trespass,\" returned Mr. Boythorn. \"By\\nheaven, he is the proudest fellow breathing. It is morally impossible\\nthat his name can be Sir Leicester. It must be Sir Lucifer.\"\\n\\n\"Complimentary to our distant relation!\" said my guardian laughingly\\nto Ada and Richard.\\n\\n\"I would beg Miss Clare\\'s pardon and Mr. Carstone\\'s pardon,\" resumed\\nour visitor, \"if I were not reassured by seeing in the fair face of\\nthe lady and the smile of the gentleman that it is quite unnecessary\\nand that they keep their distant relation at a comfortable distance.\"\\n\\n\"Or he keeps us,\" suggested Richard.\\n\\n\"By my soul,\" exclaimed Mr. Boythorn, suddenly firing another volley,\\n\"that fellow is, and his father was, and his grandfather was, the\\nmost stiff-necked, arrogant imbecile, pig-headed numskull, ever, by\\nsome inexplicable mistake of Nature, born in any station of life but\\na walking-stick\\'s! The whole of that family are the most solemnly\\nconceited and consummate blockheads! But it\\'s no matter; he should\\nnot shut up my path if he were fifty baronets melted into one and\\nliving in a hundred Chesney Wolds, one within another, like the ivory\\nballs in a Chinese carving. The fellow, by his agent, or secretary,\\nor somebody, writes to me \\'Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, presents\\nhis compliments to Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, and has to call his\\nattention to the fact that the green pathway by the old\\nparsonage-house, now the property of Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, is Sir\\nLeicester\\'s right of way, being in fact a portion of the park of\\nChesney Wold, and that Sir Leicester finds it convenient to close up\\nthe same.\\' I write to the fellow, \\'Mr. Lawrence Boythorn presents his\\ncompliments to Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, and has to call HIS\\nattention to the fact that he totally denies the whole of Sir\\nLeicester Dedlock\\'s positions on every possible subject and has to\\nadd, in reference to closing up the pathway, that he will be glad to\\nsee the man who may undertake to do it.\\' The fellow sends a most\\nabandoned villain with one eye to construct a gateway. I play upon\\nthat execrable scoundrel with a fire-engine until the breath is\\nnearly driven out of his body. The fellow erects a gate in the night.\\nI chop it down and burn it in the morning. He sends his myrmidons to\\ncome over the fence and pass and repass. I catch them in humane man\\ntraps, fire split peas at their legs, play upon them with the\\nengine--resolve to free mankind from the insupportable burden of the\\nexistence of those lurking ruffians. He brings actions for trespass;\\nI bring actions for trespass. He brings actions for assault and\\nbattery; I defend them and continue to assault and batter. Ha, ha,\\nha!\"\\n\\nTo hear him say all this with unimaginable energy, one might have\\nthought him the angriest of mankind. To see him at the very same\\ntime, looking at the bird now perched upon his thumb and softly\\nsmoothing its feathers with his forefinger, one might have thought\\nhim the gentlest. To hear him laugh and see the broad good nature of\\nhis face then, one might have supposed that he had not a care in the\\nworld, or a dispute, or a dislike, but that his whole existence was a\\nsummer joke.\\n\\n\"No, no,\" he said, \"no closing up of my paths by any Dedlock! Though\\nI willingly confess,\" here he softened in a moment, \"that Lady\\nDedlock is the most accomplished lady in the world, to whom I would\\ndo any homage that a plain gentleman, and no baronet with a head\\nseven hundred years thick, may. A man who joined his regiment at\\ntwenty and within a week challenged the most imperious and\\npresumptuous coxcomb of a commanding officer that ever drew the\\nbreath of life through a tight waist--and got broke for it--is not\\nthe man to be walked over by all the Sir Lucifers, dead or alive,\\nlocked or unlocked. Ha, ha, ha!\"\\n\\n\"Nor the man to allow his junior to be walked over either?\" said my\\nguardian.\\n\\n\"Most assuredly not!\" said Mr. Boythorn, clapping him on the shoulder\\nwith an air of protection that had something serious in it, though he\\nlaughed. \"He will stand by the low boy, always. Jarndyce, you may\\nrely upon him! But speaking of this trespass--with apologies to Miss\\nClare and Miss Summerson for the length at which I have pursued so\\ndry a subject--is there nothing for me from your men Kenge and\\nCarboy?\"\\n\\n\"I think not, Esther?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Nothing, guardian.\"\\n\\n\"Much obliged!\" said Mr. Boythorn. \"Had no need to ask, after even my\\nslight experience of Miss Summerson\\'s forethought for every one about\\nher.\" (They all encouraged me; they were determined to do it.) \"I\\ninquired because, coming from Lincolnshire, I of course have not yet\\nbeen in town, and I thought some letters might have been sent down\\nhere. I dare say they will report progress to-morrow morning.\"\\n\\nI saw him so often in the course of the evening, which passed very\\npleasantly, contemplate Richard and Ada with an interest and a\\nsatisfaction that made his fine face remarkably agreeable as he sat\\nat a little distance from the piano listening to the music--and he\\nhad small occasion to tell us that he was passionately fond of music,\\nfor his face showed it--that I asked my guardian as we sat at the\\nbackgammon board whether Mr. Boythorn had ever been married.\\n\\n\"No,\" said he. \"No.\"\\n\\n\"But he meant to be!\" said I.\\n\\n\"How did you find out that?\" he returned with a smile. \"Why,\\nguardian,\" I explained, not without reddening a little at hazarding\\nwhat was in my thoughts, \"there is something so tender in his manner,\\nafter all, and he is so very courtly and gentle to us, and--\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce directed his eyes to where he was sitting as I have just\\ndescribed him.\\n\\nI said no more.\\n\\n\"You are right, little woman,\" he answered. \"He was all but married\\nonce. Long ago. And once.\"\\n\\n\"Did the lady die?\"\\n\\n\"No--but she died to him. That time has had its influence on all his\\nlater life. Would you suppose him to have a head and a heart full of\\nromance yet?\"\\n\\n\"I think, guardian, I might have supposed so. But it is easy to say\\nthat when you have told me so.\"\\n\\n\"He has never since been what he might have been,\" said Mr. Jarndyce,\\n\"and now you see him in his age with no one near him but his servant\\nand his little yellow friend. It\\'s your throw, my dear!\"\\n\\nI felt, from my guardian\\'s manner, that beyond this point I could not\\npursue the subject without changing the wind. I therefore forbore to\\nask any further questions. I was interested, but not curious. I\\nthought a little while about this old love story in the night, when I\\nwas awakened by Mr. Boythorn\\'s lusty snoring; and I tried to do that\\nvery difficult thing, imagine old people young again and invested\\nwith the graces of youth. But I fell asleep before I had succeeded,\\nand dreamed of the days when I lived in my godmother\\'s house. I am\\nnot sufficiently acquainted with such subjects to know whether it is\\nat all remarkable that I almost always dreamed of that period of my\\nlife.\\n\\nWith the morning there came a letter from Messrs. Kenge and Carboy to\\nMr. Boythorn informing him that one of their clerks would wait upon\\nhim at noon. As it was the day of the week on which I paid the bills,\\nand added up my books, and made all the household affairs as compact\\nas possible, I remained at home while Mr. Jarndyce, Ada, and Richard\\ntook advantage of a very fine day to make a little excursion, Mr.\\nBoythorn was to wait for Kenge and Carboy\\'s clerk and then was to go\\non foot to meet them on their return.\\n\\nWell! I was full of business, examining tradesmen\\'s books, adding up\\ncolumns, paying money, filing receipts, and I dare say making a great\\nbustle about it when Mr. Guppy was announced and shown in. I had had\\nsome idea that the clerk who was to be sent down might be the young\\ngentleman who had met me at the coach-office, and I was glad to see\\nhim, because he was associated with my present happiness.\\n\\nI scarcely knew him again, he was so uncommonly smart. He had an\\nentirely new suit of glossy clothes on, a shining hat, lilac-kid\\ngloves, a neckerchief of a variety of colours, a large hot-house\\nflower in his button-hole, and a thick gold ring on his little\\nfinger. Besides which, he quite scented the dining-room with\\nbear\\'s-grease and other perfumery. He looked at me with an attention\\nthat quite confused me when I begged him to take a seat until the\\nservant should return; and as he sat there crossing and uncrossing\\nhis legs in a corner, and I asked him if he had had a pleasant ride,\\nand hoped that Mr. Kenge was well, I never looked at him, but I found\\nhim looking at me in the same scrutinizing and curious way.\\n\\nWhen the request was brought to him that he would go upstairs to Mr.\\nBoythorn\\'s room, I mentioned that he would find lunch prepared for\\nhim when he came down, of which Mr. Jarndyce hoped he would partake.\\nHe said with some embarrassment, holding the handle of the door,\\n\"Shall I have the honour of finding you here, miss?\" I replied yes, I\\nshould be there; and he went out with a bow and another look.\\n\\nI thought him only awkward and shy, for he was evidently much\\nembarrassed; and I fancied that the best thing I could do would be to\\nwait until I saw that he had everything he wanted and then to leave\\nhim to himself. The lunch was soon brought, but it remained for some\\ntime on the table. The interview with Mr. Boythorn was a long one,\\nand a stormy one too, I should think, for although his room was at\\nsome distance I heard his loud voice rising every now and then like a\\nhigh wind, and evidently blowing perfect broadsides of denunciation.\\n\\nAt last Mr. Guppy came back, looking something the worse for the\\nconference. \"My eye, miss,\" he said in a low voice, \"he\\'s a Tartar!\"\\n\\n\"Pray take some refreshment, sir,\" said I.\\n\\nMr. Guppy sat down at the table and began nervously sharpening the\\ncarving-knife on the carving-fork, still looking at me (as I felt\\nquite sure without looking at him) in the same unusual manner. The\\nsharpening lasted so long that at last I felt a kind of obligation on\\nme to raise my eyes in order that I might break the spell under which\\nhe seemed to labour, of not being able to leave off.\\n\\nHe immediately looked at the dish and began to carve.\\n\\n\"What will you take yourself, miss? You\\'ll take a morsel of\\nsomething?\"\\n\\n\"No, thank you,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Shan\\'t I give you a piece of anything at all, miss?\" said Mr. Guppy,\\nhurriedly drinking off a glass of wine.\\n\\n\"Nothing, thank you,\" said I. \"I have only waited to see that you\\nhave everything you want. Is there anything I can order for you?\"\\n\\n\"No, I am much obliged to you, miss, I\\'m sure. I\\'ve everything that I\\ncan require to make me comfortable--at least I--not comfortable--I\\'m\\nnever that.\" He drank off two more glasses of wine, one after\\nanother.\\n\\nI thought I had better go.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, miss!\" said Mr. Guppy, rising when he saw me\\nrise. \"But would you allow me the favour of a minute\\'s private\\nconversation?\"\\n\\nNot knowing what to say, I sat down again.\\n\\n\"What follows is without prejudice, miss?\" said Mr. Guppy, anxiously\\nbringing a chair towards my table.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand what you mean,\" said I, wondering.\\n\\n\"It\\'s one of our law terms, miss. You won\\'t make any use of it to my\\ndetriment at Kenge and Carboy\\'s or elsewhere. If our conversation\\nshouldn\\'t lead to anything, I am to be as I was and am not to be\\nprejudiced in my situation or worldly prospects. In short, it\\'s in\\ntotal confidence.\"\\n\\n\"I am at a loss, sir,\" said I, \"to imagine what you can have to\\ncommunicate in total confidence to me, whom you have never seen but\\nonce; but I should be very sorry to do you any injury.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, miss. I\\'m sure of it--that\\'s quite sufficient.\" All this\\ntime Mr. Guppy was either planing his forehead with his handkerchief\\nor tightly rubbing the palm of his left hand with the palm of his\\nright. \"If you would excuse my taking another glass of wine, miss, I\\nthink it might assist me in getting on without a continual choke that\\ncannot fail to be mutually unpleasant.\"\\n\\nHe did so, and came back again. I took the opportunity of moving well\\nbehind my table.\\n\\n\"You wouldn\\'t allow me to offer you one, would you miss?\" said Mr.\\nGuppy, apparently refreshed.\\n\\n\"Not any,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Not half a glass?\" said Mr. Guppy. \"Quarter? No! Then, to proceed.\\nMy present salary, Miss Summerson, at Kenge and Carboy\\'s, is two\\npound a week. When I first had the happiness of looking upon you, it\\nwas one fifteen, and had stood at that figure for a lengthened\\nperiod. A rise of five has since taken place, and a further rise of\\nfive is guaranteed at the expiration of a term not exceeding twelve\\nmonths from the present date. My mother has a little property, which\\ntakes the form of a small life annuity, upon which she lives in an\\nindependent though unassuming manner in the Old Street Road. She is\\neminently calculated for a mother-in-law. She never interferes, is\\nall for peace, and her disposition easy. She has her failings--as who\\nhas not?--but I never knew her do it when company was present, at\\nwhich time you may freely trust her with wines, spirits, or malt\\nliquors. My own abode is lodgings at Penton Place, Pentonville. It is\\nlowly, but airy, open at the back, and considered one of the\\n\\'ealthiest outlets. Miss Summerson! In the mildest language, I adore\\nyou. Would you be so kind as to allow me (as I may say) to file a\\ndeclaration--to make an offer!\"\\n\\nMr. Guppy went down on his knees. I was well behind my table and not\\nmuch frightened. I said, \"Get up from that ridiculous position\\nimmediately, sir, or you will oblige me to break my implied promise\\nand ring the bell!\"\\n\\n\"Hear me out, miss!\" said Mr. Guppy, folding his hands.\\n\\n\"I cannot consent to hear another word, sir,\" I returned, \"Unless you\\nget up from the carpet directly and go and sit down at the table as\\nyou ought to do if you have any sense at all.\"\\n\\nHe looked piteously, but slowly rose and did so.\\n\\n\"Yet what a mockery it is, miss,\" he said with his hand upon his\\nheart and shaking his head at me in a melancholy manner over the\\ntray, \"to be stationed behind food at such a moment. The soul recoils\\nfrom food at such a moment, miss.\"\\n\\n\"I beg you to conclude,\" said I; \"you have asked me to hear you out,\\nand I beg you to conclude.\"\\n\\n\"I will, miss,\" said Mr. Guppy. \"As I love and honour, so likewise I\\nobey. Would that I could make thee the subject of that vow before the\\nshrine!\"\\n\\n\"That is quite impossible,\" said I, \"and entirely out of the\\nquestion.\"\\n\\n\"I am aware,\" said Mr. Guppy, leaning forward over the tray and\\nregarding me, as I again strangely felt, though my eyes were not\\ndirected to him, with his late intent look, \"I am aware that in a\\nworldly point of view, according to all appearances, my offer is a\\npoor one. But, Miss Summerson! Angel! No, don\\'t ring--I have been\\nbrought up in a sharp school and am accustomed to a variety of\\ngeneral practice. Though a young man, I have ferreted out evidence,\\ngot up cases, and seen lots of life. Blest with your hand, what means\\nmight I not find of advancing your interests and pushing your\\nfortunes! What might I not get to know, nearly concerning you? I know\\nnothing now, certainly; but what MIGHT I not if I had your\\nconfidence, and you set me on?\"\\n\\nI told him that he addressed my interest or what he supposed to be my\\ninterest quite as unsuccessfully as he addressed my inclination, and\\nhe would now understand that I requested him, if he pleased, to go\\naway immediately.\\n\\n\"Cruel miss,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"hear but another word! I think you\\nmust have seen that I was struck with those charms on the day when I\\nwaited at the Whytorseller. I think you must have remarked that I\\ncould not forbear a tribute to those charms when I put up the steps\\nof the \\'ackney-coach. It was a feeble tribute to thee, but it was\\nwell meant. Thy image has ever since been fixed in my breast. I have\\nwalked up and down of an evening opposite Jellyby\\'s house only to\\nlook upon the bricks that once contained thee. This out of to-day,\\nquite an unnecessary out so far as the attendance, which was its\\npretended object, went, was planned by me alone for thee alone. If I\\nspeak of interest, it is only to recommend myself and my respectful\\nwretchedness. Love was before it, and is before it.\"\\n\\n\"I should be pained, Mr. Guppy,\" said I, rising and putting my hand\\nupon the bell-rope, \"to do you or any one who was sincere the\\ninjustice of slighting any honest feeling, however disagreeably\\nexpressed. If you have really meant to give me a proof of your good\\nopinion, though ill-timed and misplaced, I feel that I ought to thank\\nyou. I have very little reason to be proud, and I am not proud. I\\nhope,\" I think I added, without very well knowing what I said, \"that\\nyou will now go away as if you had never been so exceedingly foolish\\nand attend to Messrs. Kenge and Carboy\\'s business.\"\\n\\n\"Half a minute, miss!\" cried Mr. Guppy, checking me as I was about to\\nring. \"This has been without prejudice?\"\\n\\n\"I will never mention it,\" said I, \"unless you should give me future\\noccasion to do so.\"\\n\\n\"A quarter of a minute, miss! In case you should think better at any\\ntime, however distant--THAT\\'S no consequence, for my feelings can\\nnever alter--of anything I have said, particularly what might I not\\ndo, Mr. William Guppy, eighty-seven, Penton Place, or if removed, or\\ndead (of blighted hopes or anything of that sort), care of Mrs.\\nGuppy, three hundred and two, Old Street Road, will be sufficient.\"\\n\\nI rang the bell, the servant came, and Mr. Guppy, laying his written\\ncard upon the table and making a dejected bow, departed. Raising my\\neyes as he went out, I once more saw him looking at me after he had\\npassed the door.\\n\\nI sat there for another hour or more, finishing my books and payments\\nand getting through plenty of business. Then I arranged my desk, and\\nput everything away, and was so composed and cheerful that I thought\\nI had quite dismissed this unexpected incident. But, when I went\\nupstairs to my own room, I surprised myself by beginning to laugh\\nabout it and then surprised myself still more by beginning to cry\\nabout it. In short, I was in a flutter for a little while and felt as\\nif an old chord had been more coarsely touched than it ever had been\\nsince the days of the dear old doll, long buried in the garden.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the eastern borders of Chancery Lane, that is to say, more\\nparticularly in Cook\\'s Court, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby,\\nlaw-stationer, pursues his lawful calling. In the shade of Cook\\'s\\nCourt, at most times a shady place, Mr. Snagsby has dealt in\\nall sorts of blank forms of legal process; in skins and rolls\\nof parchment; in paper--foolscap, brief, draft, brown, white,\\nwhitey-brown, and blotting; in stamps; in office-quills, pens,\\nink, India-rubber, pounce, pins, pencils, sealing-wax, and\\nwafers; in red tape and green ferret; in pocket-books, almanacs,\\ndiaries, and law lists; in string boxes, rulers, inkstands--glass\\nand leaden--pen-knives, scissors, bodkins, and other small\\noffice-cutlery; in short, in articles too numerous to mention, ever\\nsince he was out of his time and went into partnership with Peffer.\\nOn that occasion, Cook\\'s Court was in a manner revolutionized by the\\nnew inscription in fresh paint, PEFFER AND SNAGSBY, displacing the\\ntime-honoured and not easily to be deciphered legend PEFFER only. For\\nsmoke, which is the London ivy, had so wreathed itself round Peffer\\'s\\nname and clung to his dwelling-place that the affectionate parasite\\nquite overpowered the parent tree.\\n\\nPeffer is never seen in Cook\\'s Court now. He is not expected there,\\nfor he has been recumbent this quarter of a century in the churchyard\\nof St. Andrews, Holborn, with the waggons and hackney-coaches roaring\\npast him all the day and half the night like one great dragon. If he\\never steal forth when the dragon is at rest to air himself again in\\nCook\\'s Court until admonished to return by the crowing of the\\nsanguine cock in the cellar at the little dairy in Cursitor Street,\\nwhose ideas of daylight it would be curious to ascertain, since he\\nknows from his personal observation next to nothing about it--if\\nPeffer ever do revisit the pale glimpses of Cook\\'s Court, which no\\nlaw-stationer in the trade can positively deny, he comes invisibly,\\nand no one is the worse or wiser.\\n\\nIn his lifetime, and likewise in the period of Snagsby\\'s \"time\"\\nof seven long years, there dwelt with Peffer in the same\\nlaw-stationering premises a niece--a short, shrewd niece, something\\ntoo violently compressed about the waist, and with a sharp nose like\\na sharp autumn evening, inclining to be frosty towards the end. The\\nCook\\'s Courtiers had a rumour flying among them that the mother of\\nthis niece did, in her daughter\\'s childhood, moved by too jealous a\\nsolicitude that her figure should approach perfection, lace her\\nup every morning with her maternal foot against the bed-post for\\na stronger hold and purchase; and further, that she exhibited\\ninternally pints of vinegar and lemon-juice, which acids, they held,\\nhad mounted to the nose and temper of the patient. With whichsoever\\nof the many tongues of Rumour this frothy report originated, it\\neither never reached or never influenced the ears of young Snagsby,\\nwho, having wooed and won its fair subject on his arrival at man\\'s\\nestate, entered into two partnerships at once. So now, in Cook\\'s\\nCourt, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby and the niece are one; and the\\nniece still cherishes her figure, which, however tastes may differ,\\nis unquestionably so far precious that there is mighty little of it.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Snagsby are not only one bone and one flesh, but, to the\\nneighbours\\' thinking, one voice too. That voice, appearing to proceed\\nfrom Mrs. Snagsby alone, is heard in Cook\\'s Court very often. Mr.\\nSnagsby, otherwise than as he finds expression through these dulcet\\ntones, is rarely heard. He is a mild, bald, timid man with a shining\\nhead and a scrubby clump of black hair sticking out at the back. He\\ntends to meekness and obesity. As he stands at his door in Cook\\'s\\nCourt in his grey shop-coat and black calico sleeves, looking up at\\nthe clouds, or stands behind a desk in his dark shop with a heavy\\nflat ruler, snipping and slicing at sheepskin in company with his two\\n\\'prentices, he is emphatically a retiring and unassuming man. From\\nbeneath his feet, at such times, as from a shrill ghost unquiet in\\nits grave, there frequently arise complainings and lamentations in\\nthe voice already mentioned; and haply, on some occasions when these\\nreach a sharper pitch than usual, Mr. Snagsby mentions to the\\n\\'prentices, \"I think my little woman is a-giving it to Guster!\"\\n\\nThis proper name, so used by Mr. Snagsby, has before now sharpened\\nthe wit of the Cook\\'s Courtiers to remark that it ought to be the\\nname of Mrs. Snagsby, seeing that she might with great force and\\nexpression be termed a Guster, in compliment to her stormy character.\\nIt is, however, the possession, and the only possession except fifty\\nshillings per annum and a very small box indifferently filled with\\nclothing, of a lean young woman from a workhouse (by some supposed to\\nhave been christened Augusta) who, although she was farmed or\\ncontracted for during her growing time by an amiable benefactor of\\nhis species resident at Tooting, and cannot fail to have been\\ndeveloped under the most favourable circumstances, \"has fits,\" which\\nthe parish can\\'t account for.\\n\\nGuster, really aged three or four and twenty, but looking a round ten\\nyears older, goes cheap with this unaccountable drawback of fits, and\\nis so apprehensive of being returned on the hands of her patron saint\\nthat except when she is found with her head in the pail, or the sink,\\nor the copper, or the dinner, or anything else that happens to be\\nnear her at the time of her seizure, she is always at work. She is a\\nsatisfaction to the parents and guardians of the \\'prentices, who feel\\nthat there is little danger of her inspiring tender emotions in the\\nbreast of youth; she is a satisfaction to Mrs. Snagsby, who can\\nalways find fault with her; she is a satisfaction to Mr. Snagsby, who\\nthinks it a charity to keep her. The law-stationer\\'s establishment\\nis, in Guster\\'s eyes, a temple of plenty and splendour. She believes\\nthe little drawing-room upstairs, always kept, as one may say, with\\nits hair in papers and its pinafore on, to be the most elegant\\napartment in Christendom. The view it commands of Cook\\'s Court at one\\nend (not to mention a squint into Cursitor Street) and of Coavinses\\'\\nthe sheriff\\'s officer\\'s backyard at the other she regards as a\\nprospect of unequalled beauty. The portraits it displays in oil--and\\nplenty of it too--of Mr. Snagsby looking at Mrs. Snagsby and of Mrs.\\nSnagsby looking at Mr. Snagsby are in her eyes as achievements of\\nRaphael or Titian. Guster has some recompenses for her many\\nprivations.\\n\\nMr. Snagsby refers everything not in the practical mysteries of the\\nbusiness to Mrs. Snagsby. She manages the money, reproaches the\\ntax-gatherers, appoints the times and places of devotion on Sundays,\\nlicenses Mr. Snagsby\\'s entertainments, and acknowledges no\\nresponsibility as to what she thinks fit to provide for dinner,\\ninsomuch that she is the high standard of comparison among the\\nneighbouring wives a long way down Chancery Lane on both sides, and\\neven out in Holborn, who in any domestic passages of arms habitually\\ncall upon their husbands to look at the difference between their (the\\nwives\\') position and Mrs. Snagsby\\'s, and their (the husbands\\')\\nbehaviour and Mr. Snagsby\\'s. Rumour, always flying bat-like about\\nCook\\'s Court and skimming in and out at everybody\\'s windows, does say\\nthat Mrs. Snagsby is jealous and inquisitive and that Mr. Snagsby is\\nsometimes worried out of house and home, and that if he had the\\nspirit of a mouse he wouldn\\'t stand it. It is even observed that the\\nwives who quote him to their self-willed husbands as a shining\\nexample in reality look down upon him and that nobody does so with\\ngreater superciliousness than one particular lady whose lord is more\\nthan suspected of laying his umbrella on her as an instrument of\\ncorrection. But these vague whisperings may arise from Mr. Snagsby\\'s\\nbeing in his way rather a meditative and poetical man, loving to walk\\nin Staple Inn in the summer-time and to observe how countrified the\\nsparrows and the leaves are, also to lounge about the Rolls Yard of a\\nSunday afternoon and to remark (if in good spirits) that there were\\nold times once and that you\\'d find a stone coffin or two now under\\nthat chapel, he\\'ll be bound, if you was to dig for it. He solaces his\\nimagination, too, by thinking of the many Chancellors and Vices, and\\nMasters of the Rolls who are deceased; and he gets such a flavour of\\nthe country out of telling the two \\'prentices how he HAS heard say\\nthat a brook \"as clear as crystal\" once ran right down the middle of\\nHolborn, when Turnstile really was a turnstile, leading slap away\\ninto the meadows--gets such a flavour of the country out of this that\\nhe never wants to go there.\\n\\nThe day is closing in and the gas is lighted, but is not yet fully\\neffective, for it is not quite dark. Mr. Snagsby standing at his\\nshop-door looking up at the clouds sees a crow who is out late skim\\nwestward over the slice of sky belonging to Cook\\'s Court. The crow\\nflies straight across Chancery Lane and Lincoln\\'s Inn Garden into\\nLincoln\\'s Inn Fields.\\n\\nHere, in a large house, formerly a house of state, lives Mr.\\nTulkinghorn. It is let off in sets of chambers now, and in those\\nshrunken fragments of its greatness, lawyers lie like maggots in\\nnuts. But its roomy staircases, passages, and antechambers still\\nremain; and even its painted ceilings, where Allegory, in Roman\\nhelmet and celestial linen, sprawls among balustrades and pillars,\\nflowers, clouds, and big-legged boys, and makes the head ache--as\\nwould seem to be Allegory\\'s object always, more or less. Here, among\\nhis many boxes labelled with transcendent names, lives Mr.\\nTulkinghorn, when not speechlessly at home in country-houses where\\nthe great ones of the earth are bored to death. Here he is to-day,\\nquiet at his table. An oyster of the old school whom nobody can open.\\n\\nLike as he is to look at, so is his apartment in the dusk of\\nthe present afternoon. Rusty, out of date, withdrawing from\\nattention, able to afford it. Heavy, broad-backed, old-fashioned,\\nmahogany-and-horsehair chairs, not easily lifted; obsolete tables\\nwith spindle-legs and dusty baize covers; presentation prints of the\\nholders of great titles in the last generation or the last but one,\\nenviron him. A thick and dingy Turkey-carpet muffles the floor where\\nhe sits, attended by two candles in old-fashioned silver candlesticks\\nthat give a very insufficient light to his large room. The titles on\\nthe backs of his books have retired into the binding; everything that\\ncan have a lock has got one; no key is visible. Very few loose papers\\nare about. He has some manuscript near him, but is not referring\\nto it. With the round top of an inkstand and two broken bits of\\nsealing-wax he is silently and slowly working out whatever train of\\nindecision is in his mind. Now the inkstand top is in the middle, now\\nthe red bit of sealing-wax, now the black bit. That\\'s not it. Mr.\\nTulkinghorn must gather them all up and begin again.\\n\\nHere, beneath the painted ceiling, with foreshortened Allegory\\nstaring down at his intrusion as if it meant to swoop upon him, and\\nhe cutting it dead, Mr. Tulkinghorn has at once his house and office.\\nHe keeps no staff, only one middle-aged man, usually a little out at\\nelbows, who sits in a high pew in the hall and is rarely overburdened\\nwith business. Mr. Tulkinghorn is not in a common way. He wants no\\nclerks. He is a great reservoir of confidences, not to be so tapped.\\nHis clients want HIM; he is all in all. Drafts that he requires to be\\ndrawn are drawn by special-pleaders in the temple on mysterious\\ninstructions; fair copies that he requires to be made are made at the\\nstationers\\', expense being no consideration. The middle-aged man in\\nthe pew knows scarcely more of the affairs of the peerage than any\\ncrossing-sweeper in Holborn.\\n\\nThe red bit, the black bit, the inkstand top, the other inkstand top,\\nthe little sand-box. So! You to the middle, you to the right, you to\\nthe left. This train of indecision must surely be worked out now or\\nnever. Now! Mr. Tulkinghorn gets up, adjusts his spectacles, puts on\\nhis hat, puts the manuscript in his pocket, goes out, tells the\\nmiddle-aged man out at elbows, \"I shall be back presently.\" Very\\nrarely tells him anything more explicit.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn goes, as the crow came--not quite so straight, but\\nnearly--to Cook\\'s Court, Cursitor Street. To Snagsby\\'s,\\nLaw-Stationer\\'s, Deeds engrossed and copied, Law-Writing executed in\\nall its branches, &c., &c., &c.\\n\\nIt is somewhere about five or six o\\'clock in the afternoon, and a\\nbalmy fragrance of warm tea hovers in Cook\\'s Court. It hovers about\\nSnagsby\\'s door. The hours are early there: dinner at half-past one\\nand supper at half-past nine. Mr. Snagsby was about to descend into\\nthe subterranean regions to take tea when he looked out of his door\\njust now and saw the crow who was out late.\\n\\n\"Master at home?\"\\n\\nGuster is minding the shop, for the \\'prentices take tea in the\\nkitchen with Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby; consequently, the robe-maker\\'s two\\ndaughters, combing their curls at the two glasses in the two\\nsecond-floor windows of the opposite house, are not driving the two\\n\\'prentices to distraction as they fondly suppose, but are merely\\nawakening the unprofitable admiration of Guster, whose hair won\\'t\\ngrow, and never would, and it is confidently thought, never will.\\n\\n\"Master at home?\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\nMaster is at home, and Guster will fetch him. Guster disappears, glad\\nto get out of the shop, which she regards with mingled dread and\\nveneration as a storehouse of awful implements of the great torture\\nof the law--a place not to be entered after the gas is turned off.\\n\\nMr. Snagsby appears, greasy, warm, herbaceous, and chewing. Bolts a\\nbit of bread and butter. Says, \"Bless my soul, sir! Mr. Tulkinghorn!\"\\n\\n\"I want half a word with you, Snagsby.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, sir! Dear me, sir, why didn\\'t you send your young man\\nround for me? Pray walk into the back shop, sir.\" Snagsby has\\nbrightened in a moment.\\n\\nThe confined room, strong of parchment-grease, is warehouse,\\ncounting-house, and copying-office. Mr. Tulkinghorn sits, facing\\nround, on a stool at the desk.\\n\\n\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Snagsby.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\" Mr. Snagsby turns up the gas and coughs behind his hand,\\nmodestly anticipating profit. Mr. Snagsby, as a timid man, is\\naccustomed to cough with a variety of expressions, and so to save\\nwords.\\n\\n\"You copied some affidavits in that cause for me lately.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, we did.\"\\n\\n\"There was one of them,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, carelessly\\nfeeling--tight, unopenable oyster of the old school!--in the wrong\\ncoat-pocket, \"the handwriting of which is peculiar, and I rather\\nlike. As I happened to be passing, and thought I had it about me, I\\nlooked in to ask you--but I haven\\'t got it. No matter, any other time\\nwill do. Ah! here it is! I looked in to ask you who copied this.\"\\n\\n\"Who copied this, sir?\" says Mr. Snagsby, taking it, laying it flat\\non the desk, and separating all the sheets at once with a twirl and a\\ntwist of the left hand peculiar to lawstationers. \"We gave this out,\\nsir. We were giving out rather a large quantity of work just at that\\ntime. I can tell you in a moment who copied it, sir, by referring to\\nmy book.\"\\n\\nMr. Snagsby takes his book down from the safe, makes another bolt of\\nthe bit of bread and butter which seemed to have stopped short, eyes\\nthe affidavit aside, and brings his right forefinger travelling down\\na page of the book, \"Jewby--Packer--Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Jarndyce! Here we are, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby. \"To be sure! I might\\nhave remembered it. This was given out, sir, to a writer who lodges\\njust over on the opposite side of the lane.\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn has seen the entry, found it before the\\nlaw-stationer, read it while the forefinger was coming down the hill.\\n\\n\"WHAT do you call him? Nemo?\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"Nemo, sir. Here\\nit is. Forty-two folio. Given out on the Wednesday night at eight\\no\\'clock, brought in on the Thursday morning at half after nine.\"\\n\\n\"Nemo!\" repeats Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"Nemo is Latin for no one.\"\\n\\n\"It must be English for some one, sir, I think,\" Mr. Snagsby submits\\nwith his deferential cough. \"It is a person\\'s name. Here it is, you\\nsee, sir! Forty-two folio. Given out Wednesday night, eight o\\'clock;\\nbrought in Thursday morning, half after nine.\"\\n\\nThe tail of Mr. Snagsby\\'s eye becomes conscious of the head of Mrs.\\nSnagsby looking in at the shop-door to know what he means by\\ndeserting his tea. Mr. Snagsby addresses an explanatory cough to Mrs.\\nSnagsby, as who should say, \"My dear, a customer!\"\\n\\n\"Half after nine, sir,\" repeats Mr. Snagsby. \"Our law-writers, who\\nlive by job-work, are a queer lot; and this may not be his name, but\\nit\\'s the name he goes by. I remember now, sir, that he gives it in a\\nwritten advertisement he sticks up down at the Rule Office, and the\\nKing\\'s Bench Office, and the Judges\\' Chambers, and so forth. You know\\nthe kind of document, sir--wanting employ?\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn glances through the little window at the back of\\nCoavinses\\', the sheriff\\'s officer\\'s, where lights shine in Coavinses\\'\\nwindows. Coavinses\\' coffee-room is at the back, and the shadows of\\nseveral gentlemen under a cloud loom cloudily upon the blinds. Mr.\\nSnagsby takes the opportunity of slightly turning his head to glance\\nover his shoulder at his little woman and to make apologetic motions\\nwith his mouth to this effect: \"Tul-king-horn--rich--in-flu-en-tial!\"\\n\\n\"Have you given this man work before?\" asks Mr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, yes, sir! Work of yours.\"\\n\\n\"Thinking of more important matters, I forget where you said he\\nlived?\"\\n\\n\"Across the lane, sir. In fact, he lodges at a--\" Mr. Snagsby makes\\nanother bolt, as if the bit of bread and butter were insurmountable\\n\"--at a rag and bottle shop.\"\\n\\n\"Can you show me the place as I go back?\"\\n\\n\"With the greatest pleasure, sir!\"\\n\\nMr. Snagsby pulls off his sleeves and his grey coat, pulls on his\\nblack coat, takes his hat from its peg. \"Oh! Here is my little\\nwoman!\" he says aloud. \"My dear, will you be so kind as to tell one\\nof the lads to look after the shop while I step across the lane with\\nMr. Tulkinghorn? Mrs. Snagsby, sir--I shan\\'t be two minutes, my\\nlove!\"\\n\\nMrs. Snagsby bends to the lawyer, retires behind the counter, peeps\\nat them through the window-blind, goes softly into the back office,\\nrefers to the entries in the book still lying open. Is evidently\\ncurious.\\n\\n\"You will find that the place is rough, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby,\\nwalking deferentially in the road and leaving the narrow pavement to\\nthe lawyer; \"and the party is very rough. But they\\'re a wild lot in\\ngeneral, sir. The advantage of this particular man is that he never\\nwants sleep. He\\'ll go at it right on end if you want him to, as long\\nas ever you like.\"\\n\\nIt is quite dark now, and the gas-lamps have acquired their full\\neffect. Jostling against clerks going to post the day\\'s letters, and\\nagainst counsel and attorneys going home to dinner, and against\\nplaintiffs and defendants and suitors of all sorts, and against the\\ngeneral crowd, in whose way the forensic wisdom of ages has\\ninterposed a million of obstacles to the transaction of the commonest\\nbusiness of life; diving through law and equity, and through that\\nkindred mystery, the street mud, which is made of nobody knows what\\nand collects about us nobody knows whence or how--we only knowing in\\ngeneral that when there is too much of it we find it necessary to\\nshovel it away--the lawyer and the law-stationer come to a rag and\\nbottle shop and general emporium of much disregarded merchandise,\\nlying and being in the shadow of the wall of Lincoln\\'s Inn, and kept,\\nas is announced in paint, to all whom it may concern, by one Krook.\\n\\n\"This is where he lives, sir,\" says the law-stationer.\\n\\n\"This is where he lives, is it?\" says the lawyer unconcernedly.\\n\"Thank you.\"\\n\\n\"Are you not going in, sir?\"\\n\\n\"No, thank you, no; I am going on to the Fields at present. Good\\nevening. Thank you!\" Mr. Snagsby lifts his hat and returns to his\\nlittle woman and his tea.\\n\\nBut Mr. Tulkinghorn does not go on to the Fields at present. He goes\\na short way, turns back, comes again to the shop of Mr. Krook, and\\nenters it straight. It is dim enough, with a blot-headed candle or so\\nin the windows, and an old man and a cat sitting in the back part by\\na fire. The old man rises and comes forward, with another blot-headed\\ncandle in his hand.\\n\\n\"Pray is your lodger within?\"\\n\\n\"Male or female, sir?\" says Mr. Krook.\\n\\n\"Male. The person who does copying.\"\\n\\nMr. Krook has eyed his man narrowly. Knows him by sight. Has an\\nindistinct impression of his aristocratic repute.\\n\\n\"Did you wish to see him, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s what I seldom do myself,\" says Mr. Krook with a grin. \"Shall I\\ncall him down? But it\\'s a weak chance if he\\'d come, sir!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go up to him, then,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"Second floor, sir. Take the candle. Up there!\" Mr. Krook, with his\\ncat beside him, stands at the bottom of the staircase, looking after\\nMr. Tulkinghorn. \"Hi-hi!\" he says when Mr. Tulkinghorn has nearly\\ndisappeared. The lawyer looks down over the hand-rail. The cat\\nexpands her wicked mouth and snarls at him.\\n\\n\"Order, Lady Jane! Behave yourself to visitors, my lady! You know\\nwhat they say of my lodger?\" whispers Krook, going up a step or two.\\n\\n\"What do they say of him?\"\\n\\n\"They say he has sold himself to the enemy, but you and I know\\nbetter--he don\\'t buy. I\\'ll tell you what, though; my lodger is so\\nblack-humoured and gloomy that I believe he\\'d as soon make that\\nbargain as any other. Don\\'t put him out, sir. That\\'s my advice!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn with a nod goes on his way. He comes to the dark door\\non the second floor. He knocks, receives no answer, opens it, and\\naccidentally extinguishes his candle in doing so.\\n\\nThe air of the room is almost bad enough to have extinguished it if\\nhe had not. It is a small room, nearly black with soot, and grease,\\nand dirt. In the rusty skeleton of a grate, pinched at the middle as\\nif poverty had gripped it, a red coke fire burns low. In the corner\\nby the chimney stand a deal table and a broken desk, a wilderness\\nmarked with a rain of ink. In another corner a ragged old portmanteau\\non one of the two chairs serves for cabinet or wardrobe; no larger\\none is needed, for it collapses like the cheeks of a starved man. The\\nfloor is bare, except that one old mat, trodden to shreds of\\nrope-yarn, lies perishing upon the hearth. No curtain veils the\\ndarkness of the night, but the discoloured shutters are drawn\\ntogether, and through the two gaunt holes pierced in them, famine\\nmight be staring in--the banshee of the man upon the bed.\\n\\nFor, on a low bed opposite the fire, a confusion of dirty patchwork,\\nlean-ribbed ticking, and coarse sacking, the lawyer, hesitating just\\nwithin the doorway, sees a man. He lies there, dressed in shirt and\\ntrousers, with bare feet. He has a yellow look in the spectral\\ndarkness of a candle that has guttered down until the whole length of\\nits wick (still burning) has doubled over and left a tower of\\nwinding-sheet above it. His hair is ragged, mingling with his\\nwhiskers and his beard--the latter, ragged too, and grown, like the\\nscum and mist around him, in neglect. Foul and filthy as the room is,\\nfoul and filthy as the air is, it is not easy to perceive what fumes\\nthose are which most oppress the senses in it; but through the\\ngeneral sickliness and faintness, and the odour of stale tobacco,\\nthere comes into the lawyer\\'s mouth the bitter, vapid taste of opium.\\n\\n\"Hallo, my friend!\" he cries, and strikes his iron candlestick\\nagainst the door.\\n\\nHe thinks he has awakened his friend. He lies a little turned away,\\nbut his eyes are surely open.\\n\\n\"Hallo, my friend!\" he cries again. \"Hallo! Hallo!\"\\n\\nAs he rattles on the door, the candle which has drooped so long goes\\nout and leaves him in the dark, with the gaunt eyes in the shutters\\nstaring down upon the bed.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'model_output': \"\\n\\nJohn was worried about his friend James, who had been acting distant lately. He decided to check on James one night and found his apartment dark and unwelcoming. When James didn't respond to his knocking, John looked through the keyhole and saw James' silhouette lying still on the bed. As John called out in vain to wake his friend, a cold draft blew out his candle, leaving him in darkness. Looking up, John saw a pair of gaunt, staring eyes gazing at him through the blackness. \\n\\nUneasy about James' unresponsiveness and the ominous scene, John vowed to get to the bottom of the mystery surrounding his friend's strange behavior.

Esther encountered an array of characters involved in a convoluted legal dispute over an inheritance that shed light on social injustices. While human relationships provided hope, the bleak setting and stagnant affairs portrayed a dreary backdrop. Together, the vignettes explore themes of isolation, mystery, and perseverance through adversity.\"}, {'summary': 'The scene opens in London on a foggy, smoggy day. The High Court of Chancery is in session, and it appears that the fog has settled thickest on this part of London. This is where the legal suit of Jarndyce and Jarndyce is being argued. A little mad old woman (Miss Flite), and a man from Shropshire (Mr. Gridley) are in attendance. A \"sallow prisoner\" is brought forward. Mr. Tangle, a lawyer, speaks with the Lord High Chancellor, and the matter of the two young wards in Jarndyce is discussed. This matter will come up before the court tomorrow.\\n\\nThe scene changes in Chapter 2 to Chesney Wold, a stately home in Lincolnshire. Here the weather is also bad, but it is constant rain rather than fog. The lady of the manor, Lady Dedlock, is bored to death. She had been in London, and has come back to the country seat before leaving for Paris in a few days.\\n\\nLady Dedlock is introduced to us as a very beautiful middle-aged society lady, her charms undimmed by time. She is exceedingly dignified and self-controlled, but her \"caprices,\" which she tries to hide, are known to her servants and tradesmen. She is the wife of Sir Leicester Dedlock, a baronet, who has married somehat beneath him. It is clear that Lady Dedlock has brought neither an aristocratic lineage or a fortune to the marriage. It is also clear that Sir Leicester has such a great amount of both of those things, and loves her so dearly, that it matters not to him.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn, the family solicitor, has come down to Chesney Wold to discuss the Jarndyce case, in which Lady Dedlock has some slight interest. He is a secretive, enigmatic man, of the most controlled and logical character. He brings many legal papers with him, and Lady Dedlock seems to take an interest in the handwriting on one of them. She asks whose writing it is, but Mr. Tulkinghorn cannot answer her. She becomes faint and must be taken to her room.\\n\\nIn Chapter 3, Esther Summerson\\'s life story is told. She has been materially provided for but emotionally neglected by her \"godmother\" in the town of Windsor. When Esther is about fourteen, her godmother dies, and Esther is sent to Greenleaf school. Through Mr. Kenge, John Jarndyce\\'s solicitor, who comes to see Esther after her godmother\\'s death, she learns her benefactor is Mr. Jarndyce. She has never seen him, but he appears, unbeknownst to her until years later, in the carriage that takes her to Greenleaf school. She is sent there after her godmother\\'s death, and passes six happy years there, being taught by the Misses Donny. Her accounts are paid by her unknown benefactor all the while. When she is older she becomes a teacher of the other girls there, and inspires great affection in her students.\\n\\nWhen she has grown old and educated enough to leave Greenleaf school, she is asked to serve in her benefactor\\'s house, Bleak House. She is brought to Chancery Court to meet Ada Clare and Richard Carstone, two wards in the Jarndyce suit, who are also under the guardianship of Mr. Jarndyce. Esther is meant to be Ada\\'s lady companion.\\n\\nAs they leave the court, they meet Miss Flite, who introduces herself. They learn she is also a suitor in Chancery, and observe that she is poor, eccentric, and perhaps a little mad.\\n\\nIn Chapter 4, the three young people are sent to stay the night at the Jellyby household. Mrs. Jellyby is a philanthropic lady who neglects her large and chaotic household in favor of writing long letters, dictated to her eldest daughter Caddy, about the social conditions in places in Africa. Caddy, an overworked waif, clings to Esther and becomes her friend, as does the youngest neglected child, Peepy. ', 'text': 'London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting\\nin Lincoln\\'s Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in\\nthe streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of\\nthe earth, and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus,\\nforty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn\\nHill. Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black\\ndrizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown\\nsnowflakes--gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of\\nthe sun. Dogs, undistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better;\\nsplashed to their very blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one\\nanother\\'s umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper, and losing\\ntheir foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of thousands of other\\nfoot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke\\n(if this day ever broke), adding new deposits to the crust upon crust\\nof mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and\\naccumulating at compound interest.\\n\\nFog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and\\nmeadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers\\nof shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city.\\nFog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping\\ninto the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards and\\nhovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales\\nof barges and small boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient\\nGreenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog\\nin the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper,\\ndown in his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of\\nhis shivering little \\'prentice boy on deck. Chance people on the\\nbridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog\\nall round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the\\nmisty clouds.\\n\\nGas looming through the fog in divers places in the streets, much as\\nthe sun may, from the spongey fields, be seen to loom by husbandman\\nand ploughboy. Most of the shops lighted two hours before their\\ntime--as the gas seems to know, for it has a haggard and unwilling\\nlook.\\n\\nThe raw afternoon is rawest, and the dense fog is densest, and the\\nmuddy streets are muddiest near that leaden-headed old obstruction,\\nappropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed old\\ncorporation, Temple Bar. And hard by Temple Bar, in Lincoln\\'s Inn\\nHall, at the very heart of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor in\\nhis High Court of Chancery.\\n\\nNever can there come fog too thick, never can there come mud and mire\\ntoo deep, to assort with the groping and floundering condition which\\nthis High Court of Chancery, most pestilent of hoary sinners, holds\\nthis day in the sight of heaven and earth.\\n\\nOn such an afternoon, if ever, the Lord High Chancellor ought to be\\nsitting here--as here he is--with a foggy glory round his head,\\nsoftly fenced in with crimson cloth and curtains, addressed by a\\nlarge advocate with great whiskers, a little voice, and an\\ninterminable brief, and outwardly directing his contemplation to the\\nlantern in the roof, where he can see nothing but fog. On such an\\nafternoon some score of members of the High Court of Chancery bar\\nought to be--as here they are--mistily engaged in one of the ten\\nthousand stages of an endless cause, tripping one another up on\\nslippery precedents, groping knee-deep in technicalities, running\\ntheir goat-hair and horsehair warded heads against walls of words and\\nmaking a pretence of equity with serious faces, as players might. On\\nsuch an afternoon the various solicitors in the cause, some two or\\nthree of whom have inherited it from their fathers, who made a\\nfortune by it, ought to be--as are they not?--ranged in a line, in a\\nlong matted well (but you might look in vain for truth at the bottom\\nof it) between the registrar\\'s red table and the silk gowns, with\\nbills, cross-bills, answers, rejoinders, injunctions, affidavits,\\nissues, references to masters, masters\\' reports, mountains of costly\\nnonsense, piled before them. Well may the court be dim, with wasting\\ncandles here and there; well may the fog hang heavy in it, as if it\\nwould never get out; well may the stained-glass windows lose their\\ncolour and admit no light of day into the place; well may the\\nuninitiated from the streets, who peep in through the glass panes in\\nthe door, be deterred from entrance by its owlish aspect and by the\\ndrawl, languidly echoing to the roof from the padded dais where the\\nLord High Chancellor looks into the lantern that has no light in it\\nand where the attendant wigs are all stuck in a fog-bank! This is the\\nCourt of Chancery, which has its decaying houses and its blighted\\nlands in every shire, which has its worn-out lunatic in every\\nmadhouse and its dead in every churchyard, which has its ruined\\nsuitor with his slipshod heels and threadbare dress borrowing and\\nbegging through the round of every man\\'s acquaintance, which gives to\\nmonied might the means abundantly of wearying out the right, which so\\nexhausts finances, patience, courage, hope, so overthrows the brain\\nand breaks the heart, that there is not an honourable man among its\\npractitioners who would not give--who does not often give--the\\nwarning, \"Suffer any wrong that can be done you rather than come\\nhere!\"\\n\\nWho happen to be in the Lord Chancellor\\'s court this murky afternoon\\nbesides the Lord Chancellor, the counsel in the cause, two or three\\ncounsel who are never in any cause, and the well of solicitors before\\nmentioned? There is the registrar below the judge, in wig and gown;\\nand there are two or three maces, or petty-bags, or privy purses, or\\nwhatever they may be, in legal court suits. These are all yawning,\\nfor no crumb of amusement ever falls from Jarndyce and Jarndyce (the\\ncause in hand), which was squeezed dry years upon years ago. The\\nshort-hand writers, the reporters of the court, and the reporters of\\nthe newspapers invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce comes on. Their places are a blank. Standing on\\na seat at the side of the hall, the better to peer into the curtained\\nsanctuary, is a little mad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is\\nalways in court, from its sitting to its rising, and always expecting\\nsome incomprehensible judgment to be given in her favour. Some say\\nshe really is, or was, a party to a suit, but no one knows for\\ncertain because no one cares. She carries some small litter in a\\nreticule which she calls her documents, principally consisting of\\npaper matches and dry lavender. A sallow prisoner has come up, in\\ncustody, for the half-dozenth time to make a personal application \"to\\npurge himself of his contempt,\" which, being a solitary surviving\\nexecutor who has fallen into a state of conglomeration about accounts\\nof which it is not pretended that he had ever any knowledge, he is\\nnot at all likely ever to do. In the meantime his prospects in life\\nare ended. Another ruined suitor, who periodically appears from\\nShropshire and breaks out into efforts to address the Chancellor at\\nthe close of the day\\'s business and who can by no means be made to\\nunderstand that the Chancellor is legally ignorant of his existence\\nafter making it desolate for a quarter of a century, plants himself\\nin a good place and keeps an eye on the judge, ready to call out \"My\\nLord!\" in a voice of sonorous complaint on the instant of his rising.\\nA few lawyers\\' clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger\\non the chance of his furnishing some fun and enlivening the dismal\\nweather a little.\\n\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in\\ncourse of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it\\nmeans. The parties to it understand it least, but it has been\\nobserved that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five\\nminutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the\\npremises. Innumerable children have been born into the cause;\\ninnumerable young people have married into it; innumerable old people\\nhave died out of it. Scores of persons have deliriously found\\nthemselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without knowing how\\nor why; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the\\nsuit. The little plaintiff or defendant who was promised a new\\nrocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled has grown\\nup, possessed himself of a real horse, and trotted away into the\\nother world. Fair wards of court have faded into mothers and\\ngrandmothers; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone\\nout; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere\\nbills of mortality; there are not three Jarndyces left upon the earth\\nperhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a\\ncoffee-house in Chancery Lane; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags\\nits dreary length before the court, perennially hopeless.\\n\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce has passed into a joke. That is the only good\\nthat has ever come of it. It has been death to many, but it is a joke\\nin the profession. Every master in Chancery has had a reference out\\nof it. Every Chancellor was \"in it,\" for somebody or other, when he\\nwas counsel at the bar. Good things have been said about it by\\nblue-nosed, bulbous-shoed old benchers in select port-wine committee\\nafter dinner in hall. Articled clerks have been in the habit of\\nfleshing their legal wit upon it. The last Lord Chancellor handled it\\nneatly, when, correcting Mr. Blowers, the eminent silk gown who said\\nthat such a thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes, he\\nobserved, \"or when we get through Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mr.\\nBlowers\"--a pleasantry that particularly tickled the maces, bags, and\\npurses.\\n\\nHow many people out of the suit Jarndyce and Jarndyce has stretched\\nforth its unwholesome hand to spoil and corrupt would be a very wide\\nquestion. From the master upon whose impaling files reams of dusty\\nwarrants in Jarndyce and Jarndyce have grimly writhed into many\\nshapes, down to the copying-clerk in the Six Clerks\\' Office who has\\ncopied his tens of thousands of Chancery folio-pages under that\\neternal heading, no man\\'s nature has been made better by it. In\\ntrickery, evasion, procrastination, spoliation, botheration, under\\nfalse pretences of all sorts, there are influences that can never\\ncome to good. The very solicitors\\' boys who have kept the wretched\\nsuitors at bay, by protesting time out of mind that Mr. Chizzle,\\nMizzle, or otherwise was particularly engaged and had appointments\\nuntil dinner, may have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into\\nthemselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The receiver in the cause\\nhas acquired a goodly sum of money by it but has acquired too a\\ndistrust of his own mother and a contempt for his own kind. Chizzle,\\nMizzle, and otherwise have lapsed into a habit of vaguely promising\\nthemselves that they will look into that outstanding little matter\\nand see what can be done for Drizzle--who was not well used--when\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of the office. Shirking and\\nsharking in all their many varieties have been sown broadcast by the\\nill-fated cause; and even those who have contemplated its history\\nfrom the outermost circle of such evil have been insensibly tempted\\ninto a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad\\ncourse, and a loose belief that if the world go wrong it was in some\\noff-hand manner never meant to go right.\\n\\nThus, in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog, sits the\\nLord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery.\\n\\n\"Mr. Tangle,\" says the Lord High Chancellor, latterly something\\nrestless under the eloquence of that learned gentleman.\\n\\n\"Mlud,\" says Mr. Tangle. Mr. Tangle knows more of Jarndyce and\\nJarndyce than anybody. He is famous for it--supposed never to have\\nread anything else since he left school.\\n\\n\"Have you nearly concluded your argument?\"\\n\\n\"Mlud, no--variety of points--feel it my duty tsubmit--ludship,\" is\\nthe reply that slides out of Mr. Tangle.\\n\\n\"Several members of the bar are still to be heard, I believe?\" says\\nthe Chancellor with a slight smile.\\n\\nEighteen of Mr. Tangle\\'s learned friends, each armed with a little\\nsummary of eighteen hundred sheets, bob up like eighteen hammers in a\\npianoforte, make eighteen bows, and drop into their eighteen places\\nof obscurity.\\n\\n\"We will proceed with the hearing on Wednesday fortnight,\" says the\\nChancellor. For the question at issue is only a question of costs, a\\nmere bud on the forest tree of the parent suit, and really will come\\nto a settlement one of these days.\\n\\nThe Chancellor rises; the bar rises; the prisoner is brought forward\\nin a hurry; the man from Shropshire cries, \"My lord!\" Maces, bags,\\nand purses indignantly proclaim silence and frown at the man from\\nShropshire.\\n\\n\"In reference,\" proceeds the Chancellor, still on Jarndyce and\\nJarndyce, \"to the young girl--\"\\n\\n\"Begludship\\'s pardon--boy,\" says Mr. Tangle prematurely. \"In\\nreference,\" proceeds the Chancellor with extra distinctness, \"to the\\nyoung girl and boy, the two young people\"--Mr. Tangle crushed--\"whom\\nI directed to be in attendance to-day and who are now in my private\\nroom, I will see them and satisfy myself as to the expediency of\\nmaking the order for their residing with their uncle.\"\\n\\nMr. Tangle on his legs again. \"Begludship\\'s pardon--dead.\"\\n\\n\"With their\"--Chancellor looking through his double eye-glass at the\\npapers on his desk--\"grandfather.\"\\n\\n\"Begludship\\'s pardon--victim of rash action--brains.\"\\n\\nSuddenly a very little counsel with a terrific bass voice arises,\\nfully inflated, in the back settlements of the fog, and says, \"Will\\nyour lordship allow me? I appear for him. He is a cousin, several\\ntimes removed. I am not at the moment prepared to inform the court in\\nwhat exact remove he is a cousin, but he IS a cousin.\"\\n\\nLeaving this address (delivered like a sepulchral message) ringing in\\nthe rafters of the roof, the very little counsel drops, and the fog\\nknows him no more. Everybody looks for him. Nobody can see him.\\n\\n\"I will speak with both the young people,\" says the Chancellor anew,\\n\"and satisfy myself on the subject of their residing with their\\ncousin. I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I take my\\nseat.\"\\n\\nThe Chancellor is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is\\npresented. Nothing can possibly come of the prisoner\\'s conglomeration\\nbut his being sent back to prison, which is soon done. The man from\\nShropshire ventures another remonstrative \"My lord!\" but the\\nChancellor, being aware of him, has dexterously vanished. Everybody\\nelse quickly vanishes too. A battery of blue bags is loaded with\\nheavy charges of papers and carried off by clerks; the little mad old\\nwoman marches off with her documents; the empty court is locked up.\\nIf all the injustice it has committed and all the misery it has\\ncaused could only be locked up with it, and the whole burnt away in a\\ngreat funeral pyre--why so much the better for other parties than the\\nparties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce!\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this same\\nmiry afternoon. It is not so unlike the Court of Chancery but that we\\nmay pass from the one scene to the other, as the crow flies. Both the\\nworld of fashion and the Court of Chancery are things of precedent\\nand usage: oversleeping Rip Van Winkles who have played at strange\\ngames through a deal of thundery weather; sleeping beauties whom the\\nknight will wake one day, when all the stopped spits in the kitchen\\nshall begin to turn prodigiously!\\n\\nIt is not a large world. Relatively even to this world of ours, which\\nhas its limits too (as your Highness shall find when you have made\\nthe tour of it and are come to the brink of the void beyond), it is a\\nvery little speck. There is much good in it; there are many good and\\ntrue people in it; it has its appointed place. But the evil of it is\\nthat it is a world wrapped up in too much jeweller\\'s cotton and fine\\nwool, and cannot hear the rushing of the larger worlds, and cannot\\nsee them as they circle round the sun. It is a deadened world, and\\nits growth is sometimes unhealthy for want of air.\\n\\nMy Lady Dedlock has returned to her house in town for a few days\\nprevious to her departure for Paris, where her ladyship intends to\\nstay some weeks, after which her movements are uncertain. The\\nfashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the Parisians,\\nand it knows all fashionable things. To know things otherwise were to\\nbe unfashionable. My Lady Dedlock has been down at what she calls, in\\nfamiliar conversation, her \"place\" in Lincolnshire. The waters are\\nout in Lincolnshire. An arch of the bridge in the park has been\\nsapped and sopped away. The adjacent low-lying ground for half a mile\\nin breadth is a stagnant river with melancholy trees for islands in\\nit and a surface punctured all over, all day long, with falling rain.\\nMy Lady Dedlock\\'s place has been extremely dreary. The weather for\\nmany a day and night has been so wet that the trees seem wet through,\\nand the soft loppings and prunings of the woodman\\'s axe can make no\\ncrash or crackle as they fall. The deer, looking soaked, leave\\nquagmires where they pass. The shot of a rifle loses its sharpness in\\nthe moist air, and its smoke moves in a tardy little cloud towards\\nthe green rise, coppice-topped, that makes a background for the\\nfalling rain. The view from my Lady Dedlock\\'s own windows is\\nalternately a lead-coloured view and a view in Indian ink. The vases\\non the stone terrace in the foreground catch the rain all day; and\\nthe heavy drops fall--drip, drip, drip--upon the broad flagged\\npavement, called from old time the Ghost\\'s Walk, all night. On\\nSundays the little church in the park is mouldy; the oaken pulpit\\nbreaks out into a cold sweat; and there is a general smell and taste\\nas of the ancient Dedlocks in their graves. My Lady Dedlock (who is\\nchildless), looking out in the early twilight from her boudoir at a\\nkeeper\\'s lodge and seeing the light of a fire upon the latticed\\npanes, and smoke rising from the chimney, and a child, chased by a\\nwoman, running out into the rain to meet the shining figure of a\\nwrapped-up man coming through the gate, has been put quite out of\\ntemper. My Lady Dedlock says she has been \"bored to death.\"\\n\\nTherefore my Lady Dedlock has come away from the place in\\nLincolnshire and has left it to the rain, and the crows, and the\\nrabbits, and the deer, and the partridges and pheasants. The pictures\\nof the Dedlocks past and gone have seemed to vanish into the damp\\nwalls in mere lowness of spirits, as the housekeeper has passed along\\nthe old rooms shutting up the shutters. And when they will next come\\nforth again, the fashionable intelligence--which, like the fiend, is\\nomniscient of the past and present, but not the future--cannot yet\\nundertake to say.\\n\\nSir Leicester Dedlock is only a baronet, but there is no mightier\\nbaronet than he. His family is as old as the hills, and infinitely\\nmore respectable. He has a general opinion that the world might get\\non without hills but would be done up without Dedlocks. He would on\\nthe whole admit nature to be a good idea (a little low, perhaps, when\\nnot enclosed with a park-fence), but an idea dependent for its\\nexecution on your great county families. He is a gentleman of strict\\nconscience, disdainful of all littleness and meanness and ready on\\nthe shortest notice to die any death you may please to mention rather\\nthan give occasion for the least impeachment of his integrity. He is\\nan honourable, obstinate, truthful, high-spirited, intensely\\nprejudiced, perfectly unreasonable man.\\n\\nSir Leicester is twenty years, full measure, older than my Lady. He\\nwill never see sixty-five again, nor perhaps sixty-six, nor yet\\nsixty-seven. He has a twist of the gout now and then and walks a\\nlittle stiffly. He is of a worthy presence, with his light-grey hair\\nand whiskers, his fine shirt-frill, his pure-white waistcoat, and his\\nblue coat with bright buttons always buttoned. He is ceremonious,\\nstately, most polite on every occasion to my Lady, and holds her\\npersonal attractions in the highest estimation. His gallantry to my\\nLady, which has never changed since he courted her, is the one little\\ntouch of romantic fancy in him.\\n\\nIndeed, he married her for love. A whisper still goes about that she\\nhad not even family; howbeit, Sir Leicester had so much family that\\nperhaps he had enough and could dispense with any more. But she had\\nbeauty, pride, ambition, insolent resolve, and sense enough to\\nportion out a legion of fine ladies. Wealth and station, added to\\nthese, soon floated her upward, and for years now my Lady Dedlock has\\nbeen at the centre of the fashionable intelligence and at the top of\\nthe fashionable tree.\\n\\nHow Alexander wept when he had no more worlds to conquer, everybody\\nknows--or has some reason to know by this time, the matter having\\nbeen rather frequently mentioned. My Lady Dedlock, having conquered\\nHER world, fell not into the melting, but rather into the freezing,\\nmood. An exhausted composure, a worn-out placidity, an equanimity of\\nfatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction, are the\\ntrophies of her victory. She is perfectly well-bred. If she could be\\ntranslated to heaven to-morrow, she might be expected to ascend\\nwithout any rapture.\\n\\nShe has beauty still, and if it be not in its heyday, it is not yet\\nin its autumn. She has a fine face--originally of a character that\\nwould be rather called very pretty than handsome, but improved into\\nclassicality by the acquired expression of her fashionable state. Her\\nfigure is elegant and has the effect of being tall. Not that she is\\nso, but that \"the most is made,\" as the Honourable Bob Stables has\\nfrequently asserted upon oath, \"of all her points.\" The same\\nauthority observes that she is perfectly got up and remarks in\\ncommendation of her hair especially that she is the best-groomed\\nwoman in the whole stud.\\n\\nWith all her perfections on her head, my Lady Dedlock has come up\\nfrom her place in Lincolnshire (hotly pursued by the fashionable\\nintelligence) to pass a few days at her house in town previous to her\\ndeparture for Paris, where her ladyship intends to stay some weeks,\\nafter which her movements are uncertain. And at her house in town,\\nupon this muddy, murky afternoon, presents himself an old-fashioned\\nold gentleman, attorney-at-law and eke solicitor of the High Court of\\nChancery, who has the honour of acting as legal adviser of the\\nDedlocks and has as many cast-iron boxes in his office with that name\\noutside as if the present baronet were the coin of the conjuror\\'s\\ntrick and were constantly being juggled through the whole set. Across\\nthe hall, and up the stairs, and along the passages, and through the\\nrooms, which are very brilliant in the season and very dismal out of\\nit--fairy-land to visit, but a desert to live in--the old gentleman\\nis conducted by a Mercury in powder to my Lady\\'s presence.\\n\\nThe old gentleman is rusty to look at, but is reputed to have made\\ngood thrift out of aristocratic marriage settlements and aristocratic\\nwills, and to be very rich. He is surrounded by a mysterious halo of\\nfamily confidences, of which he is known to be the silent depository.\\nThere are noble mausoleums rooted for centuries in retired glades of\\nparks among the growing timber and the fern, which perhaps hold fewer\\nnoble secrets than walk abroad among men, shut up in the breast of\\nMr. Tulkinghorn. He is of what is called the old school--a phrase\\ngenerally meaning any school that seems never to have been young--and\\nwears knee-breeches tied with ribbons, and gaiters or stockings. One\\npeculiarity of his black clothes and of his black stockings, be they\\nsilk or worsted, is that they never shine. Mute, close, irresponsive\\nto any glancing light, his dress is like himself. He never converses\\nwhen not professionally consulted. He is found sometimes, speechless\\nbut quite at home, at corners of dinner-tables in great country\\nhouses and near doors of drawing-rooms, concerning which the\\nfashionable intelligence is eloquent, where everybody knows him and\\nwhere half the Peerage stops to say \"How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?\"\\nHe receives these salutations with gravity and buries them along with\\nthe rest of his knowledge.\\n\\nSir Leicester Dedlock is with my Lady and is happy to see Mr.\\nTulkinghorn. There is an air of prescription about him which is\\nalways agreeable to Sir Leicester; he receives it as a kind of\\ntribute. He likes Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s dress; there is a kind of tribute\\nin that too. It is eminently respectable, and likewise, in a general\\nway, retainer-like. It expresses, as it were, the steward of the\\nlegal mysteries, the butler of the legal cellar, of the Dedlocks.\\n\\nHas Mr. Tulkinghorn any idea of this himself? It may be so, or it may\\nnot, but there is this remarkable circumstance to be noted in\\neverything associated with my Lady Dedlock as one of a class--as one\\nof the leaders and representatives of her little world. She supposes\\nherself to be an inscrutable Being, quite out of the reach and ken of\\nordinary mortals--seeing herself in her glass, where indeed she looks\\nso. Yet every dim little star revolving about her, from her maid to\\nthe manager of the Italian Opera, knows her weaknesses, prejudices,\\nfollies, haughtinesses, and caprices and lives upon as accurate a\\ncalculation and as nice a measure of her moral nature as her\\ndressmaker takes of her physical proportions. Is a new dress, a new\\ncustom, a new singer, a new dancer, a new form of jewellery, a new\\ndwarf or giant, a new chapel, a new anything, to be set up? There are\\ndeferential people in a dozen callings whom my Lady Dedlock suspects\\nof nothing but prostration before her, who can tell you how to manage\\nher as if she were a baby, who do nothing but nurse her all their\\nlives, who, humbly affecting to follow with profound subservience,\\nlead her and her whole troop after them; who, in hooking one, hook\\nall and bear them off as Lemuel Gulliver bore away the stately fleet\\nof the majestic Lilliput. \"If you want to address our people, sir,\"\\nsay Blaze and Sparkle, the jewellers--meaning by our people Lady\\nDedlock and the rest--\"you must remember that you are not dealing\\nwith the general public; you must hit our people in their weakest\\nplace, and their weakest place is such a place.\" \"To make this\\narticle go down, gentlemen,\" say Sheen and Gloss, the mercers, to\\ntheir friends the manufacturers, \"you must come to us, because we\\nknow where to have the fashionable people, and we can make it\\nfashionable.\" \"If you want to get this print upon the tables of my\\nhigh connexion, sir,\" says Mr. Sladdery, the librarian, \"or if you\\nwant to get this dwarf or giant into the houses of my high connexion,\\nsir, or if you want to secure to this entertainment the patronage of\\nmy high connexion, sir, you must leave it, if you please, to me, for\\nI have been accustomed to study the leaders of my high connexion,\\nsir, and I may tell you without vanity that I can turn them round my\\nfinger\"--in which Mr. Sladdery, who is an honest man, does not\\nexaggerate at all.\\n\\nTherefore, while Mr. Tulkinghorn may not know what is passing in the\\nDedlock mind at present, it is very possible that he may.\\n\\n\"My Lady\\'s cause has been again before the Chancellor, has it, Mr.\\nTulkinghorn?\" says Sir Leicester, giving him his hand.\\n\\n\"Yes. It has been on again to-day,\" Mr. Tulkinghorn replies, making\\none of his quiet bows to my Lady, who is on a sofa near the fire,\\nshading her face with a hand-screen.\\n\\n\"It would be useless to ask,\" says my Lady with the dreariness of the\\nplace in Lincolnshire still upon her, \"whether anything has been\\ndone.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing that YOU would call anything has been done to-day,\" replies\\nMr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"Nor ever will be,\" says my Lady.\\n\\nSir Leicester has no objection to an interminable Chancery suit. It\\nis a slow, expensive, British, constitutional kind of thing. To be\\nsure, he has not a vital interest in the suit in question, her part\\nin which was the only property my Lady brought him; and he has a\\nshadowy impression that for his name--the name of Dedlock--to be in a\\ncause, and not in the title of that cause, is a most ridiculous\\naccident. But he regards the Court of Chancery, even if it should\\ninvolve an occasional delay of justice and a trifling amount of\\nconfusion, as a something devised in conjunction with a variety of\\nother somethings by the perfection of human wisdom for the eternal\\nsettlement (humanly speaking) of everything. And he is upon the whole\\nof a fixed opinion that to give the sanction of his countenance to\\nany complaints respecting it would be to encourage some person in the\\nlower classes to rise up somewhere--like Wat Tyler.\\n\\n\"As a few fresh affidavits have been put upon the file,\" says Mr.\\nTulkinghorn, \"and as they are short, and as I proceed upon the\\ntroublesome principle of begging leave to possess my clients with any\\nnew proceedings in a cause\"--cautious man Mr. Tulkinghorn, taking no\\nmore responsibility than necessary--\"and further, as I see you are\\ngoing to Paris, I have brought them in my pocket.\"\\n\\n(Sir Leicester was going to Paris too, by the by, but the delight of\\nthe fashionable intelligence was in his Lady.)\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn takes out his papers, asks permission to place them\\non a golden talisman of a table at my Lady\\'s elbow, puts on his\\nspectacles, and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp.\\n\\n\"\\'In Chancery. Between John Jarndyce--\\'\"\\n\\nMy Lady interrupts, requesting him to miss as many of the formal\\nhorrors as he can.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn glances over his spectacles and begins again lower\\ndown. My Lady carelessly and scornfully abstracts her attention. Sir\\nLeicester in a great chair looks at the file and appears to have a\\nstately liking for the legal repetitions and prolixities as ranging\\namong the national bulwarks. It happens that the fire is hot where my\\nLady sits and that the hand-screen is more beautiful than useful,\\nbeing priceless but small. My Lady, changing her position, sees the\\npapers on the table--looks at them nearer--looks at them nearer\\nstill--asks impulsively, \"Who copied that?\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn stops short, surprised by my Lady\\'s animation and her\\nunusual tone.\\n\\n\"Is it what you people call law-hand?\" she asks, looking full at him\\nin her careless way again and toying with her screen.\\n\\n\"Not quite. Probably\"--Mr. Tulkinghorn examines it as he speaks--\"the\\nlegal character which it has was acquired after the original hand was\\nformed. Why do you ask?\"\\n\\n\"Anything to vary this detestable monotony. Oh, go on, do!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn reads again. The heat is greater; my Lady screens her\\nface. Sir Leicester dozes, starts up suddenly, and cries, \"Eh? What\\ndo you say?\"\\n\\n\"I say I am afraid,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, who had risen hastily,\\n\"that Lady Dedlock is ill.\"\\n\\n\"Faint,\" my Lady murmurs with white lips, \"only that; but it is like\\nthe faintness of death. Don\\'t speak to me. Ring, and take me to my\\nroom!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn retires into another chamber; bells ring, feet\\nshuffle and patter, silence ensues. Mercury at last begs Mr.\\nTulkinghorn to return.\\n\\n\"Better now,\" quoth Sir Leicester, motioning the lawyer to sit down\\nand read to him alone. \"I have been quite alarmed. I never knew my\\nLady swoon before. But the weather is extremely trying, and she\\nreally has been bored to death down at our place in Lincolnshire.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my portion of\\nthese pages, for I know I am not clever. I always knew that. I can\\nremember, when I was a very little girl indeed, I used to say to my\\ndoll when we were alone together, \"Now, Dolly, I am not clever, you\\nknow very well, and you must be patient with me, like a dear!\" And so\\nshe used to sit propped up in a great arm-chair, with her beautiful\\ncomplexion and rosy lips, staring at me--or not so much at me, I\\nthink, as at nothing--while I busily stitched away and told her every\\none of my secrets.\\n\\nMy dear old doll! I was such a shy little thing that I seldom dared\\nto open my lips, and never dared to open my heart, to anybody else.\\nIt almost makes me cry to think what a relief it used to be to me\\nwhen I came home from school of a day to run upstairs to my room and\\nsay, \"Oh, you dear faithful Dolly, I knew you would be expecting me!\"\\nand then to sit down on the floor, leaning on the elbow of her great\\nchair, and tell her all I had noticed since we parted. I had always\\nrather a noticing way--not a quick way, oh, no!--a silent way of\\nnoticing what passed before me and thinking I should like to\\nunderstand it better. I have not by any means a quick understanding.\\nWhen I love a person very tenderly indeed, it seems to brighten. But\\neven that may be my vanity.\\n\\nI was brought up, from my earliest remembrance--like some of the\\nprincesses in the fairy stories, only I was not charming--by my\\ngodmother. At least, I only knew her as such. She was a good, good\\nwoman! She went to church three times every Sunday, and to morning\\nprayers on Wednesdays and Fridays, and to lectures whenever there\\nwere lectures; and never missed. She was handsome; and if she had\\never smiled, would have been (I used to think) like an angel--but she\\nnever smiled. She was always grave and strict. She was so very good\\nherself, I thought, that the badness of other people made her frown\\nall her life. I felt so different from her, even making every\\nallowance for the differences between a child and a woman; I felt so\\npoor, so trifling, and so far off that I never could be unrestrained\\nwith her--no, could never even love her as I wished. It made me very\\nsorry to consider how good she was and how unworthy of her I was, and\\nI used ardently to hope that I might have a better heart; and I\\ntalked it over very often with the dear old doll, but I never loved\\nmy godmother as I ought to have loved her and as I felt I must have\\nloved her if I had been a better girl.\\n\\nThis made me, I dare say, more timid and retiring than I naturally\\nwas and cast me upon Dolly as the only friend with whom I felt at\\nease. But something happened when I was still quite a little thing\\nthat helped it very much.\\n\\nI had never heard my mama spoken of. I had never heard of my papa\\neither, but I felt more interested about my mama. I had never worn a\\nblack frock, that I could recollect. I had never been shown my mama\\'s\\ngrave. I had never been told where it was. Yet I had never been\\ntaught to pray for any relation but my godmother. I had more than\\nonce approached this subject of my thoughts with Mrs. Rachael, our\\nonly servant, who took my light away when I was in bed (another very\\ngood woman, but austere to me), and she had only said, \"Esther, good\\nnight!\" and gone away and left me.\\n\\nAlthough there were seven girls at the neighbouring school where I\\nwas a day boarder, and although they called me little Esther\\nSummerson, I knew none of them at home. All of them were older than\\nI, to be sure (I was the youngest there by a good deal), but there\\nseemed to be some other separation between us besides that, and\\nbesides their being far more clever than I was and knowing much more\\nthan I did. One of them in the first week of my going to the school\\n(I remember it very well) invited me home to a little party, to my\\ngreat joy. But my godmother wrote a stiff letter declining for me,\\nand I never went. I never went out at all.\\n\\nIt was my birthday. There were holidays at school on other\\nbirthdays--none on mine. There were rejoicings at home on other\\nbirthdays, as I knew from what I heard the girls relate to one\\nanother--there were none on mine. My birthday was the most melancholy\\nday at home in the whole year.\\n\\nI have mentioned that unless my vanity should deceive me (as I know\\nit may, for I may be very vain without suspecting it, though indeed I\\ndon\\'t), my comprehension is quickened when my affection is. My\\ndisposition is very affectionate, and perhaps I might still feel such\\na wound if such a wound could be received more than once with the\\nquickness of that birthday.\\n\\nDinner was over, and my godmother and I were sitting at the table\\nbefore the fire. The clock ticked, the fire clicked; not another\\nsound had been heard in the room or in the house for I don\\'t know how\\nlong. I happened to look timidly up from my stitching, across the\\ntable at my godmother, and I saw in her face, looking gloomily at me,\\n\"It would have been far better, little Esther, that you had had no\\nbirthday, that you had never been born!\"\\n\\nI broke out crying and sobbing, and I said, \"Oh, dear godmother, tell\\nme, pray do tell me, did Mama die on my birthday?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" she returned. \"Ask me no more, child!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, do pray tell me something of her. Do now, at last, dear\\ngodmother, if you please! What did I do to her? How did I lose her?\\nWhy am I so different from other children, and why is it my fault,\\ndear godmother? No, no, no, don\\'t go away. Oh, speak to me!\"\\n\\nI was in a kind of fright beyond my grief, and I caught hold of her\\ndress and was kneeling to her. She had been saying all the while,\\n\"Let me go!\" But now she stood still.\\n\\nHer darkened face had such power over me that it stopped me in the\\nmidst of my vehemence. I put up my trembling little hand to clasp\\nhers or to beg her pardon with what earnestness I might, but withdrew\\nit as she looked at me, and laid it on my fluttering heart. She\\nraised me, sat in her chair, and standing me before her, said slowly\\nin a cold, low voice--I see her knitted brow and pointed\\nfinger--\"Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers.\\nThe time will come--and soon enough--when you will understand this\\nbetter and will feel it too, as no one save a woman can. I have\\nforgiven her\"--but her face did not relent--\"the wrong she did to me,\\nand I say no more of it, though it was greater than you will ever\\nknow--than any one will ever know but I, the sufferer. For yourself,\\nunfortunate girl, orphaned and degraded from the first of these evil\\nanniversaries, pray daily that the sins of others be not visited upon\\nyour head, according to what is written. Forget your mother and leave\\nall other people to forget her who will do her unhappy child that\\ngreatest kindness. Now, go!\"\\n\\nShe checked me, however, as I was about to depart from her--so frozen\\nas I was!--and added this, \"Submission, self-denial, diligent work,\\nare the preparations for a life begun with such a shadow on it. You\\nare different from other children, Esther, because you were not born,\\nlike them, in common sinfulness and wrath. You are set apart.\"\\n\\nI went up to my room, and crept to bed, and laid my doll\\'s cheek\\nagainst mine wet with tears, and holding that solitary friend upon my\\nbosom, cried myself to sleep. Imperfect as my understanding of my\\nsorrow was, I knew that I had brought no joy at any time to anybody\\'s\\nheart and that I was to no one upon earth what Dolly was to me.\\n\\nDear, dear, to think how much time we passed alone together\\nafterwards, and how often I repeated to the doll the story of my\\nbirthday and confided to her that I would try as hard as ever I could\\nto repair the fault I had been born with (of which I confessedly felt\\nguilty and yet innocent) and would strive as I grew up to be\\nindustrious, contented, and kind-hearted and to do some good to some\\none, and win some love to myself if I could. I hope it is not\\nself-indulgent to shed these tears as I think of it. I am very\\nthankful, I am very cheerful, but I cannot quite help their coming to\\nmy eyes.\\n\\nThere! I have wiped them away now and can go on again properly.\\n\\nI felt the distance between my godmother and myself so much more\\nafter the birthday, and felt so sensible of filling a place in her\\nhouse which ought to have been empty, that I found her more difficult\\nof approach, though I was fervently grateful to her in my heart, than\\never. I felt in the same way towards my school companions; I felt in\\nthe same way towards Mrs. Rachael, who was a widow; and oh, towards\\nher daughter, of whom she was proud, who came to see her once a\\nfortnight! I was very retired and quiet, and tried to be very\\ndiligent.\\n\\nOne sunny afternoon when I had come home from school with my books\\nand portfolio, watching my long shadow at my side, and as I was\\ngliding upstairs to my room as usual, my godmother looked out of the\\nparlour-door and called me back. Sitting with her, I found--which was\\nvery unusual indeed--a stranger. A portly, important-looking\\ngentleman, dressed all in black, with a white cravat, large gold\\nwatch seals, a pair of gold eye-glasses, and a large seal-ring upon\\nhis little finger.\\n\\n\"This,\" said my godmother in an undertone, \"is the child.\" Then she\\nsaid in her naturally stern way of speaking, \"This is Esther, sir.\"\\n\\nThe gentleman put up his eye-glasses to look at me and said, \"Come\\nhere, my dear!\" He shook hands with me and asked me to take off my\\nbonnet, looking at me all the while. When I had complied, he said,\\n\"Ah!\" and afterwards \"Yes!\" And then, taking off his eye-glasses and\\nfolding them in a red case, and leaning back in his arm-chair,\\nturning the case about in his two hands, he gave my godmother a nod.\\nUpon that, my godmother said, \"You may go upstairs, Esther!\" And I\\nmade him my curtsy and left him.\\n\\nIt must have been two years afterwards, and I was almost fourteen,\\nwhen one dreadful night my godmother and I sat at the fireside. I was\\nreading aloud, and she was listening. I had come down at nine o\\'clock\\nas I always did to read the Bible to her, and was reading from St.\\nJohn how our Saviour stooped down, writing with his finger in the\\ndust, when they brought the sinful woman to him.\\n\\n\"So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself and said\\nunto them, \\'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a\\nstone at her!\\'\"\\n\\nI was stopped by my godmother\\'s rising, putting her hand to her head,\\nand crying out in an awful voice from quite another part of the book,\\n\"\\'Watch ye, therefore, lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And\\nwhat I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch!\\'\"\\n\\nIn an instant, while she stood before me repeating these words, she\\nfell down on the floor. I had no need to cry out; her voice had\\nsounded through the house and been heard in the street.\\n\\nShe was laid upon her bed. For more than a week she lay there, little\\naltered outwardly, with her old handsome resolute frown that I so\\nwell knew carved upon her face. Many and many a time, in the day and\\nin the night, with my head upon the pillow by her that my whispers\\nmight be plainer to her, I kissed her, thanked her, prayed for her,\\nasked her for her blessing and forgiveness, entreated her to give me\\nthe least sign that she knew or heard me. No, no, no. Her face was\\nimmovable. To the very last, and even afterwards, her frown remained\\nunsoftened.\\n\\nOn the day after my poor good godmother was buried, the gentleman in\\nblack with the white neckcloth reappeared. I was sent for by Mrs.\\nRachael, and found him in the same place, as if he had never gone\\naway.\\n\\n\"My name is Kenge,\" he said; \"you may remember it, my child; Kenge\\nand Carboy, Lincoln\\'s Inn.\"\\n\\nI replied that I remembered to have seen him once before.\\n\\n\"Pray be seated--here near me. Don\\'t distress yourself; it\\'s of no\\nuse. Mrs. Rachael, I needn\\'t inform you who were acquainted with the\\nlate Miss Barbary\\'s affairs, that her means die with her and that\\nthis young lady, now her aunt is dead--\"\\n\\n\"My aunt, sir!\"\\n\\n\"It is really of no use carrying on a deception when no object is to\\nbe gained by it,\" said Mr. Kenge smoothly, \"Aunt in fact, though not\\nin law. Don\\'t distress yourself! Don\\'t weep! Don\\'t tremble! Mrs.\\nRachael, our young friend has no doubt heard of--the--a--Jarndyce and\\nJarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Never,\" said Mrs. Rachael.\\n\\n\"Is it possible,\" pursued Mr. Kenge, putting up his eye-glasses,\\n\"that our young friend--I BEG you won\\'t distress yourself!--never\\nheard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce!\"\\n\\nI shook my head, wondering even what it was.\\n\\n\"Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce?\" said Mr. Kenge, looking over his\\nglasses at me and softly turning the case about and about as if he\\nwere petting something. \"Not of one of the greatest Chancery suits\\nknown? Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce--the--a--in itself a monument of\\nChancery practice. In which (I would say) every difficulty, every\\ncontingency, every masterly fiction, every form of procedure known\\nin that court, is represented over and over again? It is a cause\\nthat could not exist out of this free and great country. I should\\nsay that the aggregate of costs in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mrs.\\nRachael\"--I was afraid he addressed himself to her because I appeared\\ninattentive\"--amounts at the present hour to from SIX-ty to SEVEN-ty\\nTHOUSAND POUNDS!\" said Mr. Kenge, leaning back in his chair.\\n\\nI felt very ignorant, but what could I do? I was so entirely\\nunacquainted with the subject that I understood nothing about it even\\nthen.\\n\\n\"And she really never heard of the cause!\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\"Surprising!\"\\n\\n\"Miss Barbary, sir,\" returned Mrs. Rachael, \"who is now among the\\nSeraphim--\"\\n\\n\"I hope so, I am sure,\" said Mr. Kenge politely.\\n\\n\"--Wished Esther only to know what would be serviceable to her. And\\nshe knows, from any teaching she has had here, nothing more.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Upon the whole, very proper. Now to the\\npoint,\" addressing me. \"Miss Barbary, your sole relation (in fact\\nthat is, for I am bound to observe that in law you had none) being\\ndeceased and it naturally not being to be expected that Mrs.\\nRachael--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear no!\" said Mrs. Rachael quickly.\\n\\n\"Quite so,\" assented Mr. Kenge; \"--that Mrs. Rachael should charge\\nherself with your maintenance and support (I beg you won\\'t distress\\nyourself), you are in a position to receive the renewal of an offer\\nwhich I was instructed to make to Miss Barbary some two years ago and\\nwhich, though rejected then, was understood to be renewable under the\\nlamentable circumstances that have since occurred. Now, if I avow\\nthat I represent, in Jarndyce and Jarndyce and otherwise, a highly\\nhumane, but at the same time singular, man, shall I compromise myself\\nby any stretch of my professional caution?\" said Mr. Kenge, leaning\\nback in his chair again and looking calmly at us both.\\n\\nHe appeared to enjoy beyond everything the sound of his own voice. I\\ncouldn\\'t wonder at that, for it was mellow and full and gave great\\nimportance to every word he uttered. He listened to himself with\\nobvious satisfaction and sometimes gently beat time to his own music\\nwith his head or rounded a sentence with his hand. I was very much\\nimpressed by him--even then, before I knew that he formed himself on\\nthe model of a great lord who was his client and that he was\\ngenerally called Conversation Kenge.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he pursued, \"being aware of the--I would say,\\ndesolate--position of our young friend, offers to place her at a\\nfirst-rate establishment where her education shall be completed,\\nwhere her comfort shall be secured, where her reasonable wants shall\\nbe anticipated, where she shall be eminently qualified to discharge\\nher duty in that station of life unto which it has pleased--shall I\\nsay Providence?--to call her.\"\\n\\nMy heart was filled so full, both by what he said and by his\\naffecting manner of saying it, that I was not able to speak, though I\\ntried.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he went on, \"makes no condition beyond expressing his\\nexpectation that our young friend will not at any time remove herself\\nfrom the establishment in question without his knowledge and\\nconcurrence. That she will faithfully apply herself to the\\nacquisition of those accomplishments, upon the exercise of which she\\nwill be ultimately dependent. That she will tread in the paths of\\nvirtue and honour, and--the--a--so forth.\"\\n\\nI was still less able to speak than before.\\n\\n\"Now, what does our young friend say?\" proceeded Mr. Kenge. \"Take\\ntime, take time! I pause for her reply. But take time!\"\\n\\nWhat the destitute subject of such an offer tried to say, I need not\\nrepeat. What she did say, I could more easily tell, if it were worth\\nthe telling. What she felt, and will feel to her dying hour, I could\\nnever relate.\\n\\nThis interview took place at Windsor, where I had passed (as far as I\\nknew) my whole life. On that day week, amply provided with all\\nnecessaries, I left it, inside the stagecoach, for Reading.\\n\\nMrs. Rachael was too good to feel any emotion at parting, but I was\\nnot so good, and wept bitterly. I thought that I ought to have known\\nher better after so many years and ought to have made myself enough\\nof a favourite with her to make her sorry then. When she gave me one\\ncold parting kiss upon my forehead, like a thaw-drop from the stone\\nporch--it was a very frosty day--I felt so miserable and\\nself-reproachful that I clung to her and told her it was my fault, I\\nknew, that she could say good-bye so easily!\\n\\n\"No, Esther!\" she returned. \"It is your misfortune!\"\\n\\nThe coach was at the little lawn-gate--we had not come out until we\\nheard the wheels--and thus I left her, with a sorrowful heart. She\\nwent in before my boxes were lifted to the coach-roof and shut the\\ndoor. As long as I could see the house, I looked back at it from the\\nwindow through my tears. My godmother had left Mrs. Rachael all the\\nlittle property she possessed; and there was to be a sale; and an old\\nhearth-rug with roses on it, which always seemed to me the first\\nthing in the world I had ever seen, was hanging outside in the frost\\nand snow. A day or two before, I had wrapped the dear old doll in her\\nown shawl and quietly laid her--I am half ashamed to tell it--in the\\ngarden-earth under the tree that shaded my old window. I had no\\ncompanion left but my bird, and him I carried with me in his cage.\\n\\nWhen the house was out of sight, I sat, with my bird-cage in the\\nstraw at my feet, forward on the low seat to look out of the high\\nwindow, watching the frosty trees, that were like beautiful pieces of\\nspar, and the fields all smooth and white with last night\\'s snow, and\\nthe sun, so red but yielding so little heat, and the ice, dark like\\nmetal where the skaters and sliders had brushed the snow away. There\\nwas a gentleman in the coach who sat on the opposite seat and looked\\nvery large in a quantity of wrappings, but he sat gazing out of the\\nother window and took no notice of me.\\n\\nI thought of my dead godmother, of the night when I read to her, of\\nher frowning so fixedly and sternly in her bed, of the strange place\\nI was going to, of the people I should find there, and what they\\nwould be like, and what they would say to me, when a voice in the\\ncoach gave me a terrible start.\\n\\nIt said, \"What the de-vil are you crying for?\"\\n\\nI was so frightened that I lost my voice and could only answer in a\\nwhisper, \"Me, sir?\" For of course I knew it must have been the\\ngentleman in the quantity of wrappings, though he was still looking\\nout of his window.\\n\\n\"Yes, you,\" he said, turning round.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know I was crying, sir,\" I faltered.\\n\\n\"But you are!\" said the gentleman. \"Look here!\" He came quite\\nopposite to me from the other corner of the coach, brushed one of his\\nlarge furry cuffs across my eyes (but without hurting me), and showed\\nme that it was wet.\\n\\n\"There! Now you know you are,\" he said. \"Don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said.\\n\\n\"And what are you crying for?\" said the gentleman, \"Don\\'t you want to\\ngo there?\"\\n\\n\"Where, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Where? Why, wherever you are going,\" said the gentleman.\\n\\n\"I am very glad to go there, sir,\" I answered.\\n\\n\"Well, then! Look glad!\" said the gentleman.\\n\\nI thought he was very strange, or at least that what I could see of\\nhim was very strange, for he was wrapped up to the chin, and his face\\nwas almost hidden in a fur cap with broad fur straps at the side of\\nhis head fastened under his chin; but I was composed again, and not\\nafraid of him. So I told him that I thought I must have been crying\\nbecause of my godmother\\'s death and because of Mrs. Rachael\\'s not\\nbeing sorry to part with me.\\n\\n\"Confound Mrs. Rachael!\" said the gentleman. \"Let her fly away in a\\nhigh wind on a broomstick!\"\\n\\nI began to be really afraid of him now and looked at him with the\\ngreatest astonishment. But I thought that he had pleasant eyes,\\nalthough he kept on muttering to himself in an angry manner and\\ncalling Mrs. Rachael names.\\n\\nAfter a little while he opened his outer wrapper, which appeared to\\nme large enough to wrap up the whole coach, and put his arm down into\\na deep pocket in the side.\\n\\n\"Now, look here!\" he said. \"In this paper,\" which was nicely folded,\\n\"is a piece of the best plum-cake that can be got for money--sugar on\\nthe outside an inch thick, like fat on mutton chops. Here\\'s a little\\npie (a gem this is, both for size and quality), made in France. And\\nwhat do you suppose it\\'s made of? Livers of fat geese. There\\'s a pie!\\nNow let\\'s see you eat \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir,\" I replied; \"thank you very much indeed, but I hope\\nyou won\\'t be offended--they are too rich for me.\"\\n\\n\"Floored again!\" said the gentleman, which I didn\\'t at all\\nunderstand, and threw them both out of window.\\n\\nHe did not speak to me any more until he got out of the coach a\\nlittle way short of Reading, when he advised me to be a good girl and\\nto be studious, and shook hands with me. I must say I was relieved by\\nhis departure. We left him at a milestone. I often walked past it\\nafterwards, and never for a long time without thinking of him and\\nhalf expecting to meet him. But I never did; and so, as time went on,\\nhe passed out of my mind.\\n\\nWhen the coach stopped, a very neat lady looked up at the window and\\nsaid, \"Miss Donny.\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, Esther Summerson.\"\\n\\n\"That is quite right,\" said the lady, \"Miss Donny.\"\\n\\nI now understood that she introduced herself by that name, and begged\\nMiss Donny\\'s pardon for my mistake, and pointed out my boxes at her\\nrequest. Under the direction of a very neat maid, they were put\\noutside a very small green carriage; and then Miss Donny, the maid,\\nand I got inside and were driven away.\\n\\n\"Everything is ready for you, Esther,\" said Miss Donny, \"and the\\nscheme of your pursuits has been arranged in exact accordance with\\nthe wishes of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Of--did you say, ma\\'am?\"\\n\\n\"Of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce,\" said Miss Donny.\\n\\nI was so bewildered that Miss Donny thought the cold had been too\\nsevere for me and lent me her smelling-bottle.\\n\\n\"Do you know my--guardian, Mr. Jarndyce, ma\\'am?\" I asked after a good\\ndeal of hesitation.\\n\\n\"Not personally, Esther,\" said Miss Donny; \"merely through his\\nsolicitors, Messrs. Kenge and Carboy, of London. A very superior\\ngentleman, Mr. Kenge. Truly eloquent indeed. Some of his periods\\nquite majestic!\"\\n\\nI felt this to be very true but was too confused to attend to it. Our\\nspeedy arrival at our destination, before I had time to recover\\nmyself, increased my confusion, and I never shall forget the\\nuncertain and the unreal air of everything at Greenleaf (Miss Donny\\'s\\nhouse) that afternoon!\\n\\nBut I soon became used to it. I was so adapted to the routine of\\nGreenleaf before long that I seemed to have been there a great while\\nand almost to have dreamed rather than really lived my old life at my\\ngodmother\\'s. Nothing could be more precise, exact, and orderly than\\nGreenleaf. There was a time for everything all round the dial of the\\nclock, and everything was done at its appointed moment.\\n\\nWe were twelve boarders, and there were two Miss Donnys, twins. It\\nwas understood that I would have to depend, by and by, on my\\nqualifications as a governess, and I was not only instructed in\\neverything that was taught at Greenleaf, but was very soon engaged in\\nhelping to instruct others. Although I was treated in every other\\nrespect like the rest of the school, this single difference was made\\nin my case from the first. As I began to know more, I taught more,\\nand so in course of time I had plenty to do, which I was very fond of\\ndoing because it made the dear girls fond of me. At last, whenever a\\nnew pupil came who was a little downcast and unhappy, she was so\\nsure--indeed I don\\'t know why--to make a friend of me that all\\nnew-comers were confided to my care. They said I was so gentle, but I\\nam sure THEY were! I often thought of the resolution I had made on my\\nbirthday to try to be industrious, contented, and true-hearted and to\\ndo some good to some one and win some love if I could; and indeed,\\nindeed, I felt almost ashamed to have done so little and have won so\\nmuch.\\n\\nI passed at Greenleaf six happy, quiet years. I never saw in any face\\nthere, thank heaven, on my birthday, that it would have been better\\nif I had never been born. When the day came round, it brought me so\\nmany tokens of affectionate remembrance that my room was beautiful\\nwith them from New Year\\'s Day to Christmas.\\n\\nIn those six years I had never been away except on visits at holiday\\ntime in the neighbourhood. After the first six months or so I had\\ntaken Miss Donny\\'s advice in reference to the propriety of writing to\\nMr. Kenge to say that I was happy and grateful, and with her approval\\nI had written such a letter. I had received a formal answer\\nacknowledging its receipt and saying, \"We note the contents thereof,\\nwhich shall be duly communicated to our client.\" After that I\\nsometimes heard Miss Donny and her sister mention how regular my\\naccounts were paid, and about twice a year I ventured to write a\\nsimilar letter. I always received by return of post exactly the same\\nanswer in the same round hand, with the signature of Kenge and Carboy\\nin another writing, which I supposed to be Mr. Kenge\\'s.\\n\\nIt seems so curious to me to be obliged to write all this about\\nmyself! As if this narrative were the narrative of MY life! But my\\nlittle body will soon fall into the background now.\\n\\nSix quiet years (I find I am saying it for the second time) I had\\npassed at Greenleaf, seeing in those around me, as it might be in a\\nlooking-glass, every stage of my own growth and change there, when,\\none November morning, I received this letter. I omit the date.\\n\\n\\n   Old Square, Lincoln\\'s Inn\\n\\n   Madam,\\n\\n   Jarndyce and Jarndyce\\n\\n   Our clt Mr. Jarndyce being abt to rece into his house,\\n   under an Order of the Ct of Chy, a Ward of the Ct in this\\n   cause, for whom he wishes to secure an elgble compn,\\n   directs us to inform you that he will be glad of your\\n   serces in the afsd capacity.\\n\\n   We have arrngd for your being forded, carriage free, pr\\n   eight o\\'clock coach from Reading, on Monday morning next,\\n   to White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly, London, where one of\\n   our clks will be in waiting to convey you to our offe as\\n   above.\\n\\n   We are, Madam, Your obedt Servts,\\n\\n   Kenge and Carboy\\n\\n   Miss Esther Summerson\\n\\n\\nOh, never, never, never shall I forget the emotion this letter caused\\nin the house! It was so tender in them to care so much for me, it was\\nso gracious in that father who had not forgotten me to have made my\\norphan way so smooth and easy and to have inclined so many youthful\\nnatures towards me, that I could hardly bear it. Not that I would\\nhave had them less sorry--I am afraid not; but the pleasure of it,\\nand the pain of it, and the pride and joy of it, and the humble\\nregret of it were so blended that my heart seemed almost breaking\\nwhile it was full of rapture.\\n\\nThe letter gave me only five days\\' notice of my removal. When every\\nminute added to the proofs of love and kindness that were given me in\\nthose five days, and when at last the morning came and when they took\\nme through all the rooms that I might see them for the last time, and\\nwhen some cried, \"Esther, dear, say good-bye to me here at my\\nbedside, where you first spoke so kindly to me!\" and when others\\nasked me only to write their names, \"With Esther\\'s love,\" and when\\nthey all surrounded me with their parting presents and clung to me\\nweeping and cried, \"What shall we do when dear, dear Esther\\'s gone!\"\\nand when I tried to tell them how forbearing and how good they had\\nall been to me and how I blessed and thanked them every one, what a\\nheart I had!\\n\\nAnd when the two Miss Donnys grieved as much to part with me as the\\nleast among them, and when the maids said, \"Bless you, miss, wherever\\nyou go!\" and when the ugly lame old gardener, who I thought had\\nhardly noticed me in all those years, came panting after the coach to\\ngive me a little nosegay of geraniums and told me I had been the\\nlight of his eyes--indeed the old man said so!--what a heart I had\\nthen!\\n\\nAnd could I help it if with all this, and the coming to the little\\nschool, and the unexpected sight of the poor children outside waving\\ntheir hats and bonnets to me, and of a grey-haired gentleman and lady\\nwhose daughter I had helped to teach and at whose house I had visited\\n(who were said to be the proudest people in all that country), caring\\nfor nothing but calling out, \"Good-bye, Esther. May you be very\\nhappy!\"--could I help it if I was quite bowed down in the coach by\\nmyself and said \"Oh, I am so thankful, I am so thankful!\" many times\\nover!\\n\\nBut of course I soon considered that I must not take tears where I\\nwas going after all that had been done for me. Therefore, of course,\\nI made myself sob less and persuaded myself to be quiet by saying\\nvery often, \"Esther, now you really must! This WILL NOT do!\" I\\ncheered myself up pretty well at last, though I am afraid I was\\nlonger about it than I ought to have been; and when I had cooled my\\neyes with lavender water, it was time to watch for London.\\n\\nI was quite persuaded that we were there when we were ten miles off,\\nand when we really were there, that we should never get there.\\nHowever, when we began to jolt upon a stone pavement, and\\nparticularly when every other conveyance seemed to be running into\\nus, and we seemed to be running into every other conveyance, I began\\nto believe that we really were approaching the end of our journey.\\nVery soon afterwards we stopped.\\n\\nA young gentleman who had inked himself by accident addressed me from\\nthe pavement and said, \"I am from Kenge and Carboy\\'s, miss, of\\nLincoln\\'s Inn.\"\\n\\n\"If you please, sir,\" said I.\\n\\nHe was very obliging, and as he handed me into a fly after\\nsuperintending the removal of my boxes, I asked him whether there was\\na great fire anywhere? For the streets were so full of dense brown\\nsmoke that scarcely anything was to be seen.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear no, miss,\" he said. \"This is a London particular.\"\\n\\nI had never heard of such a thing.\\n\\n\"A fog, miss,\" said the young gentleman.\\n\\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said I.\\n\\nWe drove slowly through the dirtiest and darkest streets that ever\\nwere seen in the world (I thought) and in such a distracting state of\\nconfusion that I wondered how the people kept their senses, until we\\npassed into sudden quietude under an old gateway and drove on through\\na silent square until we came to an odd nook in a corner, where there\\nwas an entrance up a steep, broad flight of stairs, like an entrance\\nto a church. And there really was a churchyard outside under some\\ncloisters, for I saw the gravestones from the staircase window.\\n\\nThis was Kenge and Carboy\\'s. The young gentleman showed me through an\\nouter office into Mr. Kenge\\'s room--there was no one in it--and\\npolitely put an arm-chair for me by the fire. He then called my\\nattention to a little looking-glass hanging from a nail on one side\\nof the chimney-piece.\\n\\n\"In case you should wish to look at yourself, miss, after the\\njourney, as you\\'re going before the Chancellor. Not that it\\'s\\nrequisite, I am sure,\" said the young gentleman civilly.\\n\\n\"Going before the Chancellor?\" I said, startled for a moment.\\n\\n\"Only a matter of form, miss,\" returned the young gentleman. \"Mr.\\nKenge is in court now. He left his compliments, and would you partake\\nof some refreshment\"--there were biscuits and a decanter of wine on a\\nsmall table--\"and look over the paper,\" which the young gentleman\\ngave me as he spoke. He then stirred the fire and left me.\\n\\nEverything was so strange--the stranger from its being night in the\\nday-time, the candles burning with a white flame, and looking raw and\\ncold--that I read the words in the newspaper without knowing what\\nthey meant and found myself reading the same words repeatedly. As it\\nwas of no use going on in that way, I put the paper down, took a peep\\nat my bonnet in the glass to see if it was neat, and looked at the\\nroom, which was not half lighted, and at the shabby, dusty tables,\\nand at the piles of writings, and at a bookcase full of the most\\ninexpressive-looking books that ever had anything to say for\\nthemselves. Then I went on, thinking, thinking, thinking; and the\\nfire went on, burning, burning, burning; and the candles went on\\nflickering and guttering, and there were no snuffers--until the young\\ngentleman by and by brought a very dirty pair--for two hours.\\n\\nAt last Mr. Kenge came. HE was not altered, but he was surprised to\\nsee how altered I was and appeared quite pleased. \"As you are going\\nto be the companion of the young lady who is now in the Chancellor\\'s\\nprivate room, Miss Summerson,\" he said, \"we thought it well that you\\nshould be in attendance also. You will not be discomposed by the Lord\\nChancellor, I dare say?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" I said, \"I don\\'t think I shall,\" really not seeing on\\nconsideration why I should be.\\n\\nSo Mr. Kenge gave me his arm and we went round the corner, under a\\ncolonnade, and in at a side door. And so we came, along a passage,\\ninto a comfortable sort of room where a young lady and a young\\ngentleman were standing near a great, loud-roaring fire. A screen was\\ninterposed between them and it, and they were leaning on the screen,\\ntalking.\\n\\nThey both looked up when I came in, and I saw in the young lady, with\\nthe fire shining upon her, such a beautiful girl! With such rich\\ngolden hair, such soft blue eyes, and such a bright, innocent,\\ntrusting face!\\n\\n\"Miss Ada,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"this is Miss Summerson.\"\\n\\nShe came to meet me with a smile of welcome and her hand extended,\\nbut seemed to change her mind in a moment and kissed me. In short,\\nshe had such a natural, captivating, winning manner that in a few\\nminutes we were sitting in the window-seat, with the light of the\\nfire upon us, talking together as free and happy as could be.\\n\\nWhat a load off my mind! It was so delightful to know that she could\\nconfide in me and like me! It was so good of her, and so encouraging\\nto me!\\n\\nThe young gentleman was her distant cousin, she told me, and his name\\nRichard Carstone. He was a handsome youth with an ingenuous face and\\na most engaging laugh; and after she had called him up to where we\\nsat, he stood by us, in the light of the fire, talking gaily, like a\\nlight-hearted boy. He was very young, not more than nineteen then, if\\nquite so much, but nearly two years older than she was. They were\\nboth orphans and (what was very unexpected and curious to me) had\\nnever met before that day. Our all three coming together for the\\nfirst time in such an unusual place was a thing to talk about, and we\\ntalked about it; and the fire, which had left off roaring, winked its\\nred eyes at us--as Richard said--like a drowsy old Chancery lion.\\n\\nWe conversed in a low tone because a full-dressed gentleman in a bag\\nwig frequently came in and out, and when he did so, we could hear a\\ndrawling sound in the distance, which he said was one of the counsel\\nin our case addressing the Lord Chancellor. He told Mr. Kenge that\\nthe Chancellor would be up in five minutes; and presently we heard a\\nbustle and a tread of feet, and Mr. Kenge said that the Court had\\nrisen and his lordship was in the next room.\\n\\nThe gentleman in the bag wig opened the door almost directly and\\nrequested Mr. Kenge to come in. Upon that, we all went into the next\\nroom, Mr. Kenge first, with my darling--it is so natural to me now\\nthat I can\\'t help writing it; and there, plainly dressed in black and\\nsitting in an arm-chair at a table near the fire, was his lordship,\\nwhose robe, trimmed with beautiful gold lace, was thrown upon another\\nchair. He gave us a searching look as we entered, but his manner was\\nboth courtly and kind.\\n\\nThe gentleman in the bag wig laid bundles of papers on his lordship\\'s\\ntable, and his lordship silently selected one and turned over the\\nleaves.\\n\\n\"Miss Clare,\" said the Lord Chancellor. \"Miss Ada Clare?\"\\n\\nMr. Kenge presented her, and his lordship begged her to sit down near\\nhim. That he admired her and was interested by her even I could see\\nin a moment. It touched me that the home of such a beautiful young\\ncreature should be represented by that dry, official place. The Lord\\nHigh Chancellor, at his best, appeared so poor a substitute for the\\nlove and pride of parents.\\n\\n\"The Jarndyce in question,\" said the Lord Chancellor, still turning\\nover leaves, \"is Jarndyce of Bleak House.\"\\n\\n\"Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\\n\"A dreary name,\" said the Lord Chancellor.\\n\\n\"But not a dreary place at present, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\\n\"And Bleak House,\" said his lordship, \"is in--\"\\n\\n\"Hertfordshire, my lord.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House is not married?\" said his lordship.\\n\\n\"He is not, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\\nA pause.\\n\\n\"Young Mr. Richard Carstone is present?\" said the Lord Chancellor,\\nglancing towards him.\\n\\nRichard bowed and stepped forward.\\n\\n\"Hum!\" said the Lord Chancellor, turning over more leaves.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,\" Mr. Kenge observed in a low\\nvoice, \"if I may venture to remind your lordship, provides a suitable\\ncompanion for--\"\\n\\n\"For Mr. Richard Carstone?\" I thought (but I am not quite sure) I\\nheard his lordship say in an equally low voice and with a smile.\\n\\n\"For Miss Ada Clare. This is the young lady. Miss Summerson.\"\\n\\nHis lordship gave me an indulgent look and acknowledged my curtsy\\nvery graciously.\\n\\n\"Miss Summerson is not related to any party in the cause, I think?\"\\n\\n\"No, my lord.\"\\n\\nMr. Kenge leant over before it was quite said and whispered. His\\nlordship, with his eyes upon his papers, listened, nodded twice or\\nthrice, turned over more leaves, and did not look towards me again\\nuntil we were going away.\\n\\nMr. Kenge now retired, and Richard with him, to where I was, near the\\ndoor, leaving my pet (it is so natural to me that again I can\\'t help\\nit!) sitting near the Lord Chancellor, with whom his lordship spoke a\\nlittle part, asking her, as she told me afterwards, whether she had\\nwell reflected on the proposed arrangement, and if she thought she\\nwould be happy under the roof of Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, and why\\nshe thought so? Presently he rose courteously and released her, and\\nthen he spoke for a minute or two with Richard Carstone, not seated,\\nbut standing, and altogether with more ease and less ceremony, as if\\nhe still knew, though he WAS Lord Chancellor, how to go straight to\\nthe candour of a boy.\\n\\n\"Very well!\" said his lordship aloud. \"I shall make the order. Mr.\\nJarndyce of Bleak House has chosen, so far as I may judge,\" and this\\nwas when he looked at me, \"a very good companion for the young lady,\\nand the arrangement altogether seems the best of which the\\ncircumstances admit.\"\\n\\nHe dismissed us pleasantly, and we all went out, very much obliged to\\nhim for being so affable and polite, by which he had certainly lost\\nno dignity but seemed to us to have gained some.\\n\\nWhen we got under the colonnade, Mr. Kenge remembered that he must go\\nback for a moment to ask a question and left us in the fog, with the\\nLord Chancellor\\'s carriage and servants waiting for him to come out.\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Richard Carstone. \"THAT\\'S over! And where do we go next,\\nMiss Summerson?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you know?\" I said.\\n\\n\"Not in the least,\" said he.\\n\\n\"And don\\'t YOU know, my love?\" I asked Ada.\\n\\n\"No!\" said she. \"Don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all!\" said I.\\n\\nWe looked at one another, half laughing at our being like the\\nchildren in the wood, when a curious little old woman in a squeezed\\nbonnet and carrying a reticule came curtsying and smiling up to us\\nwith an air of great ceremony.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said she. \"The wards in Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy, I am sure, to\\nhave the honour! It is a good omen for youth, and hope, and beauty\\nwhen they find themselves in this place, and don\\'t know what\\'s to\\ncome of it.\"\\n\\n\"Mad!\" whispered Richard, not thinking she could hear him.\\n\\n\"Right! Mad, young gentleman,\" she returned so quickly that he was\\nquite abashed. \"I was a ward myself. I was not mad at that time,\"\\ncurtsying low and smiling between every little sentence. \"I had youth\\nand hope. I believe, beauty. It matters very little now. Neither of\\nthe three served or saved me. I have the honour to attend court\\nregularly. With my documents. I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the\\nDay of Judgment. I have discovered that the sixth seal mentioned in\\nthe Revelations is the Great Seal. It has been open a long time! Pray\\naccept my blessing.\"\\n\\nAs Ada was a little frightened, I said, to humour the poor old lady,\\nthat we were much obliged to her.\\n\\n\"Ye-es!\" she said mincingly. \"I imagine so. And here is Conversation\\nKenge. With HIS documents! How does your honourable worship do?\"\\n\\n\"Quite well, quite well! Now don\\'t be troublesome, that\\'s a good\\nsoul!\" said Mr. Kenge, leading the way back.\\n\\n\"By no means,\" said the poor old lady, keeping up with Ada and me.\\n\"Anything but troublesome. I shall confer estates on both--which is\\nnot being troublesome, I trust? I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the\\nDay of Judgment. This is a good omen for you. Accept my blessing!\"\\n\\nShe stopped at the bottom of the steep, broad flight of stairs; but\\nwe looked back as we went up, and she was still there, saying, still\\nwith a curtsy and a smile between every little sentence, \"Youth. And\\nhope. And beauty. And Chancery. And Conversation Kenge! Ha! Pray\\naccept my blessing!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWe were to pass the night, Mr. Kenge told us when we arrived in his\\nroom, at Mrs. Jellyby\\'s; and then he turned to me and said he took it\\nfor granted I knew who Mrs. Jellyby was.\\n\\n\"I really don\\'t, sir,\" I returned. \"Perhaps Mr. Carstone--or Miss\\nClare--\"\\n\\nBut no, they knew nothing whatever about Mrs. Jellyby. \"In-deed! Mrs.\\nJellyby,\" said Mr. Kenge, standing with his back to the fire and\\ncasting his eyes over the dusty hearth-rug as if it were Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s biography, \"is a lady of very remarkable strength of\\ncharacter who devotes herself entirely to the public. She has devoted\\nherself to an extensive variety of public subjects at various times\\nand is at present (until something else attracts her) devoted to the\\nsubject of Africa, with a view to the general cultivation of the\\ncoffee berry--AND the natives--and the happy settlement, on the banks\\nof the African rivers, of our superabundant home population. Mr.\\nJarndyce, who is desirous to aid any work that is considered likely\\nto be a good work and who is much sought after by philanthropists,\\nhas, I believe, a very high opinion of Mrs. Jellyby.\"\\n\\nMr. Kenge, adjusting his cravat, then looked at us.\\n\\n\"And Mr. Jellyby, sir?\" suggested Richard.\\n\\n\"Ah! Mr. Jellyby,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"is--a--I don\\'t know that I can\\ndescribe him to you better than by saying that he is the husband of\\nMrs. Jellyby.\"\\n\\n\"A nonentity, sir?\" said Richard with a droll look.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t say that,\" returned Mr. Kenge gravely. \"I can\\'t say that,\\nindeed, for I know nothing whatever OF Mr. Jellyby. I never, to my\\nknowledge, had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jellyby. He may be a very\\nsuperior man, but he is, so to speak, merged--merged--in the more\\nshining qualities of his wife.\" Mr. Kenge proceeded to tell us that\\nas the road to Bleak House would have been very long, dark, and\\ntedious on such an evening, and as we had been travelling already,\\nMr. Jarndyce had himself proposed this arrangement. A carriage would\\nbe at Mrs. Jellyby\\'s to convey us out of town early in the forenoon\\nof to-morrow.\\n\\nHe then rang a little bell, and the young gentleman came in.\\nAddressing him by the name of Guppy, Mr. Kenge inquired whether Miss\\nSummerson\\'s boxes and the rest of the baggage had been \"sent round.\"\\nMr. Guppy said yes, they had been sent round, and a coach was waiting\\nto take us round too as soon as we pleased.\\n\\n\"Then it only remains,\" said Mr. Kenge, shaking hands with us, \"for\\nme to express my lively satisfaction in (good day, Miss Clare!) the\\narrangement this day concluded and my (GOOD-bye to you, Miss\\nSummerson!) lively hope that it will conduce to the happiness, the\\n(glad to have had the honour of making your acquaintance, Mr.\\nCarstone!) welfare, the advantage in all points of view, of all\\nconcerned! Guppy, see the party safely there.\"\\n\\n\"Where IS \\'there,\\' Mr. Guppy?\" said Richard as we went downstairs.\\n\\n\"No distance,\" said Mr. Guppy; \"round in Thavies Inn, you know.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t say I know where it is, for I come from Winchester and am\\nstrange in London.\"\\n\\n\"Only round the corner,\" said Mr. Guppy. \"We just twist up Chancery\\nLane, and cut along Holborn, and there we are in four minutes\\' time,\\nas near as a toucher. This is about a London particular NOW, ain\\'t\\nit, miss?\" He seemed quite delighted with it on my account.\\n\\n\"The fog is very dense indeed!\" said I.\\n\\n\"Not that it affects you, though, I\\'m sure,\" said Mr. Guppy, putting\\nup the steps. \"On the contrary, it seems to do you good, miss,\\njudging from your appearance.\"\\n\\nI knew he meant well in paying me this compliment, so I laughed at\\nmyself for blushing at it when he had shut the door and got upon the\\nbox; and we all three laughed and chatted about our inexperience and\\nthe strangeness of London until we turned up under an archway to our\\ndestination--a narrow street of high houses like an oblong cistern to\\nhold the fog. There was a confused little crowd of people,\\nprincipally children, gathered about the house at which we stopped,\\nwhich had a tarnished brass plate on the door with the inscription\\nJELLYBY.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be frightened!\" said Mr. Guppy, looking in at the\\ncoach-window. \"One of the young Jellybys been and got his head\\nthrough the area railings!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, poor child,\" said I; \"let me out, if you please!\"\\n\\n\"Pray be careful of yourself, miss. The young Jellybys are always up\\nto something,\" said Mr. Guppy.\\n\\nI made my way to the poor child, who was one of the dirtiest little\\nunfortunates I ever saw, and found him very hot and frightened and\\ncrying loudly, fixed by the neck between two iron railings, while a\\nmilkman and a beadle, with the kindest intentions possible, were\\nendeavouring to drag him back by the legs, under a general impression\\nthat his skull was compressible by those means. As I found (after\\npacifying him) that he was a little boy with a naturally large head,\\nI thought that perhaps where his head could go, his body could\\nfollow, and mentioned that the best mode of extrication might be to\\npush him forward. This was so favourably received by the milkman and\\nbeadle that he would immediately have been pushed into the area if I\\nhad not held his pinafore while Richard and Mr. Guppy ran down\\nthrough the kitchen to catch him when he should be released. At last\\nhe was happily got down without any accident, and then he began to\\nbeat Mr. Guppy with a hoop-stick in quite a frantic manner.\\n\\nNobody had appeared belonging to the house except a person in\\npattens, who had been poking at the child from below with a broom; I\\ndon\\'t know with what object, and I don\\'t think she did. I therefore\\nsupposed that Mrs. Jellyby was not at home, and was quite surprised\\nwhen the person appeared in the passage without the pattens, and\\ngoing up to the back room on the first floor before Ada and me,\\nannounced us as, \"Them two young ladies, Missis Jellyby!\" We passed\\nseveral more children on the way up, whom it was difficult to avoid\\ntreading on in the dark; and as we came into Mrs. Jellyby\\'s presence,\\none of the poor little things fell downstairs--down a whole flight\\n(as it sounded to me), with a great noise.\\n\\nMrs. Jellyby, whose face reflected none of the uneasiness which we\\ncould not help showing in our own faces as the dear child\\'s head\\nrecorded its passage with a bump on every stair--Richard afterwards\\nsaid he counted seven, besides one for the landing--received us with\\nperfect equanimity. She was a pretty, very diminutive, plump woman of\\nfrom forty to fifty, with handsome eyes, though they had a curious\\nhabit of seeming to look a long way off. As if--I am quoting Richard\\nagain--they could see nothing nearer than Africa!\\n\\n\"I am very glad indeed,\" said Mrs. Jellyby in an agreeable voice, \"to\\nhave the pleasure of receiving you. I have a great respect for Mr.\\nJarndyce, and no one in whom he is interested can be an object of\\nindifference to me.\"\\n\\nWe expressed our acknowledgments and sat down behind the door, where\\nthere was a lame invalid of a sofa. Mrs. Jellyby had very good hair\\nbut was too much occupied with her African duties to brush it. The\\nshawl in which she had been loosely muffled dropped onto her chair\\nwhen she advanced to us; and as she turned to resume her seat, we\\ncould not help noticing that her dress didn\\'t nearly meet up the back\\nand that the open space was railed across with a lattice-work of\\nstay-lace--like a summer-house.\\n\\nThe room, which was strewn with papers and nearly filled by a great\\nwriting-table covered with similar litter, was, I must say, not only\\nvery untidy but very dirty. We were obliged to take notice of that\\nwith our sense of sight, even while, with our sense of hearing, we\\nfollowed the poor child who had tumbled downstairs: I think into the\\nback kitchen, where somebody seemed to stifle him.\\n\\nBut what principally struck us was a jaded and unhealthy-looking\\nthough by no means plain girl at the writing-table, who sat biting\\nthe feather of her pen and staring at us. I suppose nobody ever was\\nin such a state of ink. And from her tumbled hair to her pretty feet,\\nwhich were disfigured with frayed and broken satin slippers trodden\\ndown at heel, she really seemed to have no article of dress upon her,\\nfrom a pin upwards, that was in its proper condition or its right\\nplace.\\n\\n\"You find me, my dears,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, snuffing the two great\\noffice candles in tin candlesticks, which made the room taste\\nstrongly of hot tallow (the fire had gone out, and there was nothing\\nin the grate but ashes, a bundle of wood, and a poker), \"you find me,\\nmy dears, as usual, very busy; but that you will excuse. The African\\nproject at present employs my whole time. It involves me in\\ncorrespondence with public bodies and with private individuals\\nanxious for the welfare of their species all over the country. I am\\nhappy to say it is advancing. We hope by this time next year to have\\nfrom a hundred and fifty to two hundred healthy families cultivating\\ncoffee and educating the natives of Borrioboola-Gha, on the left bank\\nof the Niger.\"\\n\\nAs Ada said nothing, but looked at me, I said it must be very\\ngratifying.\\n\\n\"It IS gratifying,\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"It involves the devotion of\\nall my energies, such as they are; but that is nothing, so that it\\nsucceeds; and I am more confident of success every day. Do you know,\\nMiss Summerson, I almost wonder that YOU never turned your thoughts\\nto Africa.\"\\n\\nThis application of the subject was really so unexpected to me that I\\nwas quite at a loss how to receive it. I hinted that the climate--\\n\\n\"The finest climate in the world!\" said Mrs. Jellyby.\\n\\n\"Indeed, ma\\'am?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. With precaution,\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"You may go into\\nHolborn, without precaution, and be run over. You may go into\\nHolborn, with precaution, and never be run over. Just so with\\nAfrica.\"\\n\\nI said, \"No doubt.\" I meant as to Holborn.\\n\\n\"If you would like,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, putting a number of papers\\ntowards us, \"to look over some remarks on that head, and on the\\ngeneral subject, which have been extensively circulated, while I\\nfinish a letter I am now dictating to my eldest daughter, who is my\\namanuensis--\"\\n\\nThe girl at the table left off biting her pen and made a return to\\nour recognition, which was half bashful and half sulky.\\n\\n\"--I shall then have finished for the present,\" proceeded Mrs.\\nJellyby with a sweet smile, \"though my work is never done. Where are\\nyou, Caddy?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Presents her compliments to Mr. Swallow, and begs--\\'\" said Caddy.\\n\\n\"\\'And begs,\\'\" said Mrs. Jellyby, dictating, \"\\'to inform him, in\\nreference to his letter of inquiry on the African project--\\' No,\\nPeepy! Not on my account!\"\\n\\nPeepy (so self-named) was the unfortunate child who had fallen\\ndownstairs, who now interrupted the correspondence by presenting\\nhimself, with a strip of plaster on his forehead, to exhibit his\\nwounded knees, in which Ada and I did not know which to pity\\nmost--the bruises or the dirt. Mrs. Jellyby merely added, with the\\nserene composure with which she said everything, \"Go along, you\\nnaughty Peepy!\" and fixed her fine eyes on Africa again.\\n\\nHowever, as she at once proceeded with her dictation, and as I\\ninterrupted nothing by doing it, I ventured quietly to stop poor\\nPeepy as he was going out and to take him up to nurse. He looked very\\nmuch astonished at it and at Ada\\'s kissing him, but soon fell fast\\nasleep in my arms, sobbing at longer and longer intervals, until he\\nwas quiet. I was so occupied with Peepy that I lost the letter in\\ndetail, though I derived such a general impression from it of the\\nmomentous importance of Africa, and the utter insignificance of all\\nother places and things, that I felt quite ashamed to have thought so\\nlittle about it.\\n\\n\"Six o\\'clock!\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"And our dinner hour is nominally\\n(for we dine at all hours) five! Caddy, show Miss Clare and Miss\\nSummerson their rooms. You will like to make some change, perhaps?\\nYou will excuse me, I know, being so much occupied. Oh, that very bad\\nchild! Pray put him down, Miss Summerson!\"\\n\\nI begged permission to retain him, truly saying that he was not at\\nall troublesome, and carried him upstairs and laid him on my bed. Ada\\nand I had two upper rooms with a door of communication between. They\\nwere excessively bare and disorderly, and the curtain to my window\\nwas fastened up with a fork.\\n\\n\"You would like some hot water, wouldn\\'t you?\" said Miss Jellyby,\\nlooking round for a jug with a handle to it, but looking in vain.\\n\\n\"If it is not being troublesome,\" said we.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s not the trouble,\" returned Miss Jellyby; \"the question is,\\nif there IS any.\"\\n\\nThe evening was so very cold and the rooms had such a marshy smell\\nthat I must confess it was a little miserable, and Ada was half\\ncrying. We soon laughed, however, and were busily unpacking when Miss\\nJellyby came back to say that she was sorry there was no hot water,\\nbut they couldn\\'t find the kettle, and the boiler was out of order.\\n\\nWe begged her not to mention it and made all the haste we could to\\nget down to the fire again. But all the little children had come up\\nto the landing outside to look at the phenomenon of Peepy lying on my\\nbed, and our attention was distracted by the constant apparition of\\nnoses and fingers in situations of danger between the hinges of the\\ndoors. It was impossible to shut the door of either room, for my\\nlock, with no knob to it, looked as if it wanted to be wound up; and\\nthough the handle of Ada\\'s went round and round with the greatest\\nsmoothness, it was attended with no effect whatever on the door.\\nTherefore I proposed to the children that they should come in and be\\nvery good at my table, and I would tell them the story of Little Red\\nRiding Hood while I dressed; which they did, and were as quiet as\\nmice, including Peepy, who awoke opportunely before the appearance of\\nthe wolf.\\n\\nWhen we went downstairs we found a mug with \"A Present from Tunbridge\\nWells\" on it lighted up in the staircase window with a floating wick,\\nand a young woman, with a swelled face bound up in a flannel bandage\\nblowing the fire of the drawing-room (now connected by an open door\\nwith Mrs. Jellyby\\'s room) and choking dreadfully. It smoked to that\\ndegree, in short, that we all sat coughing and crying with the\\nwindows open for half an hour, during which Mrs. Jellyby, with the\\nsame sweetness of temper, directed letters about Africa. Her being so\\nemployed was, I must say, a great relief to me, for Richard told us\\nthat he had washed his hands in a pie-dish and that they had found\\nthe kettle on his dressing-table, and he made Ada laugh so that they\\nmade me laugh in the most ridiculous manner.\\n\\nSoon after seven o\\'clock we went down to dinner, carefully, by Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s advice, for the stair-carpets, besides being very deficient\\nin stair-wires, were so torn as to be absolute traps. We had a fine\\ncod-fish, a piece of roast beef, a dish of cutlets, and a pudding; an\\nexcellent dinner, if it had had any cooking to speak of, but it was\\nalmost raw. The young woman with the flannel bandage waited, and\\ndropped everything on the table wherever it happened to go, and never\\nmoved it again until she put it on the stairs. The person I had seen\\nin pattens, who I suppose to have been the cook, frequently came and\\nskirmished with her at the door, and there appeared to be ill will\\nbetween them.\\n\\nAll through dinner--which was long, in consequence of such accidents\\nas the dish of potatoes being mislaid in the coal skuttle and the\\nhandle of the corkscrew coming off and striking the young woman in\\nthe chin--Mrs. Jellyby preserved the evenness of her disposition. She\\ntold us a great deal that was interesting about Borrioboola-Gha and\\nthe natives, and received so many letters that Richard, who sat by\\nher, saw four envelopes in the gravy at once. Some of the letters\\nwere proceedings of ladies\\' committees or resolutions of ladies\\'\\nmeetings, which she read to us; others were applications from people\\nexcited in various ways about the cultivation of coffee, and natives;\\nothers required answers, and these she sent her eldest daughter from\\nthe table three or four times to write. She was full of business and\\nundoubtedly was, as she had told us, devoted to the cause.\\n\\nI was a little curious to know who a mild bald gentleman in\\nspectacles was, who dropped into a vacant chair (there was no top or\\nbottom in particular) after the fish was taken away and seemed\\npassively to submit himself to Borrioboola-Gha but not to be actively\\ninterested in that settlement. As he never spoke a word, he might\\nhave been a native but for his complexion. It was not until we left\\nthe table and he remained alone with Richard that the possibility of\\nhis being Mr. Jellyby ever entered my head. But he WAS Mr. Jellyby;\\nand a loquacious young man called Mr. Quale, with large shining knobs\\nfor temples and his hair all brushed to the back of his head, who\\ncame in the evening, and told Ada he was a philanthropist, also\\ninformed her that he called the matrimonial alliance of Mrs. Jellyby\\nwith Mr. Jellyby the union of mind and matter.\\n\\nThis young man, besides having a great deal to say for himself about\\nAfrica and a project of his for teaching the coffee colonists to\\nteach the natives to turn piano-forte legs and establish an export\\ntrade, delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby out by saying, \"I believe\\nnow, Mrs. Jellyby, you have received as many as from one hundred and\\nfifty to two hundred letters respecting Africa in a single day, have\\nyou not?\" or, \"If my memory does not deceive me, Mrs. Jellyby, you\\nonce mentioned that you had sent off five thousand circulars from one\\npost-office at one time?\"--always repeating Mrs. Jellyby\\'s answer to\\nus like an interpreter. During the whole evening, Mr. Jellyby sat in\\na corner with his head against the wall as if he were subject to low\\nspirits. It seemed that he had several times opened his mouth when\\nalone with Richard after dinner, as if he had something on his mind,\\nbut had always shut it again, to Richard\\'s extreme confusion, without\\nsaying anything.\\n\\nMrs. Jellyby, sitting in quite a nest of waste paper, drank coffee\\nall the evening and dictated at intervals to her eldest daughter. She\\nalso held a discussion with Mr. Quale, of which the subject seemed to\\nbe--if I understood it--the brotherhood of humanity, and gave\\nutterance to some beautiful sentiments. I was not so attentive an\\nauditor as I might have wished to be, however, for Peepy and the\\nother children came flocking about Ada and me in a corner of the\\ndrawing-room to ask for another story; so we sat down among them and\\ntold them in whispers \"Puss in Boots\" and I don\\'t know what else\\nuntil Mrs. Jellyby, accidentally remembering them, sent them to bed.\\nAs Peepy cried for me to take him to bed, I carried him upstairs,\\nwhere the young woman with the flannel bandage charged into the midst\\nof the little family like a dragon and overturned them into cribs.\\n\\nAfter that I occupied myself in making our room a little tidy and in\\ncoaxing a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn, which at\\nlast it did, quite brightly. On my return downstairs, I felt that\\nMrs. Jellyby looked down upon me rather for being so frivolous, and I\\nwas sorry for it, though at the same time I knew that I had no higher\\npretensions.\\n\\nIt was nearly midnight before we found an opportunity of going to\\nbed, and even then we left Mrs. Jellyby among her papers drinking\\ncoffee and Miss Jellyby biting the feather of her pen.\\n\\n\"What a strange house!\" said Ada when we got upstairs. \"How curious\\nof my cousin Jarndyce to send us here!\"\\n\\n\"My love,\" said I, \"it quite confuses me. I want to understand it,\\nand I can\\'t understand it at all.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" asked Ada with her pretty smile.\\n\\n\"All this, my dear,\" said I. \"It MUST be very good of Mrs. Jellyby to\\ntake such pains about a scheme for the benefit of natives--and\\nyet--Peepy and the housekeeping!\"\\n\\nAda laughed and put her arm about my neck as I stood looking at the\\nfire, and told me I was a quiet, dear, good creature and had won her\\nheart. \"You are so thoughtful, Esther,\" she said, \"and yet so\\ncheerful! And you do so much, so unpretendingly! You would make a\\nhome out of even this house.\"\\n\\nMy simple darling! She was quite unconscious that she only praised\\nherself and that it was in the goodness of her own heart that she\\nmade so much of me!\\n\\n\"May I ask you a question?\" said I when we had sat before the fire a\\nlittle while.\\n\\n\"Five hundred,\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"Your cousin, Mr. Jarndyce. I owe so much to him. Would you mind\\ndescribing him to me?\"\\n\\nShaking her golden hair, Ada turned her eyes upon me with such\\nlaughing wonder that I was full of wonder too, partly at her beauty,\\npartly at her surprise.\\n\\n\"Esther!\" she cried.\\n\\n\"My dear!\"\\n\\n\"You want a description of my cousin Jarndyce?\"\\n\\n\"My dear, I never saw him.\"\\n\\n\"And I never saw him!\" returned Ada.\\n\\nWell, to be sure!\\n\\nNo, she had never seen him. Young as she was when her mama died, she\\nremembered how the tears would come into her eyes when she spoke of\\nhim and of the noble generosity of his character, which she had said\\nwas to be trusted above all earthly things; and Ada trusted it. Her\\ncousin Jarndyce had written to her a few months ago--\"a plain, honest\\nletter,\" Ada said--proposing the arrangement we were now to enter on\\nand telling her that \"in time it might heal some of the wounds made\\nby the miserable Chancery suit.\" She had replied, gratefully\\naccepting his proposal. Richard had received a similar letter and had\\nmade a similar response. He HAD seen Mr. Jarndyce once, but only\\nonce, five years ago, at Winchester school. He had told Ada, when\\nthey were leaning on the screen before the fire where I found them,\\nthat he recollected him as \"a bluff, rosy fellow.\" This was the\\nutmost description Ada could give me.\\n\\nIt set me thinking so that when Ada was asleep, I still remained\\nbefore the fire, wondering and wondering about Bleak House, and\\nwondering and wondering that yesterday morning should seem so long\\nago. I don\\'t know where my thoughts had wandered when they were\\nrecalled by a tap at the door.\\n\\nI opened it softly and found Miss Jellyby shivering there with a\\nbroken candle in a broken candlestick in one hand and an egg-cup in\\nthe other.\\n\\n\"Good night!\" she said very sulkily.\\n\\n\"Good night!\" said I.\\n\\n\"May I come in?\" she shortly and unexpectedly asked me in the same\\nsulky way.\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said I. \"Don\\'t wake Miss Clare.\"\\n\\nShe would not sit down, but stood by the fire dipping her inky middle\\nfinger in the egg-cup, which contained vinegar, and smearing it over\\nthe ink stains on her face, frowning the whole time and looking very\\ngloomy.\\n\\n\"I wish Africa was dead!\" she said on a sudden.\\n\\nI was going to remonstrate.\\n\\n\"I do!\" she said \"Don\\'t talk to me, Miss Summerson. I hate it and\\ndetest it. It\\'s a beast!\"\\n\\nI told her she was tired, and I was sorry. I put my hand upon her\\nhead, and touched her forehead, and said it was hot now but would be\\ncool to-morrow. She still stood pouting and frowning at me, but\\npresently put down her egg-cup and turned softly towards the bed\\nwhere Ada lay.\\n\\n\"She is very pretty!\" she said with the same knitted brow and in the\\nsame uncivil manner.\\n\\nI assented with a smile.\\n\\n\"An orphan. Ain\\'t she?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"But knows a quantity, I suppose? Can dance, and play music, and\\nsing? She can talk French, I suppose, and do geography, and globes,\\nand needlework, and everything?\"\\n\\n\"No doubt,\" said I.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t,\" she returned. \"I can\\'t do anything hardly, except write.\\nI\\'m always writing for Ma. I wonder you two were not ashamed of\\nyourselves to come in this afternoon and see me able to do nothing\\nelse. It was like your ill nature. Yet you think yourselves very\\nfine, I dare say!\"\\n\\nI could see that the poor girl was near crying, and I resumed my\\nchair without speaking and looked at her (I hope) as mildly as I felt\\ntowards her.\\n\\n\"It\\'s disgraceful,\" she said. \"You know it is. The whole house is\\ndisgraceful. The children are disgraceful. I\\'M disgraceful. Pa\\'s\\nmiserable, and no wonder! Priscilla drinks--she\\'s always drinking.\\nIt\\'s a great shame and a great story of you if you say you didn\\'t\\nsmell her to-day. It was as bad as a public-house, waiting at dinner;\\nyou know it was!\"\\n\\n\"My dear, I don\\'t know it,\" said I.\\n\\n\"You do,\" she said very shortly. \"You shan\\'t say you don\\'t. You do!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear!\" said I. \"If you won\\'t let me speak--\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re speaking now. You know you are. Don\\'t tell stories, Miss\\nSummerson.\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" said I, \"as long as you won\\'t hear me out--\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to hear you out.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I think you do,\" said I, \"because that would be so very\\nunreasonable. I did not know what you tell me because the servant did\\nnot come near me at dinner; but I don\\'t doubt what you tell me, and I\\nam sorry to hear it.\"\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t make a merit of that,\" said she.\\n\\n\"No, my dear,\" said I. \"That would be very foolish.\"\\n\\nShe was still standing by the bed, and now stooped down (but still\\nwith the same discontented face) and kissed Ada. That done, she came\\nsoftly back and stood by the side of my chair. Her bosom was heaving\\nin a distressful manner that I greatly pitied, but I thought it\\nbetter not to speak.\\n\\n\"I wish I was dead!\" she broke out. \"I wish we were all dead. It\\nwould be a great deal better for us.\"\\n\\nIn a moment afterwards, she knelt on the ground at my side, hid her\\nface in my dress, passionately begged my pardon, and wept. I\\ncomforted her and would have raised her, but she cried no, no; she\\nwanted to stay there!\\n\\n\"You used to teach girls,\" she said, \"If you could only have taught\\nme, I could have learnt from you! I am so very miserable, and I like\\nyou so much!\"\\n\\nI could not persuade her to sit by me or to do anything but move a\\nragged stool to where she was kneeling, and take that, and still hold\\nmy dress in the same manner. By degrees the poor tired girl fell\\nasleep, and then I contrived to raise her head so that it should rest\\non my lap, and to cover us both with shawls. The fire went out, and\\nall night long she slumbered thus before the ashy grate. At first I\\nwas painfully awake and vainly tried to lose myself, with my eyes\\nclosed, among the scenes of the day. At length, by slow degrees, they\\nbecame indistinct and mingled. I began to lose the identity of the\\nsleeper resting on me. Now it was Ada, now one of my old Reading\\nfriends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted. Now\\nit was the little mad woman worn out with curtsying and smiling, now\\nsome one in authority at Bleak House. Lastly, it was no one, and I\\nwas no one.\\n\\nThe purblind day was feebly struggling with the fog when I opened my\\neyes to encounter those of a dirty-faced little spectre fixed upon\\nme. Peepy had scaled his crib, and crept down in his bed-gown and\\ncap, and was so cold that his teeth were chattering as if he had cut\\nthem all.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'model_output': '\\n\\nEsther Summerson leaves her childhood home to become a ward at Bleak House, where she is exposed to the sluggish world of the Court of Chancery and its endless Jarndyce v Jarndyce case. She bonds with fellow wards Richard and Ada, and encounters a variety of eccentric figures whose lives have been ruined by Chancery. Esther observes the crowded streets of London, where impoverished children live in squalor while their mothers pursue misguided philanthropy. Her coming-of-age story provides a lens to critique social issues related to law, class, poverty and gender roles. The lives of other characters also reveal hardship, broken families, lack of resources and human connection. Yet there is still hope in the empathy and resilience of some as they cope with their bleak circumstances. Overall, the narrative explores the bleak realities of injustice and human suffering, while retaining optimism through the growth and perseverance of the characters.'}]\n"

      "[{'summary': 'Tulkinghorn and Krook find Nemo dead, apparently from an overdose of opium. Krook claims no knowledge of Mr. Nemo\\'s identity or habits, and is chagrined because Nemo owes him six weeks\\' rent. Dr. Woodcourt (though he is not named immediately) arrives on the scene and reveals that Nemo has bought opium from him for a year and a half. Tulkinghorn learns from the ragamuffin Jo, a crossing-sweeper, that Nemo was a kind man, and gave Jo money when he had it. \"He wos wery good to me, he wos!\"\\n\\nAn inquest is held regarding Nemo\\'s death, a silly proceeding in a tavern complete with a comic vocalist, and he is officially found dead by accident. Since Nemo had no money or family, he is buried in a pauper\\'s grave.\\n\\nIn Chapter 12, the scene returns to Chesney Wold. The Dedlocks have returned, and have guests. Meanwhile Lady Dedlock continues to suffer ennui. Lady Dedlock meets the young maid Rosa for the first time, and takes a liking to her. This causes jealousy to arise in Lady Dedlock\\'s personal lady\\'s maid, Mademoiselle Hortense.\\n\\nTulkinghorn comes to Chesney Wold to inform Sir Leicester of the lawsuit brought upon him by his neighbor Boythorn. Tulkinghorn also has a message for Lady Dedlock concerning Nemo, whose handwriting was on the paper she had such interest in the last time he was at Chesney Wold, and tells of the law writer\\'s death. She pretends that the death doesn\\'t especially concern her; Tulkinghorn, unfooled, sees otherwise. The rest of the visit Lady Dedlock and Tulkinghorn watch each other carefully and surreptitiously.\\n\\nIn Chapter 13 Richard\\'s future is under futher discussion. His education has been soley the Classics (meaning, in those days, ancient Latin and Greek literature). Richard knows nothing about what he would like to do, except that he doesn\\'t want to become a minister in the Church of England. Mr. Jarndyce suggest the medical profession, and Richard quickly (too quickly) seizes upon the idea.\\n\\nMr. Boythorn -- along with Mr. Kenge, who is also present -- is enthusiastic about Richard\\'s proposed medical career and propounds the maltreatment of doctors aboard Navy ships. The men discuss how Richard is to be gotten into the profession, and Mr. Kenge plans for his cousin, Dr. Bayham Badger, to take Richard as an apprentice.\\n\\nAs Mr. Badger lives in London, the party goes to London a few weeks later to get Richard settled. In London, Esther attends the theatre and is followed and stared at by the lovestruck Mr. Guppy. Ada and Richard\\'s romance continues to blossom.\\n\\nAt Mr. Badger\\'s house the party meets Dr. Allan Woodcourt, and Esther finds him attractive. The talk at the Badgers\\' is of an unconventional kind -- namely the wealth and prestige of Mrs. Badgers two deceased husbands. Esther tells Mr. Jarndyce that Ada and Richard are in love, but he advises the lovers that because they are too young, and because Richard is not yet established, they should wait to be married. ', 'text': 'A touch on the lawyer\\'s wrinkled hand as he stands in the dark room,\\nirresolute, makes him start and say, \"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s me,\" returns the old man of the house, whose breath is in his\\near. \"Can\\'t you wake him?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"What have you done with your candle?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s gone out. Here it is.\"\\n\\nKrook takes it, goes to the fire, stoops over the red embers, and\\ntries to get a light. The dying ashes have no light to spare, and his\\nendeavours are vain. Muttering, after an ineffectual call to his\\nlodger, that he will go downstairs and bring a lighted candle from\\nthe shop, the old man departs. Mr. Tulkinghorn, for some new reason\\nthat he has, does not await his return in the room, but on the stairs\\noutside.\\n\\nThe welcome light soon shines upon the wall, as Krook comes slowly up\\nwith his green-eyed cat following at his heels. \"Does the man\\ngenerally sleep like this?\" inquired the lawyer in a low voice. \"Hi!\\nI don\\'t know,\" says Krook, shaking his head and lifting his eyebrows.\\n\"I know next to nothing of his habits except that he keeps himself\\nvery close.\"\\n\\nThus whispering, they both go in together. As the light goes in, the\\ngreat eyes in the shutters, darkening, seem to close. Not so the eyes\\nupon the bed.\\n\\n\"God save us!\" exclaims Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"He is dead!\" Krook drops\\nthe heavy hand he has taken up so suddenly that the arm swings over\\nthe bedside.\\n\\nThey look at one another for a moment.\\n\\n\"Send for some doctor! Call for Miss Flite up the stairs, sir. Here\\'s\\npoison by the bed! Call out for Flite, will you?\" says Krook, with\\nhis lean hands spread out above the body like a vampire\\'s wings.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn hurries to the landing and calls, \"Miss Flite! Flite!\\nMake haste, here, whoever you are! Flite!\" Krook follows him with his\\neyes, and while he is calling, finds opportunity to steal to the old\\nportmanteau and steal back again.\\n\\n\"Run, Flite, run! The nearest doctor! Run!\" So Mr. Krook addresses a\\ncrazy little woman who is his female lodger, who appears and vanishes\\nin a breath, who soon returns accompanied by a testy medical man\\nbrought from his dinner, with a broad, snuffy upper lip and a broad\\nScotch tongue.\\n\\n\"Ey! Bless the hearts o\\' ye,\" says the medical man, looking up at\\nthem after a moment\\'s examination. \"He\\'s just as dead as Phairy!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn (standing by the old portmanteau) inquires if he has\\nbeen dead any time.\\n\\n\"Any time, sir?\" says the medical gentleman. \"It\\'s probable he wull\\nhave been dead aboot three hours.\"\\n\\n\"About that time, I should say,\" observes a dark young man on the\\nother side of the bed.\\n\\n\"Air you in the maydickle prayfession yourself, sir?\" inquires the\\nfirst.\\n\\nThe dark young man says yes.\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll just tak\\' my depairture,\" replies the other, \"for I\\'m nae\\ngude here!\" With which remark he finishes his brief attendance and\\nreturns to finish his dinner.\\n\\nThe dark young surgeon passes the candle across and across the face\\nand carefully examines the law-writer, who has established his\\npretensions to his name by becoming indeed No one.\\n\\n\"I knew this person by sight very well,\" says he. \"He has purchased\\nopium of me for the last year and a half. Was anybody present related\\nto him?\" glancing round upon the three bystanders.\\n\\n\"I was his landlord,\" grimly answers Krook, taking the candle from\\nthe surgeon\\'s outstretched hand. \"He told me once I was the nearest\\nrelation he had.\"\\n\\n\"He has died,\" says the surgeon, \"of an over-dose of opium, there is\\nno doubt. The room is strongly flavoured with it. There is enough\\nhere now,\" taking an old tea-pot from Mr. Krook, \"to kill a dozen\\npeople.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think he did it on purpose?\" asks Krook.\\n\\n\"Took the over-dose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes!\" Krook almost smacks his lips with the unction of a horrible\\ninterest.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t say. I should think it unlikely, as he has been in the habit\\nof taking so much. But nobody can tell. He was very poor, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"I suppose he was. His room--don\\'t look rich,\" says Krook, who might\\nhave changed eyes with his cat, as he casts his sharp glance around.\\n\"But I have never been in it since he had it, and he was too close to\\nname his circumstances to me.\"\\n\\n\"Did he owe you any rent?\"\\n\\n\"Six weeks.\"\\n\\n\"He will never pay it!\" says the young man, resuming his examination.\\n\"It is beyond a doubt that he is indeed as dead as Pharaoh; and to\\njudge from his appearance and condition, I should think it a happy\\nrelease. Yet he must have been a good figure when a youth, and I dare\\nsay, good-looking.\" He says this, not unfeelingly, while sitting on\\nthe bedstead\\'s edge with his face towards that other face and his\\nhand upon the region of the heart. \"I recollect once thinking there\\nwas something in his manner, uncouth as it was, that denoted a fall\\nin life. Was that so?\" he continues, looking round.\\n\\nKrook replies, \"You might as well ask me to describe the ladies whose\\nheads of hair I have got in sacks downstairs. Than that he was my\\nlodger for a year and a half and lived--or didn\\'t live--by\\nlaw-writing, I know no more of him.\"\\n\\nDuring this dialogue Mr. Tulkinghorn has stood aloof by the old\\nportmanteau, with his hands behind him, equally removed, to all\\nappearance, from all three kinds of interest exhibited near the\\nbed--from the young surgeon\\'s professional interest in death,\\nnoticeable as being quite apart from his remarks on the deceased as\\nan individual; from the old man\\'s unction; and the little crazy\\nwoman\\'s awe. His imperturbable face has been as inexpressive as his\\nrusty clothes. One could not even say he has been thinking all this\\nwhile. He has shown neither patience nor impatience, nor attention\\nnor abstraction. He has shown nothing but his shell. As easily might\\nthe tone of a delicate musical instrument be inferred from its case,\\nas the tone of Mr. Tulkinghorn from his case.\\n\\nHe now interposes, addressing the young surgeon in his unmoved,\\nprofessional way.\\n\\n\"I looked in here,\" he observes, \"just before you, with the\\nintention of giving this deceased man, whom I never saw alive, some\\nemployment at his trade of copying. I had heard of him from my\\nstationer--Snagsby of Cook\\'s Court. Since no one here knows anything\\nabout him, it might be as well to send for Snagsby. Ah!\" to the\\nlittle crazy woman, who has often seen him in court, and whom he has\\noften seen, and who proposes, in frightened dumb-show, to go for the\\nlaw-stationer. \"Suppose you do!\"\\n\\nWhile she is gone, the surgeon abandons his hopeless investigation\\nand covers its subject with the patchwork counterpane. Mr. Krook and\\nhe interchange a word or two. Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing, but\\nstands, ever, near the old portmanteau.\\n\\nMr. Snagsby arrives hastily in his grey coat and his black sleeves.\\n\"Dear me, dear me,\" he says; \"and it has come to this, has it! Bless\\nmy soul!\"\\n\\n\"Can you give the person of the house any information about this\\nunfortunate creature, Snagsby?\" inquires Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"He was in\\narrears with his rent, it seems. And he must be buried, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby, coughing his apologetic cough behind\\nhis hand, \"I really don\\'t know what advice I could offer, except\\nsending for the beadle.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t speak of advice,\" returns Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"I could\\nadvise--\"\\n\\n\"No one better, sir, I am sure,\" says Mr. Snagsby, with his\\ndeferential cough.\\n\\n\"I speak of affording some clue to his connexions, or to where he\\ncame from, or to anything concerning him.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby after prefacing his reply with\\nhis cough of general propitiation, \"that I no more know where he came\\nfrom than I know--\"\\n\\n\"Where he has gone to, perhaps,\" suggests the surgeon to help him\\nout.\\n\\nA pause. Mr. Tulkinghorn looking at the law-stationer. Mr. Krook,\\nwith his mouth open, looking for somebody to speak next.\\n\\n\"As to his connexions, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby, \"if a person was to\\nsay to me, \\'Snagsby, here\\'s twenty thousand pound down, ready for you\\nin the Bank of England if you\\'ll only name one of \\'em,\\' I couldn\\'t do\\nit, sir! About a year and a half ago--to the best of my belief, at\\nthe time when he first came to lodge at the present rag and bottle\\nshop--\"\\n\\n\"That was the time!\" says Krook with a nod.\\n\\n\"About a year and a half ago,\" says Mr. Snagsby, strengthened, \"he\\ncame into our place one morning after breakfast, and finding my\\nlittle woman (which I name Mrs. Snagsby when I use that appellation)\\nin our shop, produced a specimen of his handwriting and gave her to\\nunderstand that he was in want of copying work to do and was, not to\\nput too fine a point upon it,\" a favourite apology for plain speaking\\nwith Mr. Snagsby, which he always offers with a sort of argumentative\\nfrankness, \"hard up! My little woman is not in general partial to\\nstrangers, particular--not to put too fine a point upon it--when they\\nwant anything. But she was rather took by something about this\\nperson, whether by his being unshaved, or by his hair being in want\\nof attention, or by what other ladies\\' reasons, I leave you to judge;\\nand she accepted of the specimen, and likewise of the address. My\\nlittle woman hasn\\'t a good ear for names,\" proceeds Mr. Snagsby after\\nconsulting his cough of consideration behind his hand, \"and she\\nconsidered Nemo equally the same as Nimrod. In consequence of which,\\nshe got into a habit of saying to me at meals, \\'Mr. Snagsby, you\\nhaven\\'t found Nimrod any work yet!\\' or \\'Mr. Snagsby, why didn\\'t you\\ngive that eight and thirty Chancery folio in Jarndyce to Nimrod?\\' or\\nsuch like. And that is the way he gradually fell into job-work at our\\nplace; and that is the most I know of him except that he was a quick\\nhand, and a hand not sparing of night-work, and that if you gave him\\nout, say, five and forty folio on the Wednesday night, you would have\\nit brought in on the Thursday morning. All of which--\" Mr. Snagsby\\nconcludes by politely motioning with his hat towards the bed, as much\\nas to add, \"I have no doubt my honourable friend would confirm if he\\nwere in a condition to do it.\"\\n\\n\"Hadn\\'t you better see,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn to Krook, \"whether he\\nhad any papers that may enlighten you? There will be an inquest, and\\nyou will be asked the question. You can read?\"\\n\\n\"No, I can\\'t,\" returns the old man with a sudden grin.\\n\\n\"Snagsby,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, \"look over the room for him. He will\\nget into some trouble or difficulty otherwise. Being here, I\\'ll wait\\nif you make haste, and then I can testify on his behalf, if it should\\never be necessary, that all was fair and right. If you will hold the\\ncandle for Mr. Snagsby, my friend, he\\'ll soon see whether there is\\nanything to help you.\"\\n\\n\"In the first place, here\\'s an old portmanteau, sir,\" says Snagsby.\\n\\nAh, to be sure, so there is! Mr. Tulkinghorn does not appear to have\\nseen it before, though he is standing so close to it, and though\\nthere is very little else, heaven knows.\\n\\nThe marine-store merchant holds the light, and the law-stationer\\nconducts the search. The surgeon leans against the corner of the\\nchimney-piece; Miss Flite peeps and trembles just within the door.\\nThe apt old scholar of the old school, with his dull black breeches\\ntied with ribbons at the knees, his large black waistcoat, his\\nlong-sleeved black coat, and his wisp of limp white neckerchief tied\\nin the bow the peerage knows so well, stands in exactly the same\\nplace and attitude.\\n\\nThere are some worthless articles of clothing in the old portmanteau;\\nthere is a bundle of pawnbrokers\\' duplicates, those turnpike tickets\\non the road of poverty; there is a crumpled paper, smelling of opium,\\non which are scrawled rough memoranda--as, took, such a day, so many\\ngrains; took, such another day, so many more--begun some time ago, as\\nif with the intention of being regularly continued, but soon left\\noff. There are a few dirty scraps of newspapers, all referring to\\ncoroners\\' inquests; there is nothing else. They search the cupboard\\nand the drawer of the ink-splashed table. There is not a morsel of an\\nold letter or of any other writing in either. The young surgeon\\nexamines the dress on the law-writer. A knife and some odd halfpence\\nare all he finds. Mr. Snagsby\\'s suggestion is the practical\\nsuggestion after all, and the beadle must be called in.\\n\\nSo the little crazy lodger goes for the beadle, and the rest come out\\nof the room. \"Don\\'t leave the cat there!\" says the surgeon; \"that\\nwon\\'t do!\" Mr. Krook therefore drives her out before him, and she\\ngoes furtively downstairs, winding her lithe tail and licking her\\nlips.\\n\\n\"Good night!\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, and goes home to Allegory and\\nmeditation.\\n\\nBy this time the news has got into the court. Groups of its\\ninhabitants assemble to discuss the thing, and the outposts of the\\narmy of observation (principally boys) are pushed forward to Mr.\\nKrook\\'s window, which they closely invest. A policeman has already\\nwalked up to the room, and walked down again to the door, where he\\nstands like a tower, only condescending to see the boys at his base\\noccasionally; but whenever he does see them, they quail and fall\\nback. Mrs. Perkins, who has not been for some weeks on speaking terms\\nwith Mrs. Piper in consequence for an unpleasantness originating in\\nyoung Perkins\\' having \"fetched\" young Piper \"a crack,\" renews her\\nfriendly intercourse on this auspicious occasion. The potboy at the\\ncorner, who is a privileged amateur, as possessing official knowledge\\nof life and having to deal with drunken men occasionally, exchanges\\nconfidential communications with the policeman and has the appearance\\nof an impregnable youth, unassailable by truncheons and unconfinable\\nin station-houses. People talk across the court out of window, and\\nbare-headed scouts come hurrying in from Chancery Lane to know what\\'s\\nthe matter. The general feeling seems to be that it\\'s a blessing Mr.\\nKrook warn\\'t made away with first, mingled with a little natural\\ndisappointment that he was not. In the midst of this sensation, the\\nbeadle arrives.\\n\\nThe beadle, though generally understood in the neighbourhood to be a\\nridiculous institution, is not without a certain popularity for the\\nmoment, if it were only as a man who is going to see the body. The\\npoliceman considers him an imbecile civilian, a remnant of the\\nbarbarous watchmen times, but gives him admission as something that\\nmust be borne with until government shall abolish him. The sensation\\nis heightened as the tidings spread from mouth to mouth that the\\nbeadle is on the ground and has gone in.\\n\\nBy and by the beadle comes out, once more intensifying the sensation,\\nwhich has rather languished in the interval. He is understood to be\\nin want of witnesses for the inquest to-morrow who can tell the\\ncoroner and jury anything whatever respecting the deceased. Is\\nimmediately referred to innumerable people who can tell nothing\\nwhatever. Is made more imbecile by being constantly informed that\\nMrs. Green\\'s son \"was a law-writer his-self and knowed him better\\nthan anybody,\" which son of Mrs. Green\\'s appears, on inquiry, to be\\nat the present time aboard a vessel bound for China, three months\\nout, but considered accessible by telegraph on application to the\\nLords of the Admiralty. Beadle goes into various shops and parlours,\\nexamining the inhabitants, always shutting the door first, and by\\nexclusion, delay, and general idiotcy exasperating the public.\\nPoliceman seen to smile to potboy. Public loses interest and\\nundergoes reaction. Taunts the beadle in shrill youthful voices with\\nhaving boiled a boy, choruses fragments of a popular song to that\\neffect and importing that the boy was made into soup for the\\nworkhouse. Policeman at last finds it necessary to support the law\\nand seize a vocalist, who is released upon the flight of the rest on\\ncondition of his getting out of this then, come, and cutting it--a\\ncondition he immediately observes. So the sensation dies off for the\\ntime; and the unmoved policeman (to whom a little opium, more or\\nless, is nothing), with his shining hat, stiff stock, inflexible\\ngreat-coat, stout belt and bracelet, and all things fitting, pursues\\nhis lounging way with a heavy tread, beating the palms of his white\\ngloves one against the other and stopping now and then at a\\nstreet-corner to look casually about for anything between a lost\\nchild and a murder.\\n\\nUnder cover of the night, the feeble-minded beadle comes flitting\\nabout Chancery Lane with his summonses, in which every juror\\'s name\\nis wrongly spelt, and nothing rightly spelt but the beadle\\'s own\\nname, which nobody can read or wants to know. The summonses served\\nand his witnesses forewarned, the beadle goes to Mr. Krook\\'s to keep\\na small appointment he has made with certain paupers, who, presently\\narriving, are conducted upstairs, where they leave the great eyes in\\nthe shutter something new to stare at, in that last shape which\\nearthly lodgings take for No one--and for Every one.\\n\\nAnd all that night the coffin stands ready by the old portmanteau;\\nand the lonely figure on the bed, whose path in life has lain through\\nfive and forty years, lies there with no more track behind him that\\nany one can trace than a deserted infant.\\n\\nNext day the court is all alive--is like a fair, as Mrs. Perkins,\\nmore than reconciled to Mrs. Piper, says in amicable conversation\\nwith that excellent woman. The coroner is to sit in the first-floor\\nroom at the Sol\\'s Arms, where the Harmonic Meetings take place twice\\na week and where the chair is filled by a gentleman of professional\\ncelebrity, faced by Little Swills, the comic vocalist, who hopes\\n(according to the bill in the window) that his friends will rally\\nround him and support first-rate talent. The Sol\\'s Arms does a brisk\\nstroke of business all the morning. Even children so require\\nsustaining under the general excitement that a pieman who has\\nestablished himself for the occasion at the corner of the court says\\nhis brandy-balls go off like smoke. What time the beadle, hovering\\nbetween the door of Mr. Krook\\'s establishment and the door of the\\nSol\\'s Arms, shows the curiosity in his keeping to a few discreet\\nspirits and accepts the compliment of a glass of ale or so in return.\\n\\nAt the appointed hour arrives the coroner, for whom the jurymen are\\nwaiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good\\ndry skittle-ground attached to the Sol\\'s Arms. The coroner frequents\\nmore public-houses than any man alive. The smell of sawdust, beer,\\ntobacco-smoke, and spirits is inseparable in his vocation from death\\nin its most awful shapes. He is conducted by the beadle and the\\nlandlord to the Harmonic Meeting Room, where he puts his hat on the\\npiano and takes a Windsor-chair at the head of a long table formed of\\nseveral short tables put together and ornamented with glutinous rings\\nin endless involutions, made by pots and glasses. As many of the jury\\nas can crowd together at the table sit there. The rest get among the\\nspittoons and pipes or lean against the piano. Over the coroner\\'s\\nhead is a small iron garland, the pendant handle of a bell, which\\nrather gives the majesty of the court the appearance of going to be\\nhanged presently.\\n\\nCall over and swear the jury! While the ceremony is in progress,\\nsensation is created by the entrance of a chubby little man in a\\nlarge shirt-collar, with a moist eye and an inflamed nose, who\\nmodestly takes a position near the door as one of the general public,\\nbut seems familiar with the room too. A whisper circulates that this\\nis Little Swills. It is considered not unlikely that he will get up\\nan imitation of the coroner and make it the principal feature of the\\nHarmonic Meeting in the evening.\\n\\n\"Well, gentlemen--\" the coroner begins.\\n\\n\"Silence there, will you!\" says the beadle. Not to the coroner,\\nthough it might appear so.\\n\\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" resumes the coroner. \"You are impanelled here to\\ninquire into the death of a certain man. Evidence will be given\\nbefore you as to the circumstances attending that death, and you will\\ngive your verdict according to the--skittles; they must be stopped,\\nyou know, beadle!--evidence, and not according to anything else. The\\nfirst thing to be done is to view the body.\"\\n\\n\"Make way there!\" cries the beadle.\\n\\nSo they go out in a loose procession, something after the manner of a\\nstraggling funeral, and make their inspection in Mr. Krook\\'s back\\nsecond floor, from which a few of the jurymen retire pale and\\nprecipitately. The beadle is very careful that two gentlemen not very\\nneat about the cuffs and buttons (for whose accommodation he has\\nprovided a special little table near the coroner in the Harmonic\\nMeeting Room) should see all that is to be seen. For they are the\\npublic chroniclers of such inquiries by the line; and he is not\\nsuperior to the universal human infirmity, but hopes to read in print\\nwhat \"Mooney, the active and intelligent beadle of the district,\"\\nsaid and did and even aspires to see the name of Mooney as familiarly\\nand patronizingly mentioned as the name of the hangman is, according\\nto the latest examples.\\n\\nLittle Swills is waiting for the coroner and jury on their return.\\nMr. Tulkinghorn, also. Mr. Tulkinghorn is received with distinction\\nand seated near the coroner between that high judicial officer, a\\nbagatelle-board, and the coal-box. The inquiry proceeds. The jury\\nlearn how the subject of their inquiry died, and learn no more about\\nhim. \"A very eminent solicitor is in attendance, gentlemen,\" says the\\ncoroner, \"who, I am informed, was accidentally present when discovery\\nof the death was made, but he could only repeat the evidence you have\\nalready heard from the surgeon, the landlord, the lodger, and the\\nlaw-stationer, and it is not necessary to trouble him. Is anybody in\\nattendance who knows anything more?\"\\n\\nMrs. Piper pushed forward by Mrs. Perkins. Mrs. Piper sworn.\\n\\nAnastasia Piper, gentlemen. Married woman. Now, Mrs. Piper, what have\\nyou got to say about this?\\n\\nWhy, Mrs. Piper has a good deal to say, chiefly in parentheses and\\nwithout punctuation, but not much to tell. Mrs. Piper lives in the\\ncourt (which her husband is a cabinet-maker), and it has long been\\nwell beknown among the neighbours (counting from the day next but one\\nbefore the half-baptizing of Alexander James Piper aged eighteen\\nmonths and four days old on accounts of not being expected to live\\nsuch was the sufferings gentlemen of that child in his gums) as the\\nplaintive--so Mrs. Piper insists on calling the deceased--was\\nreported to have sold himself. Thinks it was the plaintive\\'s air in\\nwhich that report originatinin. See the plaintive often and\\nconsidered as his air was feariocious and not to be allowed to go\\nabout some children being timid (and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins\\nmay be brought forard for she is here and will do credit to her\\nhusband and herself and family). Has seen the plaintive wexed and\\nworrited by the children (for children they will ever be and you\\ncannot expect them specially if of playful dispositions to be\\nMethoozellers which you was not yourself). On accounts of this and\\nhis dark looks has often dreamed as she see him take a pick-axe from\\nhis pocket and split Johnny\\'s head (which the child knows not fear\\nand has repeatually called after him close at his eels). Never\\nhowever see the plaintive take a pick-axe or any other wepping far\\nfrom it. Has seen him hurry away when run and called after as if not\\npartial to children and never see him speak to neither child nor\\ngrown person at any time (excepting the boy that sweeps the crossing\\ndown the lane over the way round the corner which if he was here\\nwould tell you that he has been seen a-speaking to him frequent).\\n\\nSays the coroner, is that boy here? Says the beadle, no, sir, he is\\nnot here. Says the coroner, go and fetch him then. In the absence of\\nthe active and intelligent, the coroner converses with Mr.\\nTulkinghorn.\\n\\nOh! Here\\'s the boy, gentlemen!\\n\\nHere he is, very muddy, very hoarse, very ragged. Now, boy! But stop\\na minute. Caution. This boy must be put through a few preliminary\\npaces.\\n\\nName, Jo. Nothing else that he knows on. Don\\'t know that everybody\\nhas two names. Never heerd of sich a think. Don\\'t know that Jo is\\nshort for a longer name. Thinks it long enough for HIM. HE don\\'t find\\nno fault with it. Spell it? No. HE can\\'t spell it. No father, no\\nmother, no friends. Never been to school. What\\'s home? Knows a\\nbroom\\'s a broom, and knows it\\'s wicked to tell a lie. Don\\'t recollect\\nwho told him about the broom or about the lie, but knows both. Can\\'t\\nexactly say what\\'ll be done to him arter he\\'s dead if he tells a lie\\nto the gentlemen here, but believes it\\'ll be something wery bad to\\npunish him, and serve him right--and so he\\'ll tell the truth.\\n\\n\"This won\\'t do, gentlemen!\" says the coroner with a melancholy shake\\nof the head.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you think you can receive his evidence, sir?\" asks an\\nattentive juryman.\\n\\n\"Out of the question,\" says the coroner. \"You have heard the boy.\\n\\'Can\\'t exactly say\\' won\\'t do, you know. We can\\'t take THAT in a court\\nof justice, gentlemen. It\\'s terrible depravity. Put the boy aside.\"\\n\\nBoy put aside, to the great edification of the audience, especially\\nof Little Swills, the comic vocalist.\\n\\nNow. Is there any other witness? No other witness.\\n\\nVery well, gentlemen! Here\\'s a man unknown, proved to have been in\\nthe habit of taking opium in large quantities for a year and a half,\\nfound dead of too much opium. If you think you have any evidence to\\nlead you to the conclusion that he committed suicide, you will come\\nto that conclusion. If you think it is a case of accidental death,\\nyou will find a verdict accordingly.\\n\\nVerdict accordingly. Accidental death. No doubt. Gentlemen, you are\\ndischarged. Good afternoon.\\n\\nWhile the coroner buttons his great-coat, Mr. Tulkinghorn and he give\\nprivate audience to the rejected witness in a corner.\\n\\nThat graceless creature only knows that the dead man (whom he\\nrecognized just now by his yellow face and black hair) was sometimes\\nhooted and pursued about the streets. That one cold winter night when\\nhe, the boy, was shivering in a doorway near his crossing, the man\\nturned to look at him, and came back, and having questioned him and\\nfound that he had not a friend in the world, said, \"Neither have I.\\nNot one!\" and gave him the price of a supper and a night\\'s lodging.\\nThat the man had often spoken to him since and asked him whether he\\nslept sound at night, and how he bore cold and hunger, and whether he\\never wished to die, and similar strange questions. That when the man\\nhad no money, he would say in passing, \"I am as poor as you to-day,\\nJo,\" but that when he had any, he had always (as the boy most\\nheartily believes) been glad to give him some.\\n\\n\"He was wery good to me,\" says the boy, wiping his eyes with his\\nwretched sleeve. \"Wen I see him a-layin\\' so stritched out just now, I\\nwished he could have heerd me tell him so. He wos wery good to me, he\\nwos!\"\\n\\nAs he shuffles downstairs, Mr. Snagsby, lying in wait for him, puts a\\nhalf-crown in his hand. \"If you ever see me coming past your crossing\\nwith my little woman--I mean a lady--\" says Mr. Snagsby with his\\nfinger on his nose, \"don\\'t allude to it!\"\\n\\nFor some little time the jurymen hang about the Sol\\'s Arms\\ncolloquially. In the sequel, half-a-dozen are caught up in a cloud of\\npipe-smoke that pervades the parlour of the Sol\\'s Arms; two stroll to\\nHampstead; and four engage to go half-price to the play at night, and\\ntop up with oysters. Little Swills is treated on several hands. Being\\nasked what he thinks of the proceedings, characterizes them (his\\nstrength lying in a slangular direction) as \"a rummy start.\" The\\nlandlord of the Sol\\'s Arms, finding Little Swills so popular,\\ncommends him highly to the jurymen and public, observing that for a\\nsong in character he don\\'t know his equal and that that man\\'s\\ncharacter-wardrobe would fill a cart.\\n\\nThus, gradually the Sol\\'s Arms melts into the shadowy night and then\\nflares out of it strong in gas. The Harmonic Meeting hour arriving,\\nthe gentleman of professional celebrity takes the chair, is faced\\n(red-faced) by Little Swills; their friends rally round them and\\nsupport first-rate talent. In the zenith of the evening, Little\\nSwills says, \"Gentlemen, if you\\'ll permit me, I\\'ll attempt a short\\ndescription of a scene of real life that came off here to-day.\" Is\\nmuch applauded and encouraged; goes out of the room as Swills; comes\\nin as the coroner (not the least in the world like him); describes\\nthe inquest, with recreative intervals of piano-forte accompaniment,\\nto the refrain: With his (the coroner\\'s) tippy tol li doll, tippy tol\\nlo doll, tippy tol li doll, Dee!\\n\\nThe jingling piano at last is silent, and the Harmonic friends rally\\nround their pillows. Then there is rest around the lonely figure, now\\nlaid in its last earthly habitation; and it is watched by the gaunt\\neyes in the shutters through some quiet hours of night. If this\\nforlorn man could have been prophetically seen lying here by the\\nmother at whose breast he nestled, a little child, with eyes upraised\\nto her loving face, and soft hand scarcely knowing how to close upon\\nthe neck to which it crept, what an impossibility the vision would\\nhave seemed! Oh, if in brighter days the now-extinguished fire within\\nhim ever burned for one woman who held him in her heart, where is\\nshe, while these ashes are above the ground!\\n\\nIt is anything but a night of rest at Mr. Snagsby\\'s, in Cook\\'s Court,\\nwhere Guster murders sleep by going, as Mr. Snagsby himself\\nallows--not to put too fine a point upon it--out of one fit into\\ntwenty. The occasion of this seizure is that Guster has a tender\\nheart and a susceptible something that possibly might have been\\nimagination, but for Tooting and her patron saint. Be it what it may,\\nnow, it was so direfully impressed at tea-time by Mr. Snagsby\\'s\\naccount of the inquiry at which he had assisted that at supper-time\\nshe projected herself into the kitchen, preceded by a flying Dutch\\ncheese, and fell into a fit of unusual duration, which she only came\\nout of to go into another, and another, and so on through a chain of\\nfits, with short intervals between, of which she has pathetically\\navailed herself by consuming them in entreaties to Mrs. Snagsby not\\nto give her warning \"when she quite comes to,\" and also in appeals to\\nthe whole establishment to lay her down on the stones and go to bed.\\nHence, Mr. Snagsby, at last hearing the cock at the little dairy in\\nCursitor Street go into that disinterested ecstasy of his on the\\nsubject of daylight, says, drawing a long breath, though the most\\npatient of men, \"I thought you was dead, I am sure!\"\\n\\nWhat question this enthusiastic fowl supposes he settles when he\\nstrains himself to such an extent, or why he should thus crow (so men\\ncrow on various triumphant public occasions, however) about what\\ncannot be of any moment to him, is his affair. It is enough that\\ndaylight comes, morning comes, noon comes.\\n\\nThen the active and intelligent, who has got into the morning papers\\nas such, comes with his pauper company to Mr. Krook\\'s and bears off\\nthe body of our dear brother here departed to a hemmed-in churchyard,\\npestiferous and obscene, whence malignant diseases are communicated\\nto the bodies of our dear brothers and sisters who have not departed,\\nwhile our dear brothers and sisters who hang about official\\nback-stairs--would to heaven they HAD departed!--are very complacent\\nand agreeable. Into a beastly scrap of ground which a Turk would\\nreject as a savage abomination and a Caffre would shudder at, they\\nbring our dear brother here departed to receive Christian burial.\\n\\nWith houses looking on, on every side, save where a reeking little\\ntunnel of a court gives access to the iron gate--with every villainy\\nof life in action close on death, and every poisonous element of\\ndeath in action close on life--here they lower our dear brother down\\na foot or two, here sow him in corruption, to be raised in\\ncorruption: an avenging ghost at many a sick-bedside, a shameful\\ntestimony to future ages how civilization and barbarism walked this\\nboastful island together.\\n\\nCome night, come darkness, for you cannot come too soon or stay too\\nlong by such a place as this! Come, straggling lights into the\\nwindows of the ugly houses; and you who do iniquity therein, do it at\\nleast with this dread scene shut out! Come, flame of gas, burning so\\nsullenly above the iron gate, on which the poisoned air deposits its\\nwitch-ointment slimy to the touch! It is well that you should call to\\nevery passerby, \"Look here!\"\\n\\nWith the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel-court to\\nthe outside of the iron gate. It holds the gate with its hands and\\nlooks in between the bars, stands looking in for a little while.\\n\\nIt then, with an old broom it carries, softly sweeps the step and\\nmakes the archway clean. It does so very busily and trimly, looks in\\nagain a little while, and so departs.\\n\\nJo, is it thou? Well, well! Though a rejected witness, who \"can\\'t\\nexactly say\" what will be done to him in greater hands than men\\'s,\\nthou art not quite in outer darkness. There is something like a\\ndistant ray of light in thy muttered reason for this: \"He wos wery\\ngood to me, he wos!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt has left off raining down in Lincolnshire at last, and Chesney\\nWold has taken heart. Mrs. Rouncewell is full of hospitable cares,\\nfor Sir Leicester and my Lady are coming home from Paris. The\\nfashionable intelligence has found it out and communicates the glad\\ntidings to benighted England. It has also found out that they will\\nentertain a brilliant and distinguished circle of the ELITE of the\\nBEAU MONDE (the fashionable intelligence is weak in English, but a\\ngiant refreshed in French) at the ancient and hospitable family seat\\nin Lincolnshire.\\n\\nFor the greater honour of the brilliant and distinguished circle, and\\nof Chesney Wold into the bargain, the broken arch of the bridge in\\nthe park is mended; and the water, now retired within its proper\\nlimits and again spanned gracefully, makes a figure in the prospect\\nfrom the house. The clear, cold sunshine glances into the brittle\\nwoods and approvingly beholds the sharp wind scattering the leaves\\nand drying the moss. It glides over the park after the moving shadows\\nof the clouds, and chases them, and never catches them, all day. It\\nlooks in at the windows and touches the ancestral portraits with bars\\nand patches of brightness never contemplated by the painters. Athwart\\nthe picture of my Lady, over the great chimney-piece, it throws a\\nbroad bend-sinister of light that strikes down crookedly into the\\nhearth and seems to rend it.\\n\\nThrough the same cold sunshine and the same sharp wind, my Lady and\\nSir Leicester, in their travelling chariot (my Lady\\'s woman and Sir\\nLeicester\\'s man affectionate in the rumble), start for home. With a\\nconsiderable amount of jingling and whip-cracking, and many plunging\\ndemonstrations on the part of two bare-backed horses and two centaurs\\nwith glazed hats, jack-boots, and flowing manes and tails, they\\nrattle out of the yard of the Hotel Bristol in the Place Vendome and\\ncanter between the sun-and-shadow-chequered colonnade of the Rue de\\nRivoli and the garden of the ill-fated palace of a headless king and\\nqueen, off by the Place of Concord, and the Elysian Fields, and the\\nGate of the Star, out of Paris.\\n\\nSooth to say, they cannot go away too fast, for even here my Lady\\nDedlock has been bored to death. Concert, assembly, opera, theatre,\\ndrive, nothing is new to my Lady under the worn-out heavens. Only\\nlast Sunday, when poor wretches were gay--within the walls playing\\nwith children among the clipped trees and the statues in the Palace\\nGarden; walking, a score abreast, in the Elysian Fields, made more\\nElysian by performing dogs and wooden horses; between whiles\\nfiltering (a few) through the gloomy Cathedral of Our Lady to say a\\nword or two at the base of a pillar within flare of a rusty little\\ngridiron-full of gusty little tapers; without the walls encompassing\\nParis with dancing, love-making, wine-drinking, tobacco-smoking,\\ntomb-visiting, billiard card and domino playing, quack-doctoring, and\\nmuch murderous refuse, animate and inanimate--only last Sunday, my\\nLady, in the desolation of Boredom and the clutch of Giant Despair,\\nalmost hated her own maid for being in spirits.\\n\\nShe cannot, therefore, go too fast from Paris. Weariness of soul lies\\nbefore her, as it lies behind--her Ariel has put a girdle of it round\\nthe whole earth, and it cannot be unclasped--but the imperfect remedy\\nis always to fly from the last place where it has been experienced.\\nFling Paris back into the distance, then, exchanging it for endless\\navenues and cross-avenues of wintry trees! And, when next beheld, let\\nit be some leagues away, with the Gate of the Star a white speck\\nglittering in the sun, and the city a mere mound in a plain--two dark\\nsquare towers rising out of it, and light and shadow descending on it\\naslant, like the angels in Jacob\\'s dream!\\n\\nSir Leicester is generally in a complacent state, and rarely bored.\\nWhen he has nothing else to do, he can always contemplate his own\\ngreatness. It is a considerable advantage to a man to have so\\ninexhaustible a subject. After reading his letters, he leans back in\\nhis corner of the carriage and generally reviews his importance to\\nsociety.\\n\\n\"You have an unusual amount of correspondence this morning?\" says my\\nLady after a long time. She is fatigued with reading. Has almost read\\na page in twenty miles.\\n\\n\"Nothing in it, though. Nothing whatever.\"\\n\\n\"I saw one of Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s long effusions, I think?\"\\n\\n\"You see everything,\" says Sir Leicester with admiration.\\n\\n\"Ha!\" sighs my Lady. \"He is the most tiresome of men!\"\\n\\n\"He sends--I really beg your pardon--he sends,\" says Sir Leicester,\\nselecting the letter and unfolding it, \"a message to you. Our\\nstopping to change horses as I came to his postscript drove it out of\\nmy memory. I beg you\\'ll excuse me. He says--\" Sir Leicester is so\\nlong in taking out his eye-glass and adjusting it that my Lady looks\\na little irritated. \"He says \\'In the matter of the right of way--\\' I\\nbeg your pardon, that\\'s not the place. He says--yes! Here I have it!\\nHe says, \\'I beg my respectful compliments to my Lady, who, I hope,\\nhas benefited by the change. Will you do me the favour to mention (as\\nit may interest her) that I have something to tell her on her return\\nin reference to the person who copied the affidavit in the Chancery\\nsuit, which so powerfully stimulated her curiosity. I have seen\\nhim.\\'\"\\n\\nMy Lady, leaning forward, looks out of her window.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the message,\" observes Sir Leicester.\\n\\n\"I should like to walk a little,\" says my Lady, still looking out of\\nher window.\\n\\n\"Walk?\" repeats Sir Leicester in a tone of surprise.\\n\\n\"I should like to walk a little,\" says my Lady with unmistakable\\ndistinctness. \"Please to stop the carriage.\"\\n\\nThe carriage is stopped, the affectionate man alights from the\\nrumble, opens the door, and lets down the steps, obedient to an\\nimpatient motion of my Lady\\'s hand. My Lady alights so quickly and\\nwalks away so quickly that Sir Leicester, for all his scrupulous\\npoliteness, is unable to assist her, and is left behind. A space of a\\nminute or two has elapsed before he comes up with her. She smiles,\\nlooks very handsome, takes his arm, lounges with him for a quarter of\\na mile, is very much bored, and resumes her seat in the carriage.\\n\\nThe rattle and clatter continue through the greater part of three\\ndays, with more or less of bell-jingling and whip-cracking, and more\\nor less plunging of centaurs and bare-backed horses. Their courtly\\npoliteness to each other at the hotels where they tarry is the theme\\nof general admiration. Though my Lord IS a little aged for my Lady,\\nsays Madame, the hostess of the Golden Ape, and though he might be\\nher amiable father, one can see at a glance that they love each\\nother. One observes my Lord with his white hair, standing, hat in\\nhand, to help my Lady to and from the carriage. One observes my Lady,\\nhow recognisant of my Lord\\'s politeness, with an inclination of her\\ngracious head and the concession of her so-genteel fingers! It is\\nravishing!\\n\\nThe sea has no appreciation of great men, but knocks them about like\\nthe small fry. It is habitually hard upon Sir Leicester, whose\\ncountenance it greenly mottles in the manner of sage-cheese and in\\nwhose aristocratic system it effects a dismal revolution. It is the\\nRadical of Nature to him. Nevertheless, his dignity gets over it\\nafter stopping to refit, and he goes on with my Lady for Chesney\\nWold, lying only one night in London on the way to Lincolnshire.\\n\\nThrough the same cold sunlight, colder as the day declines, and\\nthrough the same sharp wind, sharper as the separate shadows of bare\\ntrees gloom together in the woods, and as the Ghost\\'s Walk, touched\\nat the western corner by a pile of fire in the sky, resigns itself to\\ncoming night, they drive into the park. The rooks, swinging in their\\nlofty houses in the elm-tree avenue, seem to discuss the question of\\nthe occupancy of the carriage as it passes underneath, some agreeing\\nthat Sir Leicester and my Lady are come down, some arguing with\\nmalcontents who won\\'t admit it, now all consenting to consider the\\nquestion disposed of, now all breaking out again in violent debate,\\nincited by one obstinate and drowsy bird who will persist in putting\\nin a last contradictory croak. Leaving them to swing and caw, the\\ntravelling chariot rolls on to the house, where fires gleam warmly\\nthrough some of the windows, though not through so many as to give an\\ninhabited expression to the darkening mass of front. But the\\nbrilliant and distinguished circle will soon do that.\\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell is in attendance and receives Sir Leicester\\'s\\ncustomary shake of the hand with a profound curtsy.\\n\\n\"How do you do, Mrs. Rouncewell? I am glad to see you.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I have the honour of welcoming you in good health, Sir\\nLeicester?\"\\n\\n\"In excellent health, Mrs. Rouncewell.\"\\n\\n\"My Lady is looking charmingly well,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell with\\nanother curtsy.\\n\\nMy Lady signifies, without profuse expenditure of words, that she is\\nas wearily well as she can hope to be.\\n\\nBut Rosa is in the distance, behind the housekeeper; and my Lady, who\\nhas not subdued the quickness of her observation, whatever else she\\nmay have conquered, asks, \"Who is that girl?\"\\n\\n\"A young scholar of mine, my Lady. Rosa.\"\\n\\n\"Come here, Rosa!\" Lady Dedlock beckons her, with even an appearance\\nof interest. \"Why, do you know how pretty you are, child?\" she says,\\ntouching her shoulder with her two forefingers.\\n\\nRosa, very much abashed, says, \"No, if you please, my Lady!\" and\\nglances up, and glances down, and don\\'t know where to look, but looks\\nall the prettier.\\n\\n\"How old are you?\"\\n\\n\"Nineteen, my Lady.\"\\n\\n\"Nineteen,\" repeats my Lady thoughtfully. \"Take care they don\\'t spoil\\nyou by flattery.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my Lady.\"\\n\\nMy Lady taps her dimpled cheek with the same delicate gloved fingers\\nand goes on to the foot of the oak staircase, where Sir Leicester\\npauses for her as her knightly escort. A staring old Dedlock in a\\npanel, as large as life and as dull, looks as if he didn\\'t know what\\nto make of it, which was probably his general state of mind in the\\ndays of Queen Elizabeth.\\n\\nThat evening, in the housekeeper\\'s room, Rosa can do nothing but\\nmurmur Lady Dedlock\\'s praises. She is so affable, so graceful, so\\nbeautiful, so elegant; has such a sweet voice and such a thrilling\\ntouch that Rosa can feel it yet! Mrs. Rouncewell confirms all this,\\nnot without personal pride, reserving only the one point of\\naffability. Mrs. Rouncewell is not quite sure as to that. Heaven\\nforbid that she should say a syllable in dispraise of any member of\\nthat excellent family, above all, of my Lady, whom the whole world\\nadmires; but if my Lady would only be \"a little more free,\" not quite\\nso cold and distant, Mrs. Rouncewell thinks she would be more\\naffable.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis almost a pity,\" Mrs. Rouncewell adds--only \"almost\" because it\\nborders on impiety to suppose that anything could be better than it\\nis, in such an express dispensation as the Dedlock affairs--\"that my\\nLady has no family. If she had had a daughter now, a grown young\\nlady, to interest her, I think she would have had the only kind of\\nexcellence she wants.\"\\n\\n\"Might not that have made her still more proud, grandmother?\" says\\nWatt, who has been home and come back again, he is such a good\\ngrandson.\\n\\n\"More and most, my dear,\" returns the housekeeper with dignity, \"are\\nwords it\\'s not my place to use--nor so much as to hear--applied to\\nany drawback on my Lady.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, grandmother. But she is proud, is she not?\"\\n\\n\"If she is, she has reason to be. The Dedlock family have always\\nreason to be.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" says Watt, \"it\\'s to be hoped they line out of their\\nprayer-books a certain passage for the common people about pride and\\nvainglory. Forgive me, grandmother! Only a joke!\"\\n\\n\"Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock, my dear, are not fit subjects for\\njoking.\"\\n\\n\"Sir Leicester is no joke by any means,\" says Watt, \"and I humbly ask\\nhis pardon. I suppose, grandmother, that even with the family and\\ntheir guests down here, there is no objection to my prolonging my\\nstay at the Dedlock Arms for a day or two, as any other traveller\\nmight?\"\\n\\n\"Surely, none in the world, child.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad of that,\" says Watt, \"because I have an inexpressible\\ndesire to extend my knowledge of this beautiful neighbourhood.\"\\n\\nHe happens to glance at Rosa, who looks down and is very shy indeed.\\nBut according to the old superstition, it should be Rosa\\'s ears that\\nburn, and not her fresh bright cheeks, for my Lady\\'s maid is holding\\nforth about her at this moment with surpassing energy.\\n\\nMy Lady\\'s maid is a Frenchwoman of two and thirty, from somewhere in\\nthe southern country about Avignon and Marseilles, a large-eyed brown\\nwoman with black hair who would be handsome but for a certain feline\\nmouth and general uncomfortable tightness of face, rendering the jaws\\ntoo eager and the skull too prominent. There is something indefinably\\nkeen and wan about her anatomy, and she has a watchful way of looking\\nout of the corners of her eyes without turning her head which could\\nbe pleasantly dispensed with, especially when she is in an ill humour\\nand near knives. Through all the good taste of her dress and little\\nadornments, these objections so express themselves that she seems to\\ngo about like a very neat she-wolf imperfectly tamed. Besides being\\naccomplished in all the knowledge appertaining to her post, she is\\nalmost an Englishwoman in her acquaintance with the language;\\nconsequently, she is in no want of words to shower upon Rosa for\\nhaving attracted my Lady\\'s attention, and she pours them out with\\nsuch grim ridicule as she sits at dinner that her companion, the\\naffectionate man, is rather relieved when she arrives at the spoon\\nstage of that performance.\\n\\nHa, ha, ha! She, Hortense, been in my Lady\\'s service since five years\\nand always kept at the distance, and this doll, this puppet,\\ncaressed--absolutely caressed--by my Lady on the moment of her\\narriving at the house! Ha, ha, ha! \"And do you know how pretty you\\nare, child?\" \"No, my Lady.\" You are right there! \"And how old are\\nyou, child! And take care they do not spoil you by flattery, child!\"\\nOh, how droll! It is the BEST thing altogether.\\n\\nIn short, it is such an admirable thing that Mademoiselle Hortense\\ncan\\'t forget it; but at meals for days afterwards, even among her\\ncountrywomen and others attached in like capacity to the troop of\\nvisitors, relapses into silent enjoyment of the joke--an enjoyment\\nexpressed, in her own convivial manner, by an additional tightness of\\nface, thin elongation of compressed lips, and sidewise look, which\\nintense appreciation of humour is frequently reflected in my Lady\\'s\\nmirrors when my Lady is not among them.\\n\\nAll the mirrors in the house are brought into action now, many of\\nthem after a long blank. They reflect handsome faces, simpering\\nfaces, youthful faces, faces of threescore and ten that will not\\nsubmit to be old; the entire collection of faces that have come to\\npass a January week or two at Chesney Wold, and which the fashionable\\nintelligence, a mighty hunter before the Lord, hunts with a keen\\nscent, from their breaking cover at the Court of St. James\\'s to their\\nbeing run down to death. The place in Lincolnshire is all alive. By\\nday guns and voices are heard ringing in the woods, horsemen and\\ncarriages enliven the park roads, servants and hangers-on pervade the\\nvillage and the Dedlock Arms. Seen by night from distant openings in\\nthe trees, the row of windows in the long drawing-room, where my\\nLady\\'s picture hangs over the great chimney-piece, is like a row of\\njewels set in a black frame. On Sunday the chill little church is\\nalmost warmed by so much gallant company, and the general flavour of\\nthe Dedlock dust is quenched in delicate perfumes.\\n\\nThe brilliant and distinguished circle comprehends within it no\\ncontracted amount of education, sense, courage, honour, beauty, and\\nvirtue. Yet there is something a little wrong about it in despite of\\nits immense advantages. What can it be?\\n\\nDandyism? There is no King George the Fourth now (more the pity) to\\nset the dandy fashion; there are no clear-starched jack-towel\\nneckcloths, no short-waisted coats, no false calves, no stays. There\\nare no caricatures, now, of effeminate exquisites so arrayed,\\nswooning in opera boxes with excess of delight and being revived by\\nother dainty creatures poking long-necked scent-bottles at their\\nnoses. There is no beau whom it takes four men at once to shake into\\nhis buckskins, or who goes to see all the executions, or who is\\ntroubled with the self-reproach of having once consumed a pea. But is\\nthere dandyism in the brilliant and distinguished circle\\nnotwithstanding, dandyism of a more mischievous sort, that has got\\nbelow the surface and is doing less harmless things than\\njack-towelling itself and stopping its own digestion, to which no\\nrational person need particularly object?\\n\\nWhy, yes. It cannot be disguised. There ARE at Chesney Wold this\\nJanuary week some ladies and gentlemen of the newest fashion, who\\nhave set up a dandyism--in religion, for instance. Who in mere\\nlackadaisical want of an emotion have agreed upon a little dandy talk\\nabout the vulgar wanting faith in things in general, meaning in the\\nthings that have been tried and found wanting, as though a low fellow\\nshould unaccountably lose faith in a bad shilling after finding it\\nout! Who would make the vulgar very picturesque and faithful by\\nputting back the hands upon the clock of time and cancelling a few\\nhundred years of history.\\n\\nThere are also ladies and gentlemen of another fashion, not so new,\\nbut very elegant, who have agreed to put a smooth glaze on the world\\nand to keep down all its realities. For whom everything must be\\nlanguid and pretty. Who have found out the perpetual stoppage. Who\\nare to rejoice at nothing and be sorry for nothing. Who are not to be\\ndisturbed by ideas. On whom even the fine arts, attending in powder\\nand walking backward like the Lord Chamberlain, must array themselves\\nin the milliners\\' and tailors\\' patterns of past generations and be\\nparticularly careful not to be in earnest or to receive any impress\\nfrom the moving age.\\n\\nThen there is my Lord Boodle, of considerable reputation with his\\nparty, who has known what office is and who tells Sir Leicester\\nDedlock with much gravity, after dinner, that he really does not see\\nto what the present age is tending. A debate is not what a debate\\nused to be; the House is not what the House used to be; even a\\nCabinet is not what it formerly was. He perceives with astonishment\\nthat supposing the present government to be overthrown, the limited\\nchoice of the Crown, in the formation of a new ministry, would lie\\nbetween Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle--supposing it to be\\nimpossible for the Duke of Foodle to act with Goodle, which may be\\nassumed to be the case in consequence of the breach arising out of\\nthat affair with Hoodle. Then, giving the Home Department and the\\nleadership of the House of Commons to Joodle, the Exchequer to\\nKoodle, the Colonies to Loodle, and the Foreign Office to Moodle,\\nwhat are you to do with Noodle? You can\\'t offer him the Presidency of\\nthe Council; that is reserved for Poodle. You can\\'t put him in the\\nWoods and Forests; that is hardly good enough for Quoodle. What\\nfollows? That the country is shipwrecked, lost, and gone to pieces\\n(as is made manifest to the patriotism of Sir Leicester Dedlock)\\nbecause you can\\'t provide for Noodle!\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Right Honourable William Buffy, M.P., contends\\nacross the table with some one else that the shipwreck of the\\ncountry--about which there is no doubt; it is only the manner of it\\nthat is in question--is attributable to Cuffy. If you had done with\\nCuffy what you ought to have done when he first came into Parliament,\\nand had prevented him from going over to Duffy, you would have got\\nhim into alliance with Fuffy, you would have had with you the weight\\nattaching as a smart debater to Guffy, you would have brought to bear\\nupon the elections the wealth of Huffy, you would have got in for\\nthree counties Juffy, Kuffy, and Luffy, and you would have\\nstrengthened your administration by the official knowledge and the\\nbusiness habits of Muffy. All this, instead of being as you now are,\\ndependent on the mere caprice of Puffy!\\n\\nAs to this point, and as to some minor topics, there are differences\\nof opinion; but it is perfectly clear to the brilliant and\\ndistinguished circle, all round, that nobody is in question but\\nBoodle and his retinue, and Buffy and HIS retinue. These are the\\ngreat actors for whom the stage is reserved. A People there are, no\\ndoubt--a certain large number of supernumeraries, who are to be\\noccasionally addressed, and relied upon for shouts and choruses, as\\non the theatrical stage; but Boodle and Buffy, their followers and\\nfamilies, their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, are\\nthe born first-actors, managers, and leaders, and no others can\\nappear upon the scene for ever and ever.\\n\\nIn this, too, there is perhaps more dandyism at Chesney Wold than the\\nbrilliant and distinguished circle will find good for itself in the\\nlong run. For it is, even with the stillest and politest circles, as\\nwith the circle the necromancer draws around him--very strange\\nappearances may be seen in active motion outside. With this\\ndifference, that being realities and not phantoms, there is the\\ngreater danger of their breaking in.\\n\\nChesney Wold is quite full anyhow, so full that a burning sense of\\ninjury arises in the breasts of ill-lodged ladies\\'-maids, and is not\\nto be extinguished. Only one room is empty. It is a turret chamber of\\nthe third order of merit, plainly but comfortably furnished and\\nhaving an old-fashioned business air. It is Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s room,\\nand is never bestowed on anybody else, for he may come at any time.\\nHe is not come yet. It is his quiet habit to walk across the park\\nfrom the village in fine weather, to drop into this room as if he had\\nnever been out of it since he was last seen there, to request a\\nservant to inform Sir Leicester that he is arrived in case he should\\nbe wanted, and to appear ten minutes before dinner in the shadow of\\nthe library-door. He sleeps in his turret with a complaining\\nflag-staff over his head, and has some leads outside on which, any\\nfine morning when he is down here, his black figure may be seen\\nwalking before breakfast like a larger species of rook.\\n\\nEvery day before dinner, my Lady looks for him in the dusk of the\\nlibrary, but he is not there. Every day at dinner, my Lady glances\\ndown the table for the vacant place that would be waiting to receive\\nhim if he had just arrived, but there is no vacant place. Every night\\nmy Lady casually asks her maid, \"Is Mr. Tulkinghorn come?\"\\n\\nEvery night the answer is, \"No, my Lady, not yet.\"\\n\\nOne night, while having her hair undressed, my Lady loses herself in\\ndeep thought after this reply until she sees her own brooding face in\\nthe opposite glass, and a pair of black eyes curiously observing her.\\n\\n\"Be so good as to attend,\" says my Lady then, addressing the\\nreflection of Hortense, \"to your business. You can contemplate your\\nbeauty at another time.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon! It was your Ladyship\\'s beauty.\"\\n\\n\"That,\" says my Lady, \"you needn\\'t contemplate at all.\"\\n\\nAt length, one afternoon a little before sunset, when the bright\\ngroups of figures which have for the last hour or two enlivened the\\nGhost\\'s Walk are all dispersed and only Sir Leicester and my Lady\\nremain upon the terrace, Mr. Tulkinghorn appears. He comes towards\\nthem at his usual methodical pace, which is never quickened, never\\nslackened. He wears his usual expressionless mask--if it be a\\nmask--and carries family secrets in every limb of his body and every\\ncrease of his dress. Whether his whole soul is devoted to the great\\nor whether he yields them nothing beyond the services he sells is his\\npersonal secret. He keeps it, as he keeps the secrets of his clients;\\nhe is his own client in that matter, and will never betray himself.\\n\\n\"How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?\" says Sir Leicester, giving him his\\nhand.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn is quite well. Sir Leicester is quite well. My Lady\\nis quite well. All highly satisfactory. The lawyer, with his hands\\nbehind him, walks at Sir Leicester\\'s side along the terrace. My Lady\\nwalks upon the other side.\\n\\n\"We expected you before,\" says Sir Leicester. A gracious observation.\\nAs much as to say, \"Mr. Tulkinghorn, we remember your existence when\\nyou are not here to remind us of it by your presence. We bestow a\\nfragment of our minds upon you, sir, you see!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn, comprehending it, inclines his head and says he is\\nmuch obliged.\\n\\n\"I should have come down sooner,\" he explains, \"but that I have been\\nmuch engaged with those matters in the several suits between yourself\\nand Boythorn.\"\\n\\n\"A man of a very ill-regulated mind,\" observes Sir Leicester with\\nseverity. \"An extremely dangerous person in any community. A man of a\\nvery low character of mind.\"\\n\\n\"He is obstinate,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"It is natural to such a man to be so,\" says Sir Leicester, looking\\nmost profoundly obstinate himself. \"I am not at all surprised to hear\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"The only question is,\" pursues the lawyer, \"whether you will give up\\nanything.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replies Sir Leicester. \"Nothing. I give up?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mean anything of importance. That, of course, I know you\\nwould not abandon. I mean any minor point.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" returns Sir Leicester, \"there can be no minor\\npoint between myself and Mr. Boythorn. If I go farther, and observe\\nthat I cannot readily conceive how ANY right of mine can be a minor\\npoint, I speak not so much in reference to myself as an individual as\\nin reference to the family position I have it in charge to maintain.\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn inclines his head again. \"I have now my\\ninstructions,\" he says. \"Mr. Boythorn will give us a good deal of\\ntrouble--\"\\n\\n\"It is the character of such a mind, Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" Sir Leicester\\ninterrupts him, \"TO give trouble. An exceedingly ill-conditioned,\\nlevelling person. A person who, fifty years ago, would probably have\\nbeen tried at the Old Bailey for some demagogue proceeding, and\\nseverely punished--if not,\" adds Sir Leicester after a moment\\'s\\npause, \"if not hanged, drawn, and quartered.\"\\n\\nSir Leicester appears to discharge his stately breast of a burden in\\npassing this capital sentence, as if it were the next satisfactory\\nthing to having the sentence executed.\\n\\n\"But night is coming on,\" says he, \"and my Lady will take cold. My\\ndear, let us go in.\"\\n\\nAs they turn towards the hall-door, Lady Dedlock addresses Mr.\\nTulkinghorn for the first time.\\n\\n\"You sent me a message respecting the person whose writing I happened\\nto inquire about. It was like you to remember the circumstance; I had\\nquite forgotten it. Your message reminded me of it again. I can\\'t\\nimagine what association I had with a hand like that, but I surely\\nhad some.\"\\n\\n\"You had some?\" Mr. Tulkinghorn repeats.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" returns my Lady carelessly. \"I think I must have had some.\\nAnd did you really take the trouble to find out the writer of that\\nactual thing--what is it!--affidavit?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"How very odd!\"\\n\\nThey pass into a sombre breakfast-room on the ground floor, lighted\\nin the day by two deep windows. It is now twilight. The fire glows\\nbrightly on the panelled wall and palely on the window-glass, where,\\nthrough the cold reflection of the blaze, the colder landscape\\nshudders in the wind and a grey mist creeps along, the only traveller\\nbesides the waste of clouds.\\n\\nMy Lady lounges in a great chair in the chimney-corner, and Sir\\nLeicester takes another great chair opposite. The lawyer stands\\nbefore the fire with his hand out at arm\\'s length, shading his face.\\nHe looks across his arm at my Lady.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he says, \"I inquired about the man, and found him. And, what\\nis very strange, I found him--\"\\n\\n\"Not to be any out-of-the-way person, I am afraid!\" Lady Dedlock\\nlanguidly anticipates.\\n\\n\"I found him dead.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear me!\" remonstrated Sir Leicester. Not so much shocked by the\\nfact as by the fact of the fact being mentioned.\\n\\n\"I was directed to his lodging--a miserable, poverty-stricken\\nplace--and I found him dead.\"\\n\\n\"You will excuse me, Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" observes Sir Leicester. \"I\\nthink the less said--\"\\n\\n\"Pray, Sir Leicester, let me hear the story out\" (it is my Lady\\nspeaking). \"It is quite a story for twilight. How very shocking!\\nDead?\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn re-asserts it by another inclination of his head.\\n\"Whether by his own hand--\"\\n\\n\"Upon my honour!\" cries Sir Leicester. \"Really!\"\\n\\n\"Do let me hear the story!\" says my Lady.\\n\\n\"Whatever you desire, my dear. But, I must say--\"\\n\\n\"No, you mustn\\'t say! Go on, Mr. Tulkinghorn.\"\\n\\nSir Leicester\\'s gallantry concedes the point, though he still feels\\nthat to bring this sort of squalor among the upper classes is\\nreally--really--\\n\\n\"I was about to say,\" resumes the lawyer with undisturbed calmness,\\n\"that whether he had died by his own hand or not, it was beyond my\\npower to tell you. I should amend that phrase, however, by saying\\nthat he had unquestionably died of his own act, though whether by his\\nown deliberate intention or by mischance can never certainly be\\nknown. The coroner\\'s jury found that he took the poison\\naccidentally.\"\\n\\n\"And what kind of man,\" my Lady asks, \"was this deplorable creature?\"\\n\\n\"Very difficult to say,\" returns the lawyer, shaking his head. \"He\\nhad lived so wretchedly and was so neglected, with his gipsy colour\\nand his wild black hair and beard, that I should have considered him\\nthe commonest of the common. The surgeon had a notion that he had\\nonce been something better, both in appearance and condition.\"\\n\\n\"What did they call the wretched being?\"\\n\\n\"They called him what he had called himself, but no one knew his\\nname.\"\\n\\n\"Not even any one who had attended on him?\"\\n\\n\"No one had attended on him. He was found dead. In fact, I found\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"Without any clue to anything more?\"\\n\\n\"Without any; there was,\" says the lawyer meditatively, \"an old\\nportmanteau, but--No, there were no papers.\"\\n\\nDuring the utterance of every word of this short dialogue, Lady\\nDedlock and Mr. Tulkinghorn, without any other alteration in their\\ncustomary deportment, have looked very steadily at one another--as\\nwas natural, perhaps, in the discussion of so unusual a subject. Sir\\nLeicester has looked at the fire, with the general expression of the\\nDedlock on the staircase. The story being told, he renews his stately\\nprotest, saying that as it is quite clear that no association in my\\nLady\\'s mind can possibly be traceable to this poor wretch (unless he\\nwas a begging-letter writer), he trusts to hear no more about a\\nsubject so far removed from my Lady\\'s station.\\n\\n\"Certainly, a collection of horrors,\" says my Lady, gathering up her\\nmantles and furs, \"but they interest one for the moment! Have the\\nkindness, Mr. Tulkinghorn, to open the door for me.\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn does so with deference and holds it open while she\\npasses out. She passes close to him, with her usual fatigued manner\\nand insolent grace. They meet again at dinner--again, next\\nday--again, for many days in succession. Lady Dedlock is always the\\nsame exhausted deity, surrounded by worshippers, and terribly liable\\nto be bored to death, even while presiding at her own shrine. Mr.\\nTulkinghorn is always the same speechless repository of noble\\nconfidences, so oddly out of place and yet so perfectly at home. They\\nappear to take as little note of one another as any two people\\nenclosed within the same walls could. But whether each evermore\\nwatches and suspects the other, evermore mistrustful of some great\\nreservation; whether each is evermore prepared at all points for the\\nother, and never to be taken unawares; what each would give to know\\nhow much the other knows--all this is hidden, for the time, in their\\nown hearts.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe held many consultations about what Richard was to be, first\\nwithout Mr. Jarndyce, as he had requested, and afterwards with him,\\nbut it was a long time before we seemed to make progress. Richard\\nsaid he was ready for anything. When Mr. Jarndyce doubted whether he\\nmight not already be too old to enter the Navy, Richard said he had\\nthought of that, and perhaps he was. When Mr. Jarndyce asked him what\\nhe thought of the Army, Richard said he had thought of that, too, and\\nit wasn\\'t a bad idea. When Mr. Jarndyce advised him to try and decide\\nwithin himself whether his old preference for the sea was an ordinary\\nboyish inclination or a strong impulse, Richard answered, Well he\\nreally HAD tried very often, and he couldn\\'t make out.\\n\\n\"How much of this indecision of character,\" Mr. Jarndyce said to me,\\n\"is chargeable on that incomprehensible heap of uncertainty and\\nprocrastination on which he has been thrown from his birth, I don\\'t\\npretend to say; but that Chancery, among its other sins, is\\nresponsible for some of it, I can plainly see. It has engendered or\\nconfirmed in him a habit of putting off--and trusting to this, that,\\nand the other chance, without knowing what chance--and dismissing\\neverything as unsettled, uncertain, and confused. The character of\\nmuch older and steadier people may be even changed by the\\ncircumstances surrounding them. It would be too much to expect that a\\nboy\\'s, in its formation, should be the subject of such influences and\\nescape them.\"\\n\\nI felt this to be true; though if I may venture to mention what I\\nthought besides, I thought it much to be regretted that Richard\\'s\\neducation had not counteracted those influences or directed his\\ncharacter. He had been eight years at a public school and had learnt,\\nI understood, to make Latin verses of several sorts in the most\\nadmirable manner. But I never heard that it had been anybody\\'s\\nbusiness to find out what his natural bent was, or where his failings\\nlay, or to adapt any kind of knowledge to HIM. HE had been adapted to\\nthe verses and had learnt the art of making them to such perfection\\nthat if he had remained at school until he was of age, I suppose he\\ncould only have gone on making them over and over again unless he had\\nenlarged his education by forgetting how to do it. Still, although I\\nhad no doubt that they were very beautiful, and very improving, and\\nvery sufficient for a great many purposes of life, and always\\nremembered all through life, I did doubt whether Richard would not\\nhave profited by some one studying him a little, instead of his\\nstudying them quite so much.\\n\\nTo be sure, I knew nothing of the subject and do not even now know\\nwhether the young gentlemen of classic Rome or Greece made verses to\\nthe same extent--or whether the young gentlemen of any country ever\\ndid.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t the least idea,\" said Richard, musing, \"what I had better\\nbe. Except that I am quite sure I don\\'t want to go into the Church,\\nit\\'s a toss-up.\"\\n\\n\"You have no inclination in Mr. Kenge\\'s way?\" suggested Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know that, sir!\" replied Richard. \"I am fond of boating.\\nArticled clerks go a good deal on the water. It\\'s a capital\\nprofession!\"\\n\\n\"Surgeon--\" suggested Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the thing, sir!\" cried Richard.\\n\\nI doubt if he had ever once thought of it before.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the thing, sir,\" repeated Richard with the greatest\\nenthusiasm. \"We have got it at last. M.R.C.S.!\"\\n\\nHe was not to be laughed out of it, though he laughed at it heartily.\\nHe said he had chosen his profession, and the more he thought of it,\\nthe more he felt that his destiny was clear; the art of healing was\\nthe art of all others for him. Mistrusting that he only came to this\\nconclusion because, having never had much chance of finding out for\\nhimself what he was fitted for and having never been guided to the\\ndiscovery, he was taken by the newest idea and was glad to get rid of\\nthe trouble of consideration, I wondered whether the Latin verses\\noften ended in this or whether Richard\\'s was a solitary case.\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce took great pains to talk with him seriously and to put\\nit to his good sense not to deceive himself in so important a matter.\\nRichard was a little grave after these interviews, but invariably\\ntold Ada and me that it was all right, and then began to talk about\\nsomething else.\\n\\n\"By heaven!\" cried Mr. Boythorn, who interested himself strongly in\\nthe subject--though I need not say that, for he could do nothing\\nweakly; \"I rejoice to find a young gentleman of spirit and gallantry\\ndevoting himself to that noble profession! The more spirit there is\\nin it, the better for mankind and the worse for those mercenary\\ntask-masters and low tricksters who delight in putting that\\nillustrious art at a disadvantage in the world. By all that is base\\nand despicable,\" cried Mr. Boythorn, \"the treatment of surgeons\\naboard ship is such that I would submit the legs--both legs--of every\\nmember of the Admiralty Board to a compound fracture and render it a\\ntransportable offence in any qualified practitioner to set them if\\nthe system were not wholly changed in eight and forty hours!\"\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t you give them a week?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"No!\" cried Mr. Boythorn firmly. \"Not on any consideration! Eight and\\nforty hours! As to corporations, parishes, vestry-boards, and similar\\ngatherings of jolter-headed clods who assemble to exchange such\\nspeeches that, by heaven, they ought to be worked in quicksilver\\nmines for the short remainder of their miserable existence, if it\\nwere only to prevent their detestable English from contaminating a\\nlanguage spoken in the presence of the sun--as to those fellows, who\\nmeanly take advantage of the ardour of gentlemen in the pursuit of\\nknowledge to recompense the inestimable services of the best years of\\ntheir lives, their long study, and their expensive education with\\npittances too small for the acceptance of clerks, I would have the\\nnecks of every one of them wrung and their skulls arranged in\\nSurgeons\\' Hall for the contemplation of the whole profession in order\\nthat its younger members might understand from actual measurement, in\\nearly life, HOW thick skulls may become!\"\\n\\nHe wound up this vehement declaration by looking round upon us with a\\nmost agreeable smile and suddenly thundering, \"Ha, ha, ha!\" over and\\nover again, until anybody else might have been expected to be quite\\nsubdued by the exertion.\\n\\nAs Richard still continued to say that he was fixed in his choice\\nafter repeated periods for consideration had been recommended by Mr.\\nJarndyce and had expired, and he still continued to assure Ada and me\\nin the same final manner that it was \"all right,\" it became advisable\\nto take Mr. Kenge into council. Mr. Kenge, therefore, came down to\\ndinner one day, and leaned back in his chair, and turned his\\neye-glasses over and over, and spoke in a sonorous voice, and did\\nexactly what I remembered to have seen him do when I was a little\\ngirl.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Yes. Well! A very good profession, Mr.\\nJarndyce, a very good profession.\"\\n\\n\"The course of study and preparation requires to be diligently\\npursued,\" observed my guardian with a glance at Richard.\\n\\n\"Oh, no doubt,\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Diligently.\"\\n\\n\"But that being the case, more or less, with all pursuits that are\\nworth much,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"it is not a special consideration\\nwhich another choice would be likely to escape.\"\\n\\n\"Truly,\" said Mr. Kenge. \"And Mr. Richard Carstone, who has so\\nmeritoriously acquitted himself in the--shall I say the classic\\nshades?--in which his youth had been passed, will, no doubt, apply\\nthe habits, if not the principles and practice, of versification in\\nthat tongue in which a poet was said (unless I mistake) to be born,\\nnot made, to the more eminently practical field of action on which he\\nenters.\"\\n\\n\"You may rely upon it,\" said Richard in his off-hand manner, \"that I\\nshall go at it and do my best.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, Mr. Jarndyce!\" said Mr. Kenge, gently nodding his head.\\n\"Really, when we are assured by Mr. Richard that he means to go at it\\nand to do his best,\" nodding feelingly and smoothly over those\\nexpressions, \"I would submit to you that we have only to inquire into\\nthe best mode of carrying out the object of his ambition. Now, with\\nreference to placing Mr. Richard with some sufficiently eminent\\npractitioner. Is there any one in view at present?\"\\n\\n\"No one, Rick, I think?\" said my guardian.\\n\\n\"No one, sir,\" said Richard.\\n\\n\"Quite so!\" observed Mr. Kenge. \"As to situation, now. Is there any\\nparticular feeling on that head?\"\\n\\n\"N--no,\" said Richard.\\n\\n\"Quite so!\" observed Mr. Kenge again.\\n\\n\"I should like a little variety,\" said Richard; \"I mean a good range\\nof experience.\"\\n\\n\"Very requisite, no doubt,\" returned Mr. Kenge. \"I think this may be\\neasily arranged, Mr. Jarndyce? We have only, in the first place, to\\ndiscover a sufficiently eligible practitioner; and as soon as we make\\nour want--and shall I add, our ability to pay a premium?--known, our\\nonly difficulty will be in the selection of one from a large number.\\nWe have only, in the second place, to observe those little\\nformalities which are rendered necessary by our time of life and our\\nbeing under the guardianship of the court. We shall soon be--shall I\\nsay, in Mr. Richard\\'s own light-hearted manner, \\'going at it\\'--to our\\nheart\\'s content. It is a coincidence,\" said Mr. Kenge with a tinge of\\nmelancholy in his smile, \"one of those coincidences which may or may\\nnot require an explanation beyond our present limited faculties, that\\nI have a cousin in the medical profession. He might be deemed\\neligible by you and might be disposed to respond to this proposal. I\\ncan answer for him as little as for you, but he MIGHT!\"\\n\\nAs this was an opening in the prospect, it was arranged that Mr.\\nKenge should see his cousin. And as Mr. Jarndyce had before proposed\\nto take us to London for a few weeks, it was settled next day that we\\nshould make our visit at once and combine Richard\\'s business with it.\\n\\nMr. Boythorn leaving us within a week, we took up our abode at a\\ncheerful lodging near Oxford Street over an upholsterer\\'s shop.\\nLondon was a great wonder to us, and we were out for hours and hours\\nat a time, seeing the sights, which appeared to be less capable of\\nexhaustion than we were. We made the round of the principal theatres,\\ntoo, with great delight, and saw all the plays that were worth\\nseeing. I mention this because it was at the theatre that I began to\\nbe made uncomfortable again by Mr. Guppy.\\n\\nI was sitting in front of the box one night with Ada, and Richard was\\nin the place he liked best, behind Ada\\'s chair, when, happening to\\nlook down into the pit, I saw Mr. Guppy, with his hair flattened down\\nupon his head and woe depicted in his face, looking up at me. I felt\\nall through the performance that he never looked at the actors but\\nconstantly looked at me, and always with a carefully prepared\\nexpression of the deepest misery and the profoundest dejection.\\n\\nIt quite spoiled my pleasure for that night because it was so very\\nembarrassing and so very ridiculous. But from that time forth, we\\nnever went to the play without my seeing Mr. Guppy in the pit, always\\nwith his hair straight and flat, his shirt-collar turned down, and a\\ngeneral feebleness about him. If he were not there when we went in,\\nand I began to hope he would not come and yielded myself for a little\\nwhile to the interest of the scene, I was certain to encounter his\\nlanguishing eyes when I least expected it and, from that time, to be\\nquite sure that they were fixed upon me all the evening.\\n\\nI really cannot express how uneasy this made me. If he would only\\nhave brushed up his hair or turned up his collar, it would have been\\nbad enough; but to know that that absurd figure was always gazing at\\nme, and always in that demonstrative state of despondency, put such a\\nconstraint upon me that I did not like to laugh at the play, or to\\ncry at it, or to move, or to speak. I seemed able to do nothing\\nnaturally. As to escaping Mr. Guppy by going to the back of the box,\\nI could not bear to do that because I knew Richard and Ada relied on\\nhaving me next them and that they could never have talked together so\\nhappily if anybody else had been in my place. So there I sat, not\\nknowing where to look--for wherever I looked, I knew Mr. Guppy\\'s eyes\\nwere following me--and thinking of the dreadful expense to which this\\nyoung man was putting himself on my account.\\n\\nSometimes I thought of telling Mr. Jarndyce. Then I feared that the\\nyoung man would lose his situation and that I might ruin him.\\nSometimes I thought of confiding in Richard, but was deterred by the\\npossibility of his fighting Mr. Guppy and giving him black eyes.\\nSometimes I thought, should I frown at him or shake my head. Then I\\nfelt I could not do it. Sometimes I considered whether I should write\\nto his mother, but that ended in my being convinced that to open a\\ncorrespondence would be to make the matter worse. I always came to\\nthe conclusion, finally, that I could do nothing. Mr. Guppy\\'s\\nperseverance, all this time, not only produced him regularly at any\\ntheatre to which we went, but caused him to appear in the crowd as we\\nwere coming out, and even to get up behind our fly--where I am sure I\\nsaw him, two or three times, struggling among the most dreadful\\nspikes. After we got home, he haunted a post opposite our house. The\\nupholsterer\\'s where we lodged being at the corner of two streets, and\\nmy bedroom window being opposite the post, I was afraid to go near\\nthe window when I went upstairs, lest I should see him (as I did one\\nmoonlight night) leaning against the post and evidently catching\\ncold. If Mr. Guppy had not been, fortunately for me, engaged in the\\ndaytime, I really should have had no rest from him.\\n\\nWhile we were making this round of gaieties, in which Mr. Guppy so\\nextraordinarily participated, the business which had helped to bring\\nus to town was not neglected. Mr. Kenge\\'s cousin was a Mr. Bayham\\nBadger, who had a good practice at Chelsea and attended a large\\npublic institution besides. He was quite willing to receive Richard\\ninto his house and to superintend his studies, and as it seemed that\\nthose could be pursued advantageously under Mr. Badger\\'s roof, and\\nMr. Badger liked Richard, and as Richard said he liked Mr. Badger\\n\"well enough,\" an agreement was made, the Lord Chancellor\\'s consent\\nwas obtained, and it was all settled.\\n\\nOn the day when matters were concluded between Richard and Mr.\\nBadger, we were all under engagement to dine at Mr. Badger\\'s house.\\nWe were to be \"merely a family party,\" Mrs. Badger\\'s note said; and\\nwe found no lady there but Mrs. Badger herself. She was surrounded in\\nthe drawing-room by various objects, indicative of her painting a\\nlittle, playing the piano a little, playing the guitar a little,\\nplaying the harp a little, singing a little, working a little,\\nreading a little, writing poetry a little, and botanizing a little.\\nShe was a lady of about fifty, I should think, youthfully dressed,\\nand of a very fine complexion. If I add to the little list of her\\naccomplishments that she rouged a little, I do not mean that there\\nwas any harm in it.\\n\\nMr. Bayham Badger himself was a pink, fresh-faced, crisp-looking\\ngentleman with a weak voice, white teeth, light hair, and surprised\\neyes, some years younger, I should say, than Mrs. Bayham Badger. He\\nadmired her exceedingly, but principally, and to begin with, on the\\ncurious ground (as it seemed to us) of her having had three husbands.\\nWe had barely taken our seats when he said to Mr. Jarndyce quite\\ntriumphantly, \"You would hardly suppose that I am Mrs. Bayham\\nBadger\\'s third!\"\\n\\n\"Indeed?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Her third!\" said Mr. Badger. \"Mrs. Bayham Badger has not the\\nappearance, Miss Summerson, of a lady who has had two former\\nhusbands?\"\\n\\nI said \"Not at all!\"\\n\\n\"And most remarkable men!\" said Mr. Badger in a tone of confidence.\\n\"Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy, who was Mrs. Badger\\'s first\\nhusband, was a very distinguished officer indeed. The name of\\nProfessor Dingo, my immediate predecessor, is one of European\\nreputation.\"\\n\\nMrs. Badger overheard him and smiled.\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear!\" Mr. Badger replied to the smile, \"I was observing to\\nMr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson that you had had two former\\nhusbands--both very distinguished men. And they found it, as people\\ngenerally do, difficult to believe.\"\\n\\n\"I was barely twenty,\" said Mrs. Badger, \"when I married Captain\\nSwosser of the Royal Navy. I was in the Mediterranean with him; I am\\nquite a sailor. On the twelfth anniversary of my wedding-day, I\\nbecame the wife of Professor Dingo.\"\\n\\n\"Of European reputation,\" added Mr. Badger in an undertone.\\n\\n\"And when Mr. Badger and myself were married,\" pursued Mrs. Badger,\\n\"we were married on the same day of the year. I had become attached\\nto the day.\"\\n\\n\"So that Mrs. Badger has been married to three husbands--two of them\\nhighly distinguished men,\" said Mr. Badger, summing up the facts,\\n\"and each time upon the twenty-first of March at eleven in the\\nforenoon!\"\\n\\nWe all expressed our admiration.\\n\\n\"But for Mr. Badger\\'s modesty,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"I would take\\nleave to correct him and say three distinguished men.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Mr. Jarndyce! What I always tell him!\" observed Mrs.\\nBadger.\\n\\n\"And, my dear,\" said Mr. Badger, \"what do I always tell you? That\\nwithout any affectation of disparaging such professional distinction\\nas I may have attained (which our friend Mr. Carstone will have many\\nopportunities of estimating), I am not so weak--no, really,\" said Mr.\\nBadger to us generally, \"so unreasonable--as to put my reputation on\\nthe same footing with such first-rate men as Captain Swosser and\\nProfessor Dingo. Perhaps you may be interested, Mr. Jarndyce,\"\\ncontinued Mr. Bayham Badger, leading the way into the next\\ndrawing-room, \"in this portrait of Captain Swosser. It was taken on\\nhis return home from the African station, where he had suffered from\\nthe fever of the country. Mrs. Badger considers it too yellow. But\\nit\\'s a very fine head. A very fine head!\"\\n\\nWe all echoed, \"A very fine head!\"\\n\\n\"I feel when I look at it,\" said Mr. Badger, \"\\'That\\'s a man I should\\nlike to have seen!\\' It strikingly bespeaks the first-class man that\\nCaptain Swosser pre-eminently was. On the other side, Professor\\nDingo. I knew him well--attended him in his last illness--a speaking\\nlikeness! Over the piano, Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Swosser. Over\\nthe sofa, Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Dingo. Of Mrs. Bayham Badger\\nIN ESSE, I possess the original and have no copy.\"\\n\\nDinner was now announced, and we went downstairs. It was a very\\ngenteel entertainment, very handsomely served. But the captain and\\nthe professor still ran in Mr. Badger\\'s head, and as Ada and I had\\nthe honour of being under his particular care, we had the full\\nbenefit of them.\\n\\n\"Water, Miss Summerson? Allow me! Not in that tumbler, pray. Bring me\\nthe professor\\'s goblet, James!\"\\n\\nAda very much admired some artificial flowers under a glass.\\n\\n\"Astonishing how they keep!\" said Mr. Badger. \"They were presented to\\nMrs. Bayham Badger when she was in the Mediterranean.\"\\n\\nHe invited Mr. Jarndyce to take a glass of claret.\\n\\n\"Not that claret!\" he said. \"Excuse me! This is an occasion, and ON\\nan occasion I produce some very special claret I happen to have.\\n(James, Captain Swosser\\'s wine!) Mr. Jarndyce, this is a wine that\\nwas imported by the captain, we will not say how many years ago. You\\nwill find it very curious. My dear, I shall be happy to take some of\\nthis wine with you. (Captain Swosser\\'s claret to your mistress,\\nJames!) My love, your health!\"\\n\\nAfter dinner, when we ladies retired, we took Mrs. Badger\\'s first and\\nsecond husband with us. Mrs. Badger gave us in the drawing-room a\\nbiographical sketch of the life and services of Captain Swosser\\nbefore his marriage and a more minute account of him dating from the\\ntime when he fell in love with her at a ball on board the Crippler,\\ngiven to the officers of that ship when she lay in Plymouth Harbour.\\n\\n\"The dear old Crippler!\" said Mrs. Badger, shaking her head. \"She was\\na noble vessel. Trim, ship-shape, all a taunto, as Captain Swosser\\nused to say. You must excuse me if I occasionally introduce a\\nnautical expression; I was quite a sailor once. Captain Swosser loved\\nthat craft for my sake. When she was no longer in commission, he\\nfrequently said that if he were rich enough to buy her old hulk, he\\nwould have an inscription let into the timbers of the quarter-deck\\nwhere we stood as partners in the dance to mark the spot where he\\nfell--raked fore and aft (Captain Swosser used to say) by the fire\\nfrom my tops. It was his naval way of mentioning my eyes.\"\\n\\nMrs. Badger shook her head, sighed, and looked in the glass.\\n\\n\"It was a great change from Captain Swosser to Professor Dingo,\" she\\nresumed with a plaintive smile. \"I felt it a good deal at first. Such\\nan entire revolution in my mode of life! But custom, combined with\\nscience--particularly science--inured me to it. Being the professor\\'s\\nsole companion in his botanical excursions, I almost forgot that I\\nhad ever been afloat, and became quite learned. It is singular that\\nthe professor was the antipodes of Captain Swosser and that Mr.\\nBadger is not in the least like either!\"\\n\\nWe then passed into a narrative of the deaths of Captain Swosser and\\nProfessor Dingo, both of whom seem to have had very bad complaints.\\nIn the course of it, Mrs. Badger signified to us that she had never\\nmadly loved but once and that the object of that wild affection,\\nnever to be recalled in its fresh enthusiasm, was Captain Swosser.\\nThe professor was yet dying by inches in the most dismal manner, and\\nMrs. Badger was giving us imitations of his way of saying, with great\\ndifficulty, \"Where is Laura? Let Laura give me my toast and water!\"\\nwhen the entrance of the gentlemen consigned him to the tomb.\\n\\nNow, I observed that evening, as I had observed for some days past,\\nthat Ada and Richard were more than ever attached to each other\\'s\\nsociety, which was but natural, seeing that they were going to be\\nseparated so soon. I was therefore not very much surprised when we\\ngot home, and Ada and I retired upstairs, to find Ada more silent\\nthan usual, though I was not quite prepared for her coming into my\\narms and beginning to speak to me, with her face hidden.\\n\\n\"My darling Esther!\" murmured Ada. \"I have a great secret to tell\\nyou!\"\\n\\nA mighty secret, my pretty one, no doubt!\\n\\n\"What is it, Ada?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Esther, you would never guess!\"\\n\\n\"Shall I try to guess?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh, no! Don\\'t! Pray don\\'t!\" cried Ada, very much startled by the\\nidea of my doing so.\\n\\n\"Now, I wonder who it can be about?\" said I, pretending to consider.\\n\\n\"It\\'s about--\" said Ada in a whisper. \"It\\'s about--my cousin\\nRichard!\"\\n\\n\"Well, my own!\" said I, kissing her bright hair, which was all I\\ncould see. \"And what about him?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Esther, you would never guess!\"\\n\\nIt was so pretty to have her clinging to me in that way, hiding her\\nface, and to know that she was not crying in sorrow but in a little\\nglow of joy, and pride, and hope, that I would not help her just yet.\\n\\n\"He says--I know it\\'s very foolish, we are both so young--but he\\nsays,\" with a burst of tears, \"that he loves me dearly, Esther.\"\\n\\n\"Does he indeed?\" said I. \"I never heard of such a thing! Why, my pet\\nof pets, I could have told you that weeks and weeks ago!\"\\n\\nTo see Ada lift up her flushed face in joyful surprise, and hold me\\nround the neck, and laugh, and cry, and blush, was so pleasant!\\n\\n\"Why, my darling,\" said I, \"what a goose you must take me for! Your\\ncousin Richard has been loving you as plainly as he could for I don\\'t\\nknow how long!\"\\n\\n\"And yet you never said a word about it!\" cried Ada, kissing me.\\n\\n\"No, my love,\" said I. \"I waited to be told.\"\\n\\n\"But now I have told you, you don\\'t think it wrong of me, do you?\"\\nreturned Ada. She might have coaxed me to say no if I had been the\\nhardest-hearted duenna in the world. Not being that yet, I said no\\nvery freely.\\n\\n\"And now,\" said I, \"I know the worst of it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s not quite the worst of it, Esther dear!\" cried Ada,\\nholding me tighter and laying down her face again upon my breast.\\n\\n\"No?\" said I. \"Not even that?\"\\n\\n\"No, not even that!\" said Ada, shaking her head.\\n\\n\"Why, you never mean to say--\" I was beginning in joke.\\n\\nBut Ada, looking up and smiling through her tears, cried, \"Yes, I do!\\nYou know, you know I do!\" And then sobbed out, \"With all my heart I\\ndo! With all my whole heart, Esther!\"\\n\\nI told her, laughing, why I had known that, too, just as well as I\\nhad known the other! And we sat before the fire, and I had all the\\ntalking to myself for a little while (though there was not much of\\nit); and Ada was soon quiet and happy.\\n\\n\"Do you think my cousin John knows, dear Dame Durden?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Unless my cousin John is blind, my pet,\" said I, \"I should think my\\ncousin John knows pretty well as much as we know.\"\\n\\n\"We want to speak to him before Richard goes,\" said Ada timidly, \"and\\nwe wanted you to advise us, and to tell him so. Perhaps you wouldn\\'t\\nmind Richard\\'s coming in, Dame Durden?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Richard is outside, is he, my dear?\" said I.\\n\\n\"I am not quite certain,\" returned Ada with a bashful simplicity that\\nwould have won my heart if she had not won it long before, \"but I\\nthink he\\'s waiting at the door.\"\\n\\nThere he was, of course. They brought a chair on either side of me,\\nand put me between them, and really seemed to have fallen in love\\nwith me instead of one another, they were so confiding, and so\\ntrustful, and so fond of me. They went on in their own wild way for a\\nlittle while--I never stopped them; I enjoyed it too much myself--and\\nthen we gradually fell to considering how young they were, and how\\nthere must be a lapse of several years before this early love could\\ncome to anything, and how it could come to happiness only if it were\\nreal and lasting and inspired them with a steady resolution to do\\ntheir duty to each other, with constancy, fortitude, and\\nperseverance, each always for the other\\'s sake. Well! Richard said\\nthat he would work his fingers to the bone for Ada, and Ada said that\\nshe would work her fingers to the bone for Richard, and they called\\nme all sorts of endearing and sensible names, and we sat there,\\nadvising and talking, half the night. Finally, before we parted, I\\ngave them my promise to speak to their cousin John to-morrow.\\n\\nSo, when to-morrow came, I went to my guardian after breakfast, in\\nthe room that was our town-substitute for the growlery, and told him\\nthat I had it in trust to tell him something.\\n\\n\"Well, little woman,\" said he, shutting up his book, \"if you have\\naccepted the trust, there can be no harm in it.\"\\n\\n\"I hope not, guardian,\" said I. \"I can guarantee that there is no\\nsecrecy in it. For it only happened yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"Aye? And what is it, Esther?\"\\n\\n\"Guardian,\" said I, \"you remember the happy night when first we came\\ndown to Bleak House? When Ada was singing in the dark room?\"\\n\\nI wished to call to his remembrance the look he had given me then.\\nUnless I am much mistaken, I saw that I did so.\\n\\n\"Because--\" said I with a little hesitation.\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear!\" said he. \"Don\\'t hurry.\"\\n\\n\"Because,\" said I, \"Ada and Richard have fallen in love. And have\\ntold each other so.\"\\n\\n\"Already!\" cried my guardian, quite astonished.\\n\\n\"Yes!\" said I. \"And to tell you the truth, guardian, I rather\\nexpected it.\"\\n\\n\"The deuce you did!\" said he.\\n\\nHe sat considering for a minute or two, with his smile, at once so\\nhandsome and so kind, upon his changing face, and then requested me\\nto let them know that he wished to see them. When they came, he\\nencircled Ada with one arm in his fatherly way and addressed himself\\nto Richard with a cheerful gravity.\\n\\n\"Rick,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"I am glad to have won your confidence. I\\nhope to preserve it. When I contemplated these relations between us\\nfour which have so brightened my life and so invested it with new\\ninterests and pleasures, I certainly did contemplate, afar off, the\\npossibility of you and your pretty cousin here (don\\'t be shy, Ada,\\ndon\\'t be shy, my dear!) being in a mind to go through life together.\\nI saw, and do see, many reasons to make it desirable. But that was\\nafar off, Rick, afar off!\"\\n\\n\"We look afar off, sir,\" returned Richard.\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"That\\'s rational. Now, hear me, my dears!\\nI might tell you that you don\\'t know your own minds yet, that a\\nthousand things may happen to divert you from one another, that it is\\nwell this chain of flowers you have taken up is very easily broken,\\nor it might become a chain of lead. But I will not do that. Such\\nwisdom will come soon enough, I dare say, if it is to come at all. I\\nwill assume that a few years hence you will be in your hearts to one\\nanother what you are to-day. All I say before speaking to you\\naccording to that assumption is, if you DO change--if you DO come to\\nfind that you are more commonplace cousins to each other as man and\\nwoman than you were as boy and girl (your manhood will excuse me,\\nRick!)--don\\'t be ashamed still to confide in me, for there will be\\nnothing monstrous or uncommon in it. I am only your friend and\\ndistant kinsman. I have no power over you whatever. But I wish and\\nhope to retain your confidence if I do nothing to forfeit it.\"\\n\\n\"I am very sure, sir,\" returned Richard, \"that I speak for Ada too\\nwhen I say that you have the strongest power over us both--rooted in\\nrespect, gratitude, and affection--strengthening every day.\"\\n\\n\"Dear cousin John,\" said Ada, on his shoulder, \"my father\\'s place can\\nnever be empty again. All the love and duty I could ever have\\nrendered to him is transferred to you.\"\\n\\n\"Come!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"Now for our assumption. Now we lift our\\neyes up and look hopefully at the distance! Rick, the world is before\\nyou; and it is most probable that as you enter it, so it will receive\\nyou. Trust in nothing but in Providence and your own efforts. Never\\nseparate the two, like the heathen waggoner. Constancy in love is a\\ngood thing, but it means nothing, and is nothing, without constancy\\nin every kind of effort. If you had the abilities of all the great\\nmen, past and present, you could do nothing well without sincerely\\nmeaning it and setting about it. If you entertain the supposition\\nthat any real success, in great things or in small, ever was or could\\nbe, ever will or can be, wrested from Fortune by fits and starts,\\nleave that wrong idea here or leave your cousin Ada here.\"\\n\\n\"I will leave IT here, sir,\" replied Richard smiling, \"if I brought\\nit here just now (but I hope I did not), and will work my way on to\\nmy cousin Ada in the hopeful distance.\"\\n\\n\"Right!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"If you are not to make her happy, why\\nshould you pursue her?\"\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t make her unhappy--no, not even for her love,\" retorted\\nRichard proudly.\\n\\n\"Well said!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce. \"That\\'s well said! She remains here,\\nin her home with me. Love her, Rick, in your active life, no less\\nthan in her home when you revisit it, and all will go well.\\nOtherwise, all will go ill. That\\'s the end of my preaching. I think\\nyou and Ada had better take a walk.\"\\n\\nAda tenderly embraced him, and Richard heartily shook hands with him,\\nand then the cousins went out of the room, looking back again\\ndirectly, though, to say that they would wait for me.\\n\\nThe door stood open, and we both followed them with our eyes as they\\npassed down the adjoining room, on which the sun was shining, and out\\nat its farther end. Richard with his head bent, and her hand drawn\\nthrough his arm, was talking to her very earnestly; and she looked up\\nin his face, listening, and seemed to see nothing else. So young, so\\nbeautiful, so full of hope and promise, they went on lightly through\\nthe sunlight as their own happy thoughts might then be traversing the\\nyears to come and making them all years of brightness. So they passed\\naway into the shadow and were gone. It was only a burst of light that\\nhad been so radiant. The room darkened as they went out, and the sun\\nwas clouded over.\\n\\n\"Am I right, Esther?\" said my guardian when they were gone.\\n\\nHe was so good and wise to ask ME whether he was right!\\n\\n\"Rick may gain, out of this, the quality he wants. Wants, at the core\\nof so much that is good!\" said Mr. Jarndyce, shaking his head. \"I\\nhave said nothing to Ada, Esther. She has her friend and counsellor\\nalways near.\" And he laid his hand lovingly upon my head.\\n\\nI could not help showing that I was a little moved, though I did all\\nI could to conceal it.\\n\\n\"Tut tut!\" said he. \"But we must take care, too, that our little\\nwoman\\'s life is not all consumed in care for others.\"\\n\\n\"Care? My dear guardian, I believe I am the happiest creature in the\\nworld!\"\\n\\n\"I believe so, too,\" said he. \"But some one may find out what Esther\\nnever will--that the little woman is to be held in remembrance above\\nall other people!\"\\n\\nI have omitted to mention in its place that there was some one else\\nat the family dinner party. It was not a lady. It was a gentleman. It\\nwas a gentleman of a dark complexion--a young surgeon. He was rather\\nreserved, but I thought him very sensible and agreeable. At least,\\nAda asked me if I did not, and I said yes.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'model_output': \"\\nA lawyer named Mr. Tulkinghorn visits the lodgings of a man who has died from an opium overdose. The landlord, Mr. Krook, found the body and summoned Mr. Tulkinghorn and a lodger named Miss Flite upstairs. A doctor examines the body and determines it was likely a suicide. The man was a poor law-writer who kept to himself. Mr. Tulkinghorn had come to offer him work before finding him dead. \\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn sends Miss Flite to fetch a law stationer named Mr. Snagsby, who knew the deceased man. Mr. Snagsby provides little useful information, only that the man had come to him over a year ago looking for copying work because he was impoverished. With no known relatives, it is decided the body will need to be buried by the parish.\\n\\nAfter an inquest, the man's body is taken to a foul graveyard and buried without ceremony, contrasting the barbarism that exists alongside civilization. A young boy named Jo who interacted with the man testifies at the inquest but provides little relevant information. The coroner concludes it was an accidental opium overdose.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Lady Dedlock and Sir Leicester return by carriage from Paris to Chesney Wold. Lady Dedlock is bored and wants to get away from Paris quickly. At Chesney Wold, she notices a pretty young scholar named Rosa who catches her attention briefly. Lady Dedlock's French maid Hortense resents Rosa for this. Mr. Tulkinghorn relays a message to Lady Dedlock about the dead law-writer who had copied the affidavit she inquired about earlier, though the specifics of Lady Dedlock's reaction are not mentioned. Many guests visit Chesney Wold but Mr. Tulkinghorn's room stays empty as he comes and goes quietly. Lady Dedlock asks him about the man's death. Mr. Tulkinghorn reveals the man lived wretchedly and died by his own hand potentially.\\n\\nElsewhere, Richard decides to become a doctor but is advised by Mr. Jarndyce to carefully consider his natural talents when choosing a profession, rather than jumping from one thing to another. Mr. Boythorn passionately criticizes the mistreatment of surgeons. Richard studies under Mr. Bayham Badger and is followed persistently by Mr. Guppy, making his friend Esther uneasy, though her specific concerns are not mentioned. \\n\\nEsther tells Mr. Jarndyce that Ada and Richard have confessed their love. Mr. Jarndyce cautions they are young but gives them his blessing, asking only that they be honest if they change their minds. Ada and Richard happily agree. Mr. Jarndyce tells Esther he hopes she helps Ada and that Esther's life is more than caring for others.\\n\"}, {'summary': 'Richard leaves to start his studies. He is hopeful about a career as a surgeon, but continues to hope to inherit a fortune through the Jarndyce suit. Esther and Jarndyce find this troubling.\\n\\nEsther and the others go to visit the Jellyby household, and see Caddy and Peepy. Peepy is in a disheveled state, as usual, but Caddy has endeavored to make her appearance somewhat better, and looks very pretty. She tells them good and bad news.\\n\\nShe is engaged to young Mr. Prince Turveydrop, the son of the dancing master Mr. Turveydrop. The old man is a \"model of deportment\" but makes his son do all the work in the dancing school. Also, Mr. Jellyby is on the brink of bankruptcy.\\n\\nThe party continues to Miss Flite, who is being attended professionally by Dr. Woodcourt. She has quite recovered, and talks merrily about her good fortune in being forwarded seven shillings a week from some mysterious source through Kenge and Carboy\\'s. The source is not revealed, but Mr. Jarndyce, Esther notes, is staring intently at Miss Flite\\'s birds (named allegorically: Hope, Faith, Jargon, Documents, Sheepskin, etc.) during this interlude, and Esther draws her own conclusions. Caddy Jellyby and Miss Flite have become friends, and Caddy helps Miss Flite to use her newfound money to best advantage.\\n\\nMr. Krook intrudes, and shares that he has been attempting to learn to read. Allan Woodcourt, who is also Mr. Krook\\'s doctor, converses with the company, is invited to dinner, and becomes friends with Esther, Ada, and Richard.\\n\\nIn Chapter 15, Mr. Skimpole reveals that Mr. Neckett of Coavinses has died, leaving three destitute children. The party goes to visit them, and meets Charley (about 13), Tom (5 or 6) and Emma (18 months). The two younger children are locked in while Charley, whoses real name is Charlotte, goes out to work each day for some money. Charley is hardworking and tries hard to be a good mother to her younger siblings. The lodgers in the house (Mrs. Blinder, Mr. Gridley) help out with the children also, but their situation is desperate.\\n\\nMr. Gridley (the Man from Shropshire from Chapter 1) reveals that he is also embroiled in a Chancery suit which has ruined his life. He should have inherited money but the Chancery delay has consumed it. He and Jarndyce agree on the evils of Chancery.\\n\\nIn Chapter 16, Sir Leicester is afflicted with gout, and laying in sickbed at Chesney Wold. He considers it a privilege to have such an aristocratic disease, which all of his lineage have also had. He waits in the country looking at a picture of his lady.\\n\\nLady Dedlock, meanwhile, goes to their house in London and secretly leaves it dressed in servant\\'s dress, veiled.

She is horrified, gives Jo a gold coin, and disappears.', 'text': 'Richard left us on the very next evening to begin his new career, and\\ncommitted Ada to my charge with great love for her and great trust in\\nme. It touched me then to reflect, and it touches me now, more\\nnearly, to remember (having what I have to tell) how they both\\nthought of me, even at that engrossing time. I was a part of all\\ntheir plans, for the present and the future. I was to write Richard\\nonce a week, making my faithful report of Ada, who was to write to\\nhim every alternate day. I was to be informed, under his own hand, of\\nall his labours and successes; I was to observe how resolute and\\npersevering he would be; I was to be Ada\\'s bridesmaid when they were\\nmarried; I was to live with them afterwards; I was to keep all the\\nkeys of their house; I was to be made happy for ever and a day.\\n\\n\"And if the suit SHOULD make us rich, Esther--which it may, you\\nknow!\" said Richard to crown all.\\n\\nA shade crossed Ada\\'s face.\\n\\n\"My dearest Ada,\" asked Richard, \"why not?\"\\n\\n\"It had better declare us poor at once,\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"Oh! I don\\'t know about that,\" returned Richard, \"but at all events,\\nit won\\'t declare anything at once. It hasn\\'t declared anything in\\nheaven knows how many years.\"\\n\\n\"Too true,\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"Yes, but,\" urged Richard, answering what her look suggested rather\\nthan her words, \"the longer it goes on, dear cousin, the nearer it\\nmust be to a settlement one way or other. Now, is not that\\nreasonable?\"\\n\\n\"You know best, Richard. But I am afraid if we trust to it, it will\\nmake us unhappy.\"\\n\\n\"But, my Ada, we are not going to trust to it!\" cried Richard gaily.\\n\"We know it better than to trust to it. We only say that if it SHOULD\\nmake us rich, we have no constitutional objection to being rich. The\\ncourt is, by solemn settlement of law, our grim old guardian, and we\\nare to suppose that what it gives us (when it gives us anything) is\\nour right. It is not necessary to quarrel with our right.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ada, \"but it may be better to forget all about it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well,\" cried Richard, \"then we will forget all about it! We\\nconsign the whole thing to oblivion. Dame Durden puts on her\\napproving face, and it\\'s done!\"\\n\\n\"Dame Durden\\'s approving face,\" said I, looking out of the box in\\nwhich I was packing his books, \"was not very visible when you called\\nit by that name; but it does approve, and she thinks you can\\'t do\\nbetter.\"\\n\\nSo, Richard said there was an end of it, and immediately began, on no\\nother foundation, to build as many castles in the air as would man\\nthe Great Wall of China. He went away in high spirits. Ada and I,\\nprepared to miss him very much, commenced our quieter career.\\n\\nOn our arrival in London, we had called with Mr. Jarndyce at Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s but had not been so fortunate as to find her at home. It\\nappeared that she had gone somewhere to a tea-drinking and had taken\\nMiss Jellyby with her. Besides the tea-drinking, there was to be some\\nconsiderable speech-making and letter-writing on the general merits\\nof the cultivation of coffee, conjointly with natives, at the\\nSettlement of Borrioboola-Gha. All this involved, no doubt,\\nsufficient active exercise of pen and ink to make her daughter\\'s part\\nin the proceedings anything but a holiday.\\n\\nIt being now beyond the time appointed for Mrs. Jellyby\\'s return, we\\ncalled again. She was in town, but not at home, having gone to Mile\\nEnd directly after breakfast on some Borrioboolan business, arising\\nout of a society called the East London Branch Aid Ramification. As I\\nhad not seen Peepy on the occasion of our last call (when he was not\\nto be found anywhere, and when the cook rather thought he must have\\nstrolled away with the dustman\\'s cart), I now inquired for him again.\\nThe oyster shells he had been building a house with were still in the\\npassage, but he was nowhere discoverable, and the cook supposed that\\nhe had \"gone after the sheep.\" When we repeated, with some surprise,\\n\"The sheep?\" she said, Oh, yes, on market days he sometimes followed\\nthem quite out of town and came back in such a state as never was!\\n\\nI was sitting at the window with my guardian on the following\\nmorning, and Ada was busy writing--of course to Richard--when Miss\\nJellyby was announced, and entered, leading the identical Peepy, whom\\nshe had made some endeavours to render presentable by wiping the dirt\\ninto corners of his face and hands and making his hair very wet and\\nthen violently frizzling it with her fingers. Everything the dear\\nchild wore was either too large for him or too small. Among his other\\ncontradictory decorations he had the hat of a bishop and the little\\ngloves of a baby. His boots were, on a small scale, the boots of a\\nploughman, while his legs, so crossed and recrossed with scratches\\nthat they looked like maps, were bare below a very short pair of\\nplaid drawers finished off with two frills of perfectly different\\npatterns. The deficient buttons on his plaid frock had evidently been\\nsupplied from one of Mr. Jellyby\\'s coats, they were so extremely\\nbrazen and so much too large. Most extraordinary specimens of\\nneedlework appeared on several parts of his dress, where it had been\\nhastily mended, and I recognized the same hand on Miss Jellyby\\'s. She\\nwas, however, unaccountably improved in her appearance and looked\\nvery pretty. She was conscious of poor little Peepy being but a\\nfailure after all her trouble, and she showed it as she came in by\\nthe way in which she glanced first at him and then at us.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear me!\" said my guardian. \"Due east!\"\\n\\nAda and I gave her a cordial welcome and presented her to Mr.\\nJarndyce, to whom she said as she sat down, \"Ma\\'s compliments, and\\nshe hopes you\\'ll excuse her, because she\\'s correcting proofs of the\\nplan. She\\'s going to put out five thousand new circulars, and she\\nknows you\\'ll be interested to hear that. I have brought one of them\\nwith me. Ma\\'s compliments.\" With which she presented it sulkily\\nenough.\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said my guardian. \"I am much obliged to Mrs. Jellyby.\\nOh, dear me! This is a very trying wind!\"\\n\\nWe were busy with Peepy, taking off his clerical hat, asking him if\\nhe remembered us, and so on. Peepy retired behind his elbow at first,\\nbut relented at the sight of sponge-cake and allowed me to take him\\non my lap, where he sat munching quietly. Mr. Jarndyce then\\nwithdrawing into the temporary growlery, Miss Jellyby opened a\\nconversation with her usual abruptness.\\n\\n\"We are going on just as bad as ever in Thavies Inn,\" said she. \"I\\nhave no peace of my life. Talk of Africa! I couldn\\'t be worse off if\\nI was a what\\'s-his-name--man and a brother!\"\\n\\nI tried to say something soothing.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s of no use, Miss Summerson,\" exclaimed Miss Jellyby, \"though\\nI thank you for the kind intention all the same. I know how I am\\nused, and I am not to be talked over. YOU wouldn\\'t be talked over if\\nyou were used so. Peepy, go and play at Wild Beasts under the piano!\"\\n\\n\"I shan\\'t!\" said Peepy.\\n\\n\"Very well, you ungrateful, naughty, hard-hearted boy!\" returned Miss\\nJellyby with tears in her eyes. \"I\\'ll never take pains to dress you\\nany more.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I will go, Caddy!\" cried Peepy, who was really a good child and\\nwho was so moved by his sister\\'s vexation that he went at once.\\n\\n\"It seems a little thing to cry about,\" said poor Miss Jellyby\\napologetically, \"but I am quite worn out. I was directing the new\\ncirculars till two this morning. I detest the whole thing so that\\nthat alone makes my head ache till I can\\'t see out of my eyes. And\\nlook at that poor unfortunate child! Was there ever such a fright as\\nhe is!\"\\n\\nPeepy, happily unconscious of the defects in his appearance, sat on\\nthe carpet behind one of the legs of the piano, looking calmly out of\\nhis den at us while he ate his cake.\\n\\n\"I have sent him to the other end of the room,\" observed Miss\\nJellyby, drawing her chair nearer ours, \"because I don\\'t want him to\\nhear the conversation. Those little things are so sharp! I was going\\nto say, we really are going on worse than ever. Pa will be a bankrupt\\nbefore long, and then I hope Ma will be satisfied. There\\'ll he nobody\\nbut Ma to thank for it.\"\\n\\nWe said we hoped Mr. Jellyby\\'s affairs were not in so bad a state as\\nthat.\\n\\n\"It\\'s of no use hoping, though it\\'s very kind of you,\" returned Miss\\nJellyby, shaking her head. \"Pa told me only yesterday morning (and\\ndreadfully unhappy he is) that he couldn\\'t weather the storm. I\\nshould be surprised if he could. When all our tradesmen send into our\\nhouse any stuff they like, and the servants do what they like with\\nit, and I have no time to improve things if I knew how, and Ma don\\'t\\ncare about anything, I should like to make out how Pa is to weather\\nthe storm. I declare if I was Pa, I\\'d run away.\"\\n\\n\"My dear!\" said I, smiling. \"Your papa, no doubt, considers his\\nfamily.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, his family is all very fine, Miss Summerson,\" replied Miss\\nJellyby; \"but what comfort is his family to him? His family is\\nnothing but bills, dirt, waste, noise, tumbles downstairs, confusion,\\nand wretchedness. His scrambling home, from week\\'s end to week\\'s end,\\nis like one great washing-day--only nothing\\'s washed!\"\\n\\nMiss Jellyby tapped her foot upon the floor and wiped her eyes.\\n\\n\"I am sure I pity Pa to that degree,\" she said, \"and am so angry with\\nMa that I can\\'t find words to express myself! However, I am not going\\nto bear it, I am determined. I won\\'t be a slave all my life, and I\\nwon\\'t submit to be proposed to by Mr. Quale. A pretty thing, indeed,\\nto marry a philanthropist. As if I hadn\\'t had enough of THAT!\" said\\npoor Miss Jellyby.\\n\\nI must confess that I could not help feeling rather angry with Mrs.\\nJellyby myself, seeing and hearing this neglected girl and knowing\\nhow much of bitterly satirical truth there was in what she said.\\n\\n\"If it wasn\\'t that we had been intimate when you stopped at our\\nhouse,\" pursued Miss Jellyby, \"I should have been ashamed to come\\nhere to-day, for I know what a figure I must seem to you two. But as\\nit is, I made up my mind to call, especially as I am not likely to\\nsee you again the next time you come to town.\"\\n\\nShe said this with such great significance that Ada and I glanced at\\none another, foreseeing something more.\\n\\n\"No!\" said Miss Jellyby, shaking her head. \"Not at all likely! I know\\nI may trust you two. I am sure you won\\'t betray me. I am engaged.\"\\n\\n\"Without their knowledge at home?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Why, good gracious me, Miss Summerson,\" she returned, justifying\\nherself in a fretful but not angry manner, \"how can it be otherwise?\\nYou know what Ma is--and I needn\\'t make poor Pa more miserable by\\ntelling HIM.\"\\n\\n\"But would it not be adding to his unhappiness to marry without his\\nknowledge or consent, my dear?\" said I.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Miss Jellyby, softening. \"I hope not. I should try to make\\nhim happy and comfortable when he came to see me, and Peepy and the\\nothers should take it in turns to come and stay with me, and they\\nshould have some care taken of them then.\"\\n\\nThere was a good deal of affection in poor Caddy. She softened more\\nand more while saying this and cried so much over the unwonted little\\nhome-picture she had raised in her mind that Peepy, in his cave under\\nthe piano, was touched, and turned himself over on his back with loud\\nlamentations. It was not until I had brought him to kiss his sister,\\nand had restored him to his place on my lap, and had shown him that\\nCaddy was laughing (she laughed expressly for the purpose), that we\\ncould recall his peace of mind; even then it was for some time\\nconditional on his taking us in turns by the chin and smoothing our\\nfaces all over with his hand. At last, as his spirits were not equal\\nto the piano, we put him on a chair to look out of window; and Miss\\nJellyby, holding him by one leg, resumed her confidence.\\n\\n\"It began in your coming to our house,\" she said.\\n\\nWe naturally asked how.\\n\\n\"I felt I was so awkward,\" she replied, \"that I made up my mind to be\\nimproved in that respect at all events and to learn to dance. I told\\nMa I was ashamed of myself, and I must be taught to dance. Ma looked\\nat me in that provoking way of hers as if I wasn\\'t in sight, but I\\nwas quite determined to be taught to dance, and so I went to Mr.\\nTurveydrop\\'s Academy in Newman Street.\"\\n\\n\"And was it there, my dear--\" I began.\\n\\n\"Yes, it was there,\" said Caddy, \"and I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop.\\nThere are two Mr. Turveydrops, father and son. My Mr. Turveydrop is\\nthe son, of course. I only wish I had been better brought up and was\\nlikely to make him a better wife, for I am very fond of him.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry to hear this,\" said I, \"I must confess.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know why you should be sorry,\" she retorted a little\\nanxiously, \"but I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop, whether or no, and he\\nis very fond of me. It\\'s a secret as yet, even on his side, because\\nold Mr. Turveydrop has a share in the connexion and it might break\\nhis heart or give him some other shock if he was told of it abruptly.\\nOld Mr. Turveydrop is a very gentlemanly man indeed--very\\ngentlemanly.\"\\n\\n\"Does his wife know of it?\" asked Ada.\\n\\n\"Old Mr. Turveydrop\\'s wife, Miss Clare?\" returned Miss Jellyby,\\nopening her eyes. \"There\\'s no such person. He is a widower.\"\\n\\nWe were here interrupted by Peepy, whose leg had undergone so much on\\naccount of his sister\\'s unconsciously jerking it like a bell-rope\\nwhenever she was emphatic that the afflicted child now bemoaned his\\nsufferings with a very low-spirited noise. As he appealed to me for\\ncompassion, and as I was only a listener, I undertook to hold him.\\nMiss Jellyby proceeded, after begging Peepy\\'s pardon with a kiss and\\nassuring him that she hadn\\'t meant to do it.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the state of the case,\" said Caddy. \"If I ever blame myself,\\nI still think it\\'s Ma\\'s fault. We are to be married whenever we can,\\nand then I shall go to Pa at the office and write to Ma. It won\\'t\\nmuch agitate Ma; I am only pen and ink to HER. One great comfort is,\"\\nsaid Caddy with a sob, \"that I shall never hear of Africa after I am\\nmarried. Young Mr. Turveydrop hates it for my sake, and if old Mr.\\nTurveydrop knows there is such a place, it\\'s as much as he does.\"\\n\\n\"It was he who was very gentlemanly, I think!\" said I.\\n\\n\"Very gentlemanly indeed,\" said Caddy. \"He is celebrated almost\\neverywhere for his deportment.\"\\n\\n\"Does he teach?\" asked Ada.\\n\\n\"No, he don\\'t teach anything in particular,\" replied Caddy. \"But his\\ndeportment is beautiful.\"\\n\\nCaddy went on to say with considerable hesitation and reluctance that\\nthere was one thing more she wished us to know, and felt we ought to\\nknow, and which she hoped would not offend us. It was that she had\\nimproved her acquaintance with Miss Flite, the little crazy old lady,\\nand that she frequently went there early in the morning and met her\\nlover for a few minutes before breakfast--only for a few minutes. \"I\\ngo there at other times,\" said Caddy, \"but Prince does not come then.\\nYoung Mr. Turveydrop\\'s name is Prince; I wish it wasn\\'t, because it\\nsounds like a dog, but of course he didn\\'t christen himself. Old Mr.\\nTurveydrop had him christened Prince in remembrance of the Prince\\nRegent. Old Mr. Turveydrop adored the Prince Regent on account of his\\ndeportment. I hope you won\\'t think the worse of me for having made\\nthese little appointments at Miss Flite\\'s, where I first went with\\nyou, because I like the poor thing for her own sake and I believe she\\nlikes me. If you could see young Mr. Turveydrop, I am sure you would\\nthink well of him--at least, I am sure you couldn\\'t possibly think\\nany ill of him. I am going there now for my lesson. I couldn\\'t ask\\nyou to go with me, Miss Summerson; but if you would,\" said Caddy, who\\nhad said all this earnestly and tremblingly, \"I should be very\\nglad--very glad.\"\\n\\nIt happened that we had arranged with my guardian to go to Miss\\nFlite\\'s that day. We had told him of our former visit, and our\\naccount had interested him; but something had always happened to\\nprevent our going there again. As I trusted that I might have\\nsufficient influence with Miss Jellyby to prevent her taking any very\\nrash step if I fully accepted the confidence she was so willing to\\nplace in me, poor girl, I proposed that she and I and Peepy should go\\nto the academy and afterwards meet my guardian and Ada at Miss\\nFlite\\'s, whose name I now learnt for the first time. This was on\\ncondition that Miss Jellyby and Peepy should come back with us to\\ndinner. The last article of the agreement being joyfully acceded to\\nby both, we smartened Peepy up a little with the assistance of a few\\npins, some soap and water, and a hair-brush, and went out, bending\\nour steps towards Newman Street, which was very near.\\n\\nI found the academy established in a sufficiently dingy house at the\\ncorner of an archway, with busts in all the staircase windows. In the\\nsame house there were also established, as I gathered from the plates\\non the door, a drawing-master, a coal-merchant (there was, certainly,\\nno room for his coals), and a lithographic artist. On the plate\\nwhich, in size and situation, took precedence of all the rest, I\\nread, MR. TURVEYDROP. The door was open, and the hall was blocked up\\nby a grand piano, a harp, and several other musical instruments in\\ncases, all in progress of removal, and all looking rakish in the\\ndaylight. Miss Jellyby informed me that the academy had been lent,\\nlast night, for a concert.\\n\\nWe went upstairs--it had been quite a fine house once, when it was\\nanybody\\'s business to keep it clean and fresh, and nobody\\'s business\\nto smoke in it all day--and into Mr. Turveydrop\\'s great room, which\\nwas built out into a mews at the back and was lighted by a skylight.\\nIt was a bare, resounding room smelling of stables, with cane forms\\nalong the walls, and the walls ornamented at regular intervals with\\npainted lyres and little cut-glass branches for candles, which seemed\\nto be shedding their old-fashioned drops as other branches might shed\\nautumn leaves. Several young lady pupils, ranging from thirteen or\\nfourteen years of age to two or three and twenty, were assembled; and\\nI was looking among them for their instructor when Caddy, pinching my\\narm, repeated the ceremony of introduction. \"Miss Summerson, Mr.\\nPrince Turveydrop!\"\\n\\nI curtsied to a little blue-eyed fair man of youthful appearance with\\nflaxen hair parted in the middle and curling at the ends all round\\nhis head. He had a little fiddle, which we used to call at school a\\nkit, under his left arm, and its little bow in the same hand. His\\nlittle dancing-shoes were particularly diminutive, and he had a\\nlittle innocent, feminine manner which not only appealed to me in an\\namiable way, but made this singular effect upon me, that I received\\nthe impression that he was like his mother and that his mother had\\nnot been much considered or well used.\\n\\n\"I am very happy to see Miss Jellyby\\'s friend,\" he said, bowing low\\nto me. \"I began to fear,\" with timid tenderness, \"as it was past the\\nusual time, that Miss Jellyby was not coming.\"\\n\\n\"I beg you will have the goodness to attribute that to me, who have\\ndetained her, and to receive my excuses, sir,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear!\" said he.\\n\\n\"And pray,\" I entreated, \"do not allow me to be the cause of any more\\ndelay.\"\\n\\nWith that apology I withdrew to a seat between Peepy (who, being well\\nused to it, had already climbed into a corner place) and an old lady\\nof a censorious countenance whose two nieces were in the class and\\nwho was very indignant with Peepy\\'s boots. Prince Turveydrop then\\ntinkled the strings of his kit with his fingers, and the young ladies\\nstood up to dance. Just then there appeared from a side-door old Mr.\\nTurveydrop, in the full lustre of his deportment.\\n\\nHe was a fat old gentleman with a false complexion, false teeth,\\nfalse whiskers, and a wig. He had a fur collar, and he had a padded\\nbreast to his coat, which only wanted a star or a broad blue ribbon\\nto be complete. He was pinched in, and swelled out, and got up, and\\nstrapped down, as much as he could possibly bear. He had such a\\nneckcloth on (puffing his very eyes out of their natural shape), and\\nhis chin and even his ears so sunk into it, that it seemed as though\\nhe must inevitably double up if it were cast loose. He had under his\\narm a hat of great size and weight, shelving downward from the crown\\nto the brim, and in his hand a pair of white gloves with which he\\nflapped it as he stood poised on one leg in a high-shouldered,\\nround-elbowed state of elegance not to be surpassed. He had a cane,\\nhe had an eye-glass, he had a snuff-box, he had rings, he had\\nwristbands, he had everything but any touch of nature; he was not\\nlike youth, he was not like age, he was not like anything in the\\nworld but a model of deportment.\\n\\n\"Father! A visitor. Miss Jellyby\\'s friend, Miss Summerson.\"\\n\\n\"Distinguished,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"by Miss Summerson\\'s presence.\"\\nAs he bowed to me in that tight state, I almost believe I saw creases\\ncome into the whites of his eyes.\\n\\n\"My father,\" said the son, aside, to me with quite an affecting\\nbelief in him, \"is a celebrated character. My father is greatly\\nadmired.\"\\n\\n\"Go on, Prince! Go on!\" said Mr. Turveydrop, standing with his back\\nto the fire and waving his gloves condescendingly. \"Go on, my son!\"\\n\\nAt this command, or by this gracious permission, the lesson went on.\\nPrince Turveydrop sometimes played the kit, dancing; sometimes played\\nthe piano, standing; sometimes hummed the tune with what little\\nbreath he could spare, while he set a pupil right; always\\nconscientiously moved with the least proficient through every step\\nand every part of the figure; and never rested for an instant. His\\ndistinguished father did nothing whatever but stand before the fire,\\na model of deportment.\\n\\n\"And he never does anything else,\" said the old lady of the\\ncensorious countenance. \"Yet would you believe that it\\'s HIS name on\\nthe door-plate?\"\\n\\n\"His son\\'s name is the same, you know,\" said I.\\n\\n\"He wouldn\\'t let his son have any name if he could take it from him,\"\\nreturned the old lady. \"Look at the son\\'s dress!\" It certainly was\\nplain--threadbare--almost shabby. \"Yet the father must be garnished\\nand tricked out,\" said the old lady, \"because of his deportment. I\\'d\\ndeport him! Transport him would be better!\"\\n\\nI felt curious to know more concerning this person. I asked, \"Does he\\ngive lessons in deportment now?\"\\n\\n\"Now!\" returned the old lady shortly. \"Never did.\"\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s consideration, I suggested that perhaps fencing had\\nbeen his accomplishment.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe he can fence at all, ma\\'am,\" said the old lady.\\n\\nI looked surprised and inquisitive. The old lady, becoming more and\\nmore incensed against the master of deportment as she dwelt upon the\\nsubject, gave me some particulars of his career, with strong\\nassurances that they were mildly stated.\\n\\nHe had married a meek little dancing-mistress, with a tolerable\\nconnexion (having never in his life before done anything but deport\\nhimself), and had worked her to death, or had, at the best, suffered\\nher to work herself to death, to maintain him in those expenses which\\nwere indispensable to his position. At once to exhibit his deportment\\nto the best models and to keep the best models constantly before\\nhimself, he had found it necessary to frequent all public places of\\nfashionable and lounging resort, to be seen at Brighton and elsewhere\\nat fashionable times, and to lead an idle life in the very best\\nclothes. To enable him to do this, the affectionate little\\ndancing-mistress had toiled and laboured and would have toiled and\\nlaboured to that hour if her strength had lasted so long. For the\\nmainspring of the story was that in spite of the man\\'s absorbing\\nselfishness, his wife (overpowered by his deportment) had, to the\\nlast, believed in him and had, on her death-bed, in the most moving\\nterms, confided him to their son as one who had an inextinguishable\\nclaim upon him and whom he could never regard with too much pride and\\ndeference. The son, inheriting his mother\\'s belief, and having the\\ndeportment always before him, had lived and grown in the same faith,\\nand now, at thirty years of age, worked for his father twelve hours a\\nday and looked up to him with veneration on the old imaginary\\npinnacle.\\n\\n\"The airs the fellow gives himself!\" said my informant, shaking her\\nhead at old Mr. Turveydrop with speechless indignation as he drew on\\nhis tight gloves, of course unconscious of the homage she was\\nrendering. \"He fully believes he is one of the aristocracy! And he is\\nso condescending to the son he so egregiously deludes that you might\\nsuppose him the most virtuous of parents. Oh!\" said the old lady,\\napostrophizing him with infinite vehemence. \"I could bite you!\"\\n\\nI could not help being amused, though I heard the old lady out with\\nfeelings of real concern. It was difficult to doubt her with the\\nfather and son before me. What I might have thought of them without\\nthe old lady\\'s account, or what I might have thought of the old\\nlady\\'s account without them, I cannot say. There was a fitness of\\nthings in the whole that carried conviction with it.\\n\\nMy eyes were yet wandering, from young Mr. Turveydrop working so\\nhard, to old Mr. Turveydrop deporting himself so beautifully, when\\nthe latter came ambling up to me and entered into conversation.\\n\\nHe asked me, first of all, whether I conferred a charm and a\\ndistinction on London by residing in it? I did not think it necessary\\nto reply that I was perfectly aware I should not do that, in any\\ncase, but merely told him where I did reside.\\n\\n\"A lady so graceful and accomplished,\" he said, kissing his\\nright glove and afterwards extending it towards the pupils,\\n\"will look leniently on the deficiencies here. We do our best to\\npolish--polish--polish!\"\\n\\nHe sat down beside me, taking some pains to sit on the form, I\\nthought, in imitation of the print of his illustrious model on the\\nsofa. And really he did look very like it.\\n\\n\"To polish--polish--polish!\" he repeated, taking a pinch of snuff and\\ngently fluttering his fingers. \"But we are not, if I may say so to\\none formed to be graceful both by Nature and Art--\" with the\\nhigh-shouldered bow, which it seemed impossible for him to make\\nwithout lifting up his eyebrows and shutting his eyes \"--we are not\\nwhat we used to be in point of deportment.\"\\n\\n\"Are we not, sir?\" said I.\\n\\n\"We have degenerated,\" he returned, shaking his head, which he could\\ndo to a very limited extent in his cravat. \"A levelling age is not\\nfavourable to deportment. It develops vulgarity. Perhaps I speak with\\nsome little partiality. It may not be for me to say that I have been\\ncalled, for some years now, Gentleman Turveydrop, or that his Royal\\nHighness the Prince Regent did me the honour to inquire, on my\\nremoving my hat as he drove out of the Pavilion at Brighton (that\\nfine building), \\'Who is he? Who the devil is he? Why don\\'t I know\\nhim? Why hasn\\'t he thirty thousand a year?\\' But these are little\\nmatters of anecdote--the general property, ma\\'am--still repeated\\noccasionally among the upper classes.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed?\" said I.\\n\\nHe replied with the high-shouldered bow. \"Where what is left among us\\nof deportment,\" he added, \"still lingers. England--alas, my\\ncountry!--has degenerated very much, and is degenerating every day.\\nShe has not many gentlemen left. We are few. I see nothing to succeed\\nus but a race of weavers.\"\\n\\n\"One might hope that the race of gentlemen would be perpetuated\\nhere,\" said I.\\n\\n\"You are very good.\" He smiled with a high-shouldered bow again. \"You\\nflatter me. But, no--no! I have never been able to imbue my poor boy\\nwith that part of his art. Heaven forbid that I should disparage my\\ndear child, but he has--no deportment.\"\\n\\n\"He appears to be an excellent master,\" I observed.\\n\\n\"Understand me, my dear madam, he IS an excellent master. All that\\ncan be acquired, he has acquired. All that can be imparted, he can\\nimpart. But there ARE things--\" He took another pinch of snuff and\\nmade the bow again, as if to add, \"This kind of thing, for instance.\"\\n\\nI glanced towards the centre of the room, where Miss Jellyby\\'s lover,\\nnow engaged with single pupils, was undergoing greater drudgery than\\never.\\n\\n\"My amiable child,\" murmured Mr. Turveydrop, adjusting his cravat.\\n\\n\"Your son is indefatigable,\" said I.\\n\\n\"It is my reward,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"to hear you say so. In some\\nrespects, he treads in the footsteps of his sainted mother. She was a\\ndevoted creature. But wooman, lovely wooman,\" said Mr. Turveydrop\\nwith very disagreeable gallantry, \"what a sex you are!\"\\n\\nI rose and joined Miss Jellyby, who was by this time putting on her\\nbonnet. The time allotted to a lesson having fully elapsed, there was\\na general putting on of bonnets. When Miss Jellyby and the\\nunfortunate Prince found an opportunity to become betrothed I don\\'t\\nknow, but they certainly found none on this occasion to exchange a\\ndozen words.\\n\\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Turveydrop benignly to his son, \"do you know the\\nhour?\"\\n\\n\"No, father.\" The son had no watch. The father had a handsome gold\\none, which he pulled out with an air that was an example to mankind.\\n\\n\"My son,\" said he, \"it\\'s two o\\'clock. Recollect your school at\\nKensington at three.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s time enough for me, father,\" said Prince. \"I can take a\\nmorsel of dinner standing and be off.\"\\n\\n\"My dear boy,\" returned his father, \"you must be very quick. You will\\nfind the cold mutton on the table.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, father. Are YOU off now, father?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear. I suppose,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, shutting his eyes and\\nlifting up his shoulders with modest consciousness, \"that I must show\\nmyself, as usual, about town.\"\\n\\n\"You had better dine out comfortably somewhere,\" said his son.\\n\\n\"My dear child, I intend to. I shall take my little meal, I think, at\\nthe French house, in the Opera Colonnade.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right. Good-bye, father!\" said Prince, shaking hands.\\n\\n\"Good-bye, my son. Bless you!\"\\n\\nMr. Turveydrop said this in quite a pious manner, and it seemed to do\\nhis son good, who, in parting from him, was so pleased with him, so\\ndutiful to him, and so proud of him that I almost felt as if it were\\nan unkindness to the younger man not to be able to believe implicitly\\nin the elder. The few moments that were occupied by Prince in taking\\nleave of us (and particularly of one of us, as I saw, being in the\\nsecret), enhanced my favourable impression of his almost childish\\ncharacter. I felt a liking for him and a compassion for him as he put\\nhis little kit in his pocket--and with it his desire to stay a little\\nwhile with Caddy--and went away good-humouredly to his cold mutton\\nand his school at Kensington, that made me scarcely less irate with\\nhis father than the censorious old lady.\\n\\nThe father opened the room door for us and bowed us out in a manner,\\nI must acknowledge, worthy of his shining original. In the same style\\nhe presently passed us on the other side of the street, on his way to\\nthe aristocratic part of the town, where he was going to show himself\\namong the few other gentlemen left. For some moments, I was so lost\\nin reconsidering what I had heard and seen in Newman Street that I\\nwas quite unable to talk to Caddy or even to fix my attention on what\\nshe said to me, especially when I began to inquire in my mind whether\\nthere were, or ever had been, any other gentlemen, not in the dancing\\nprofession, who lived and founded a reputation entirely on their\\ndeportment. This became so bewildering and suggested the possibility\\nof so many Mr. Turveydrops that I said, \"Esther, you must make up\\nyour mind to abandon this subject altogether and attend to Caddy.\" I\\naccordingly did so, and we chatted all the rest of the way to\\nLincoln\\'s Inn.\\n\\nCaddy told me that her lover\\'s education had been so neglected that\\nit was not always easy to read his notes. She said if he were not so\\nanxious about his spelling and took less pains to make it clear, he\\nwould do better; but he put so many unnecessary letters into short\\nwords that they sometimes quite lost their English appearance. \"He\\ndoes it with the best intention,\" observed Caddy, \"but it hasn\\'t the\\neffect he means, poor fellow!\" Caddy then went on to reason, how\\ncould he be expected to be a scholar when he had passed his whole\\nlife in the dancing-school and had done nothing but teach and fag,\\nfag and teach, morning, noon, and night! And what did it matter? She\\ncould write letters enough for both, as she knew to her cost, and it\\nwas far better for him to be amiable than learned. \"Besides, it\\'s not\\nas if I was an accomplished girl who had any right to give herself\\nairs,\" said Caddy. \"I know little enough, I am sure, thanks to Ma!\\n\\n\"There\\'s another thing I want to tell you, now we are alone,\"\\ncontinued Caddy, \"which I should not have liked to mention unless you\\nhad seen Prince, Miss Summerson. You know what a house ours is. It\\'s\\nof no use my trying to learn anything that it would be useful for\\nPrince\\'s wife to know in OUR house. We live in such a state of muddle\\nthat it\\'s impossible, and I have only been more disheartened whenever\\nI have tried. So I get a little practice with--who do you think? Poor\\nMiss Flite! Early in the morning I help her to tidy her room and\\nclean her birds, and I make her cup of coffee for her (of course she\\ntaught me), and I have learnt to make it so well that Prince says\\nit\\'s the very best coffee he ever tasted, and would quite delight old\\nMr. Turveydrop, who is very particular indeed about his coffee. I can\\nmake little puddings too; and I know how to buy neck of mutton, and\\ntea, and sugar, and butter, and a good many housekeeping things. I am\\nnot clever at my needle, yet,\" said Caddy, glancing at the repairs on\\nPeepy\\'s frock, \"but perhaps I shall improve, and since I have been\\nengaged to Prince and have been doing all this, I have felt\\nbetter-tempered, I hope, and more forgiving to Ma. It rather put me\\nout at first this morning to see you and Miss Clare looking so neat\\nand pretty and to feel ashamed of Peepy and myself too, but on the\\nwhole I hope I am better-tempered than I was and more forgiving to\\nMa.\"\\n\\nThe poor girl, trying so hard, said it from her heart, and touched\\nmine. \"Caddy, my love,\" I replied, \"I begin to have a great affection\\nfor you, and I hope we shall become friends.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, do you?\" cried Caddy. \"How happy that would make me!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Caddy,\" said I, \"let us be friends from this time, and let\\nus often have a chat about these matters and try to find the right\\nway through them.\" Caddy was overjoyed. I said everything I could in\\nmy old-fashioned way to comfort and encourage her, and I would not\\nhave objected to old Mr. Turveydrop that day for any smaller\\nconsideration than a settlement on his daughter-in-law.\\n\\nBy this time we were come to Mr. Krook\\'s, whose private door stood\\nopen. There was a bill, pasted on the door-post, announcing a room to\\nlet on the second floor. It reminded Caddy to tell me as we proceeded\\nupstairs that there had been a sudden death there and an inquest and\\nthat our little friend had been ill of the fright. The door and\\nwindow of the vacant room being open, we looked in. It was the room\\nwith the dark door to which Miss Flite had secretly directed my\\nattention when I was last in the house. A sad and desolate place it\\nwas, a gloomy, sorrowful place that gave me a strange sensation of\\nmournfulness and even dread. \"You look pale,\" said Caddy when we came\\nout, \"and cold!\" I felt as if the room had chilled me.\\n\\nWe had walked slowly while we were talking, and my guardian and Ada\\nwere here before us. We found them in Miss Flite\\'s garret. They were\\nlooking at the birds, while a medical gentleman who was so good as to\\nattend Miss Flite with much solicitude and compassion spoke with her\\ncheerfully by the fire.\\n\\n\"I have finished my professional visit,\" he said, coming forward.\\n\"Miss Flite is much better and may appear in court (as her mind is\\nset upon it) to-morrow. She has been greatly missed there, I\\nunderstand.\"\\n\\nMiss Flite received the compliment with complacency and dropped a\\ngeneral curtsy to us.\\n\\n\"Honoured, indeed,\" said she, \"by another visit from the wards in\\nJarndyce! Ve-ry happy to receive Jarndyce of Bleak House beneath my\\nhumble roof!\" with a special curtsy. \"Fitz-Jarndyce, my dear\"--she\\nhad bestowed that name on Caddy, it appeared, and always called her\\nby it--\"a double welcome!\"\\n\\n\"Has she been very ill?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce of the gentleman whom we\\nhad found in attendance on her. She answered for herself directly,\\nthough he had put the question in a whisper.\\n\\n\"Oh, decidedly unwell! Oh, very unwell indeed,\" she said\\nconfidentially. \"Not pain, you know--trouble. Not bodily so much as\\nnervous, nervous! The truth is,\" in a subdued voice and trembling,\\n\"we have had death here. There was poison in the house. I am very\\nsusceptible to such horrid things. It frightened me. Only Mr.\\nWoodcourt knows how much. My physician, Mr. Woodcourt!\" with\\ngreat stateliness. \"The wards in Jarndyce--Jarndyce of Bleak\\nHouse--Fitz-Jarndyce!\"\\n\\n\"Miss Flite,\" said Mr. Woodcourt in a grave kind of voice, as if he\\nwere appealing to her while speaking to us, and laying his hand\\ngently on her arm, \"Miss Flite describes her illness with her usual\\naccuracy. She was alarmed by an occurrence in the house which might\\nhave alarmed a stronger person, and was made ill by the distress and\\nagitation. She brought me here in the first hurry of the discovery,\\nthough too late for me to be of any use to the unfortunate man. I\\nhave compensated myself for that disappointment by coming here since\\nand being of some small use to her.\"\\n\\n\"The kindest physician in the college,\" whispered Miss Flite to me.\\n\"I expect a judgment. On the day of judgment. And shall then confer\\nestates.\"\\n\\n\"She will be as well in a day or two,\" said Mr. Woodcourt, looking at\\nher with an observant smile, \"as she ever will be. In other words,\\nquite well of course. Have you heard of her good fortune?\"\\n\\n\"Most extraordinary!\" said Miss Flite, smiling brightly. \"You never\\nheard of such a thing, my dear! Every Saturday, Conversation Kenge or\\nGuppy (clerk to Conversation K.) places in my hand a paper of\\nshillings. Shillings. I assure you! Always the same number in the\\npaper. Always one for every day in the week. Now you know, really! So\\nwell-timed, is it not? Ye-es! From whence do these papers come, you\\nsay? That is the great question. Naturally. Shall I tell you what I\\nthink? I think,\" said Miss Flite, drawing herself back with a very\\nshrewd look and shaking her right forefinger in a most significant\\nmanner, \"that the Lord Chancellor, aware of the length of time during\\nwhich the Great Seal has been open (for it has been open a long\\ntime!), forwards them. Until the judgment I expect is given. Now\\nthat\\'s very creditable, you know. To confess in that way that he IS a\\nlittle slow for human life. So delicate! Attending court the other\\nday--I attend it regularly, with my documents--I taxed him with it,\\nand he almost confessed. That is, I smiled at him from my bench, and\\nHE smiled at me from his bench. But it\\'s great good fortune, is it\\nnot? And Fitz-Jarndyce lays the money out for me to great advantage.\\nOh, I assure you to the greatest advantage!\"\\n\\nI congratulated her (as she addressed herself to me) upon this\\nfortunate addition to her income and wished her a long continuance of\\nit. I did not speculate upon the source from which it came or wonder\\nwhose humanity was so considerate. My guardian stood before me,\\ncontemplating the birds, and I had no need to look beyond him.\\n\\n\"And what do you call these little fellows, ma\\'am?\" said he in his\\npleasant voice. \"Have they any names?\"\\n\\n\"I can answer for Miss Flite that they have,\" said I, \"for she\\npromised to tell us what they were. Ada remembers?\"\\n\\nAda remembered very well.\\n\\n\"Did I?\" said Miss Flite. \"Who\\'s that at my door? What are you\\nlistening at my door for, Krook?\"\\n\\nThe old man of the house, pushing it open before him, appeared there\\nwith his fur cap in his hand and his cat at his heels.\\n\\n\"I warn\\'t listening, Miss Flite,\" he said, \"I was going to give a rap\\nwith my knuckles, only you\\'re so quick!\"\\n\\n\"Make your cat go down. Drive her away!\" the old lady angrily\\nexclaimed.\\n\\n\"Bah, bah! There ain\\'t no danger, gentlefolks,\" said Mr. Krook,\\nlooking slowly and sharply from one to another until he had looked at\\nall of us; \"she\\'d never offer at the birds when I was here unless I\\ntold her to it.\"\\n\\n\"You will excuse my landlord,\" said the old lady with a dignified\\nair. \"M, quite M! What do you want, Krook, when I have company?\"\\n\\n\"Hi!\" said the old man. \"You know I am the Chancellor.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\" returned Miss Flite. \"What of that?\"\\n\\n\"For the Chancellor,\" said the old man with a chuckle, \"not to be\\nacquainted with a Jarndyce is queer, ain\\'t it, Miss Flite? Mightn\\'t I\\ntake the liberty? Your servant, sir. I know Jarndyce and Jarndyce\\na\\'most as well as you do, sir. I knowed old Squire Tom, sir. I never\\nto my knowledge see you afore though, not even in court. Yet, I go\\nthere a mortal sight of times in the course of the year, taking one\\nday with another.\"\\n\\n\"I never go there,\" said Mr. Jarndyce (which he never did on any\\nconsideration). \"I would sooner go--somewhere else.\"\\n\\n\"Would you though?\" returned Krook, grinning. \"You\\'re bearing hard\\nupon my noble and learned brother in your meaning, sir, though\\nperhaps it is but nat\\'ral in a Jarndyce. The burnt child, sir! What,\\nyou\\'re looking at my lodger\\'s birds, Mr. Jarndyce?\" The old man had\\ncome by little and little into the room until he now touched my\\nguardian with his elbow and looked close up into his face with his\\nspectacled eyes. \"It\\'s one of her strange ways that she\\'ll never tell\\nthe names of these birds if she can help it, though she named \\'em\\nall.\" This was in a whisper. \"Shall I run \\'em over, Flite?\" he asked\\naloud, winking at us and pointing at her as she turned away,\\naffecting to sweep the grate.\\n\\n\"If you like,\" she answered hurriedly.\\n\\nThe old man, looking up at the cages after another look at us, went\\nthrough the list.\\n\\n\"Hope, Joy, Youth, Peace, Rest, Life, Dust, Ashes, Waste, Want, Ruin,\\nDespair, Madness, Death, Cunning, Folly, Words, Wigs, Rags,\\nSheepskin, Plunder, Precedent, Jargon, Gammon, and Spinach. That\\'s\\nthe whole collection,\" said the old man, \"all cooped up together, by\\nmy noble and learned brother.\"\\n\\n\"This is a bitter wind!\" muttered my guardian.\\n\\n\"When my noble and learned brother gives his judgment, they\\'re to be\\nlet go free,\" said Krook, winking at us again. \"And then,\" he added,\\nwhispering and grinning, \"if that ever was to happen--which it\\nwon\\'t--the birds that have never been caged would kill \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"If ever the wind was in the east,\" said my guardian, pretending to\\nlook out of the window for a weathercock, \"I think it\\'s there\\nto-day!\"\\n\\nWe found it very difficult to get away from the house. It was not\\nMiss Flite who detained us; she was as reasonable a little creature\\nin consulting the convenience of others as there possibly could be.\\nIt was Mr. Krook. He seemed unable to detach himself from Mr.\\nJarndyce. If he had been linked to him, he could hardly have attended\\nhim more closely. He proposed to show us his Court of Chancery and\\nall the strange medley it contained; during the whole of our\\ninspection (prolonged by himself) he kept close to Mr. Jarndyce and\\nsometimes detained him under one pretence or other until we had\\npassed on, as if he were tormented by an inclination to enter upon\\nsome secret subject which he could not make up his mind to approach.\\nI cannot imagine a countenance and manner more singularly expressive\\nof caution and indecision, and a perpetual impulse to do something he\\ncould not resolve to venture on, than Mr. Krook\\'s was that day. His\\nwatchfulness of my guardian was incessant. He rarely removed his eyes\\nfrom his face. If he went on beside him, he observed him with the\\nslyness of an old white fox. If he went before, he looked back. When\\nwe stood still, he got opposite to him, and drawing his hand across\\nand across his open mouth with a curious expression of a sense of\\npower, and turning up his eyes, and lowering his grey eyebrows until\\nthey appeared to be shut, seemed to scan every lineament of his face.\\n\\nAt last, having been (always attended by the cat) all over the house\\nand having seen the whole stock of miscellaneous lumber, which was\\ncertainly curious, we came into the back part of the shop. Here on\\nthe head of an empty barrel stood on end were an ink-bottle, some old\\nstumps of pens, and some dirty playbills; and against the wall were\\npasted several large printed alphabets in several plain hands.\\n\\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked my guardian.\\n\\n\"Trying to learn myself to read and write,\" said Krook.\\n\\n\"And how do you get on?\"\\n\\n\"Slow. Bad,\" returned the old man impatiently. \"It\\'s hard at my time\\nof life.\"\\n\\n\"It would be easier to be taught by some one,\" said my guardian.\\n\\n\"Aye, but they might teach me wrong!\" returned the old man with a\\nwonderfully suspicious flash of his eye. \"I don\\'t know what I may\\nhave lost by not being learned afore. I wouldn\\'t like to lose\\nanything by being learned wrong now.\"\\n\\n\"Wrong?\" said my guardian with his good-humoured smile. \"Who do you\\nsuppose would teach you wrong?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House!\" replied the old man,\\nturning up his spectacles on his forehead and rubbing his hands. \"I\\ndon\\'t suppose as anybody would, but I\\'d rather trust my own self than\\nanother!\"\\n\\nThese answers and his manner were strange enough to cause my guardian\\nto inquire of Mr. Woodcourt, as we all walked across Lincoln\\'s Inn\\ntogether, whether Mr. Krook were really, as his lodger represented\\nhim, deranged. The young surgeon replied, no, he had seen no reason\\nto think so. He was exceedingly distrustful, as ignorance usually\\nwas, and he was always more or less under the influence of raw gin,\\nof which he drank great quantities and of which he and his back-shop,\\nas we might have observed, smelt strongly; but he did not think him\\nmad as yet.\\n\\nOn our way home, I so conciliated Peepy\\'s affections by buying him a\\nwindmill and two flour-sacks that he would suffer nobody else to take\\noff his hat and gloves and would sit nowhere at dinner but at my\\nside. Caddy sat upon the other side of me, next to Ada, to whom we\\nimparted the whole history of the engagement as soon as we got back.\\nWe made much of Caddy, and Peepy too; and Caddy brightened\\nexceedingly; and my guardian was as merry as we were; and we were all\\nvery happy indeed until Caddy went home at night in a hackney-coach,\\nwith Peepy fast asleep, but holding tight to the windmill.\\n\\nI have forgotten to mention--at least I have not mentioned--that Mr.\\nWoodcourt was the same dark young surgeon whom we had met at Mr.\\nBadger\\'s. Or that Mr. Jarndyce invited him to dinner that day. Or\\nthat he came. Or that when they were all gone and I said to Ada,\\n\"Now, my darling, let us have a little talk about Richard!\" Ada\\nlaughed and said--\\n\\nBut I don\\'t think it matters what my darling said. She was always\\nmerry.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile we were in London Mr. Jarndyce was constantly beset by the\\ncrowd of excitable ladies and gentlemen whose proceedings had so much\\nastonished us. Mr. Quale, who presented himself soon after our\\narrival, was in all such excitements. He seemed to project those two\\nshining knobs of temples of his into everything that went on and to\\nbrush his hair farther and farther back, until the very roots were\\nalmost ready to fly out of his head in inappeasable philanthropy. All\\nobjects were alike to him, but he was always particularly ready for\\nanything in the way of a testimonial to any one. His great power\\nseemed to be his power of indiscriminate admiration. He would sit for\\nany length of time, with the utmost enjoyment, bathing his temples in\\nthe light of any order of luminary. Having first seen him perfectly\\nswallowed up in admiration of Mrs. Jellyby, I had supposed her to be\\nthe absorbing object of his devotion. I soon discovered my mistake\\nand found him to be train-bearer and organ-blower to a whole\\nprocession of people.\\n\\nMrs. Pardiggle came one day for a subscription to something, and with\\nher, Mr. Quale. Whatever Mrs. Pardiggle said, Mr. Quale repeated to\\nus; and just as he had drawn Mrs. Jellyby out, he drew Mrs. Pardiggle\\nout. Mrs. Pardiggle wrote a letter of introduction to my guardian in\\nbehalf of her eloquent friend Mr. Gusher. With Mr. Gusher appeared\\nMr. Quale again. Mr. Gusher, being a flabby gentleman with a moist\\nsurface and eyes so much too small for his moon of a face that they\\nseemed to have been originally made for somebody else, was not at\\nfirst sight prepossessing; yet he was scarcely seated before Mr.\\nQuale asked Ada and me, not inaudibly, whether he was not a great\\ncreature--which he certainly was, flabbily speaking, though Mr. Quale\\nmeant in intellectual beauty--and whether we were not struck by his\\nmassive configuration of brow. In short, we heard of a great many\\nmissions of various sorts among this set of people, but nothing\\nrespecting them was half so clear to us as that it was Mr. Quale\\'s\\nmission to be in ecstasies with everybody else\\'s mission and that it\\nwas the most popular mission of all.\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce had fallen into this company in the tenderness of his\\nheart and his earnest desire to do all the good in his power; but\\nthat he felt it to be too often an unsatisfactory company, where\\nbenevolence took spasmodic forms, where charity was assumed as a\\nregular uniform by loud professors and speculators in cheap\\nnotoriety, vehement in profession, restless and vain in action,\\nservile in the last degree of meanness to the great, adulatory of one\\nanother, and intolerable to those who were anxious quietly to help\\nthe weak from failing rather than with a great deal of bluster and\\nself-laudation to raise them up a little way when they were down, he\\nplainly told us. When a testimonial was originated to Mr. Quale by\\nMr. Gusher (who had already got one, originated by Mr. Quale), and\\nwhen Mr. Gusher spoke for an hour and a half on the subject to a\\nmeeting, including two charity schools of small boys and girls, who\\nwere specially reminded of the widow\\'s mite, and requested to come\\nforward with halfpence and be acceptable sacrifices, I think the wind\\nwas in the east for three whole weeks.\\n\\nI mention this because I am coming to Mr. Skimpole again. It seemed\\nto me that his off-hand professions of childishness and carelessness\\nwere a great relief to my guardian, by contrast with such things, and\\nwere the more readily believed in since to find one perfectly\\nundesigning and candid man among many opposites could not fail to\\ngive him pleasure. I should be sorry to imply that Mr. Skimpole\\ndivined this and was politic; I really never understood him well\\nenough to know. What he was to my guardian, he certainly was to the\\nrest of the world.\\n\\nHe had not been very well; and thus, though he lived in London, we\\nhad seen nothing of him until now. He appeared one morning in his\\nusual agreeable way and as full of pleasant spirits as ever.\\n\\nWell, he said, here he was! He had been bilious, but rich men were\\noften bilious, and therefore he had been persuading himself that he\\nwas a man of property. So he was, in a certain point of view--in his\\nexpansive intentions. He had been enriching his medical attendant in\\nthe most lavish manner. He had always doubled, and sometimes\\nquadrupled, his fees. He had said to the doctor, \"Now, my dear\\ndoctor, it is quite a delusion on your part to suppose that you\\nattend me for nothing. I am overwhelming you with money--in my\\nexpansive intentions--if you only knew it!\" And really (he said) he\\nmeant it to that degree that he thought it much the same as doing it.\\nIf he had had those bits of metal or thin paper to which mankind\\nattached so much importance to put in the doctor\\'s hand, he would\\nhave put them in the doctor\\'s hand. Not having them, he substituted\\nthe will for the deed. Very well! If he really meant it--if his will\\nwere genuine and real, which it was--it appeared to him that it was\\nthe same as coin, and cancelled the obligation.\\n\\n\"It may be, partly, because I know nothing of the value of money,\"\\nsaid Mr. Skimpole, \"but I often feel this. It seems so reasonable! My\\nbutcher says to me he wants that little bill. It\\'s a part of the\\npleasant unconscious poetry of the man\\'s nature that he always calls\\nit a \\'little\\' bill--to make the payment appear easy to both of us. I\\nreply to the butcher, \\'My good friend, if you knew it, you are paid.\\nYou haven\\'t had the trouble of coming to ask for the little bill. You\\nare paid. I mean it.\\'\"\\n\\n\"But, suppose,\" said my guardian, laughing, \"he had meant the meat in\\nthe bill, instead of providing it?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Jarndyce,\" he returned, \"you surprise me. You take the\\nbutcher\\'s position. A butcher I once dealt with occupied that very\\nground. Says he, \\'Sir, why did you eat spring lamb at eighteen pence\\na pound?\\' \\'Why did I eat spring lamb at eighteen pence a pound, my\\nhonest friend?\\' said I, naturally amazed by the question. \\'I like\\nspring lamb!\\' This was so far convincing. \\'Well, sir,\\' says he, \\'I\\nwish I had meant the lamb as you mean the money!\\' \\'My good fellow,\\'\\nsaid I, \\'pray let us reason like intellectual beings. How could that\\nbe? It was impossible. You HAD got the lamb, and I have NOT got the\\nmoney. You couldn\\'t really mean the lamb without sending it in,\\nwhereas I can, and do, really mean the money without paying it!\\' He\\nhad not a word. There was an end of the subject.\"\\n\\n\"Did he take no legal proceedings?\" inquired my guardian.\\n\\n\"Yes, he took legal proceedings,\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"But in that he\\nwas influenced by passion, not by reason. Passion reminds me of\\nBoythorn. He writes me that you and the ladies have promised him a\\nshort visit at his bachelor-house in Lincolnshire.\"\\n\\n\"He is a great favourite with my girls,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"and I\\nhave promised for them.\"\\n\\n\"Nature forgot to shade him off, I think,\" observed Mr. Skimpole to\\nAda and me. \"A little too boisterous--like the sea. A little too\\nvehement--like a bull who has made up his mind to consider every\\ncolour scarlet. But I grant a sledge-hammering sort of merit in him!\"\\n\\nI should have been surprised if those two could have thought very\\nhighly of one another, Mr. Boythorn attaching so much importance to\\nmany things and Mr. Skimpole caring so little for anything. Besides\\nwhich, I had noticed Mr. Boythorn more than once on the point of\\nbreaking out into some strong opinion when Mr. Skimpole was referred\\nto. Of course I merely joined Ada in saying that we had been greatly\\npleased with him.\\n\\n\"He has invited me,\" said Mr. Skimpole; \"and if a child may trust\\nhimself in such hands--which the present child is encouraged to do,\\nwith the united tenderness of two angels to guard him--I shall go. He\\nproposes to frank me down and back again. I suppose it will cost\\nmoney? Shillings perhaps? Or pounds? Or something of that sort? By\\nthe by, Coavinses. You remember our friend Coavinses, Miss\\nSummerson?\"\\n\\nHe asked me as the subject arose in his mind, in his graceful,\\nlight-hearted manner and without the least embarrassment.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" said I.\\n\\n\"Coavinses has been arrested by the Great Bailiff,\" said Mr.\\nSkimpole. \"He will never do violence to the sunshine any more.\"\\n\\nIt quite shocked me to hear it, for I had already recalled with\\nanything but a serious association the image of the man sitting on\\nthe sofa that night wiping his head.\\n\\n\"His successor informed me of it yesterday,\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"His\\nsuccessor is in my house now--in possession, I think he calls it. He\\ncame yesterday, on my blue-eyed daughter\\'s birthday. I put it to him,\\n\\'This is unreasonable and inconvenient. If you had a blue-eyed\\ndaughter you wouldn\\'t like ME to come, uninvited, on HER birthday?\\'\\nBut he stayed.\"\\n\\nMr. Skimpole laughed at the pleasant absurdity and lightly touched\\nthe piano by which he was seated.\\n\\n\"And he told me,\" he said, playing little chords where I shall put\\nfull stops, \"The Coavinses had left. Three children. No mother. And\\nthat Coavinses\\' profession. Being unpopular. The rising Coavinses.\\nWere at a considerable disadvantage.\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce got up, rubbing his head, and began to walk about. Mr.\\nSkimpole played the melody of one of Ada\\'s favourite songs. Ada and I\\nboth looked at Mr. Jarndyce, thinking that we knew what was passing\\nin his mind.\\n\\nAfter walking and stopping, and several times leaving off rubbing his\\nhead, and beginning again, my guardian put his hand upon the keys and\\nstopped Mr. Skimpole\\'s playing. \"I don\\'t like this, Skimpole,\" he\\nsaid thoughtfully.\\n\\nMr. Skimpole, who had quite forgotten the subject, looked up\\nsurprised.\\n\\n\"The man was necessary,\" pursued my guardian, walking backward and\\nforward in the very short space between the piano and the end of the\\nroom and rubbing his hair up from the back of his head as if a high\\neast wind had blown it into that form. \"If we make such men necessary\\nby our faults and follies, or by our want of worldly knowledge, or by\\nour misfortunes, we must not revenge ourselves upon them. There was\\nno harm in his trade. He maintained his children. One would like to\\nknow more about this.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Coavinses?\" cried Mr. Skimpole, at length perceiving what he\\nmeant. \"Nothing easier. A walk to Coavinses\\' headquarters, and you\\ncan know what you will.\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce nodded to us, who were only waiting for the signal.\\n\"Come! We will walk that way, my dears. Why not that way as soon as\\nanother!\" We were quickly ready and went out. Mr. Skimpole went with\\nus and quite enjoyed the expedition. It was so new and so refreshing,\\nhe said, for him to want Coavinses instead of Coavinses wanting him!\\n\\nHe took us, first, to Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane, where there was\\na house with barred windows, which he called Coavinses\\' Castle. On\\nour going into the entry and ringing a bell, a very hideous boy came\\nout of a sort of office and looked at us over a spiked wicket.\\n\\n\"Who did you want?\" said the boy, fitting two of the spikes into his\\nchin.\\n\\n\"There was a follower, or an officer, or something, here,\" said Mr.\\nJarndyce, \"who is dead.\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\" said the boy. \"Well?\"\\n\\n\"I want to know his name, if you please?\"\\n\\n\"Name of Neckett,\" said the boy.\\n\\n\"And his address?\"\\n\\n\"Bell Yard,\" said the boy. \"Chandler\\'s shop, left hand side, name of\\nBlinder.\"\\n\\n\"Was he--I don\\'t know how to shape the question--\" murmured my\\nguardian, \"industrious?\"\\n\\n\"Was Neckett?\" said the boy. \"Yes, wery much so. He was never tired\\nof watching. He\\'d set upon a post at a street corner eight or ten\\nhours at a stretch if he undertook to do it.\"\\n\\n\"He might have done worse,\" I heard my guardian soliloquize. \"He\\nmight have undertaken to do it and not done it. Thank you. That\\'s all\\nI want.\"\\n\\nWe left the boy, with his head on one side and his arms on the gate,\\nfondling and sucking the spikes, and went back to Lincoln\\'s Inn,\\nwhere Mr. Skimpole, who had not cared to remain nearer Coavinses,\\nawaited us. Then we all went to Bell Yard, a narrow alley at a very\\nshort distance. We soon found the chandler\\'s shop. In it was a\\ngood-natured-looking old woman with a dropsy, or an asthma, or\\nperhaps both.\\n\\n\"Neckett\\'s children?\" said she in reply to my inquiry. \"Yes, Surely,\\nmiss. Three pair, if you please. Door right opposite the stairs.\" And\\nshe handed me the key across the counter.\\n\\nI glanced at the key and glanced at her, but she took it for granted\\nthat I knew what to do with it. As it could only be intended for the\\nchildren\\'s door, I came out without asking any more questions and led\\nthe way up the dark stairs. We went as quietly as we could, but four\\nof us made some noise on the aged boards, and when we came to the\\nsecond story we found we had disturbed a man who was standing there\\nlooking out of his room.\\n\\n\"Is it Gridley that\\'s wanted?\" he said, fixing his eyes on me with an\\nangry stare.\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" said I; \"I am going higher up.\"\\n\\nHe looked at Ada, and at Mr. Jarndyce, and at Mr. Skimpole, fixing\\nthe same angry stare on each in succession as they passed and\\nfollowed me. Mr. Jarndyce gave him good day. \"Good day!\" he said\\nabruptly and fiercely. He was a tall, sallow man with a careworn head\\non which but little hair remained, a deeply lined face, and prominent\\neyes. He had a combative look and a chafing, irritable manner which,\\nassociated with his figure--still large and powerful, though\\nevidently in its decline--rather alarmed me. He had a pen in his\\nhand, and in the glimpse I caught of his room in passing, I saw that\\nit was covered with a litter of papers.\\n\\nLeaving him standing there, we went up to the top room. I tapped at\\nthe door, and a little shrill voice inside said, \"We are locked in.\\nMrs. Blinder\\'s got the key!\"\\n\\nI applied the key on hearing this and opened the door. In a poor room\\nwith a sloping ceiling and containing very little furniture was a\\nmite of a boy, some five or six years old, nursing and hushing a\\nheavy child of eighteen months. There was no fire, though the weather\\nwas cold; both children were wrapped in some poor shawls and tippets\\nas a substitute. Their clothing was not so warm, however, but that\\ntheir noses looked red and pinched and their small figures shrunken\\nas the boy walked up and down nursing and hushing the child with its\\nhead on his shoulder.\\n\\n\"Who has locked you up here alone?\" we naturally asked.\\n\\n\"Charley,\" said the boy, standing still to gaze at us.\\n\\n\"Is Charley your brother?\"\\n\\n\"No. She\\'s my sister, Charlotte. Father called her Charley.\"\\n\\n\"Are there any more of you besides Charley?\"\\n\\n\"Me,\" said the boy, \"and Emma,\" patting the limp bonnet of the child\\nhe was nursing. \"And Charley.\"\\n\\n\"Where is Charley now?\"\\n\\n\"Out a-washing,\" said the boy, beginning to walk up and down again\\nand taking the nankeen bonnet much too near the bedstead by trying to\\ngaze at us at the same time.\\n\\nWe were looking at one another and at these two children when there\\ncame into the room a very little girl, childish in figure but shrewd\\nand older-looking in the face--pretty-faced too--wearing a womanly\\nsort of bonnet much too large for her and drying her bare arms on a\\nwomanly sort of apron. Her fingers were white and wrinkled with\\nwashing, and the soap-suds were yet smoking which she wiped off her\\narms. But for this, she might have been a child playing at washing\\nand imitating a poor working-woman with a quick observation of the\\ntruth.\\n\\nShe had come running from some place in the neighbourhood and had\\nmade all the haste she could. Consequently, though she was very\\nlight, she was out of breath and could not speak at first, as she\\nstood panting, and wiping her arms, and looking quietly at us.\\n\\n\"Oh, here\\'s Charley!\" said the boy.\\n\\nThe child he was nursing stretched forth its arms and cried out to be\\ntaken by Charley. The little girl took it, in a womanly sort of\\nmanner belonging to the apron and the bonnet, and stood looking at us\\nover the burden that clung to her most affectionately.\\n\\n\"Is it possible,\" whispered my guardian as we put a chair for the\\nlittle creature and got her to sit down with her load, the boy\\nkeeping close to her, holding to her apron, \"that this child works\\nfor the rest? Look at this! For God\\'s sake, look at this!\"\\n\\nIt was a thing to look at. The three children close together, and two\\nof them relying solely on the third, and the third so young and yet\\nwith an air of age and steadiness that sat so strangely on the\\nchildish figure.\\n\\n\"Charley, Charley!\" said my guardian. \"How old are you?\"\\n\\n\"Over thirteen, sir,\" replied the child.\\n\\n\"Oh! What a great age,\" said my guardian. \"What a great age,\\nCharley!\"\\n\\nI cannot describe the tenderness with which he spoke to her, half\\nplayfully yet all the more compassionately and mournfully.\\n\\n\"And do you live alone here with these babies, Charley?\" said my\\nguardian.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" returned the child, looking up into his face with perfect\\nconfidence, \"since father died.\"\\n\\n\"And how do you live, Charley? Oh! Charley,\" said my guardian,\\nturning his face away for a moment, \"how do you live?\"\\n\\n\"Since father died, sir, I\\'ve gone out to work. I\\'m out washing\\nto-day.\"\\n\\n\"God help you, Charley!\" said my guardian. \"You\\'re not tall enough to\\nreach the tub!\"\\n\\n\"In pattens I am, sir,\" she said quickly. \"I\\'ve got a high pair as\\nbelonged to mother.\"\\n\\n\"And when did mother die? Poor mother!\"\\n\\n\"Mother died just after Emma was born,\" said the child, glancing at\\nthe face upon her bosom. \"Then father said I was to be as good a\\nmother to her as I could. And so I tried. And so I worked at home and\\ndid cleaning and nursing and washing for a long time before I began\\nto go out. And that\\'s how I know how; don\\'t you see, sir?\"\\n\\n\"And do you often go out?\"\\n\\n\"As often as I can,\" said Charley, opening her eyes and smiling,\\n\"because of earning sixpences and shillings!\"\\n\\n\"And do you always lock the babies up when you go out?\"\\n\\n\"To keep \\'em safe, sir, don\\'t you see?\" said Charley. \"Mrs. Blinder\\ncomes up now and then, and Mr. Gridley comes up sometimes, and\\nperhaps I can run in sometimes, and they can play you know, and Tom\\nan\\'t afraid of being locked up, are you, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"No-o!\" said Tom stoutly.\\n\\n\"When it comes on dark, the lamps are lighted down in the court, and\\nthey show up here quite bright--almost quite bright. Don\\'t they,\\nTom?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Charley,\" said Tom, \"almost quite bright.\"\\n\\n\"Then he\\'s as good as gold,\" said the little creature--Oh, in such a\\nmotherly, womanly way! \"And when Emma\\'s tired, he puts her to bed.\\nAnd when he\\'s tired he goes to bed himself. And when I come home and\\nlight the candle and has a bit of supper, he sits up again and has it\\nwith me. Don\\'t you, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, Charley!\" said Tom. \"That I do!\" And either in this glimpse\\nof the great pleasure of his life or in gratitude and love for\\nCharley, who was all in all to him, he laid his face among the scanty\\nfolds of her frock and passed from laughing into crying.\\n\\nIt was the first time since our entry that a tear had been shed among\\nthese children. The little orphan girl had spoken of their father and\\ntheir mother as if all that sorrow were subdued by the necessity of\\ntaking courage, and by her childish importance in being able to work,\\nand by her bustling busy way. But now, when Tom cried, although she\\nsat quite tranquil, looking quietly at us, and did not by any\\nmovement disturb a hair of the head of either of her little charges,\\nI saw two silent tears fall down her face.\\n\\nI stood at the window with Ada, pretending to look at the housetops,\\nand the blackened stack of chimneys, and the poor plants, and the\\nbirds in little cages belonging to the neighbours, when I found that\\nMrs. Blinder, from the shop below, had come in (perhaps it had taken\\nher all this time to get upstairs) and was talking to my guardian.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not much to forgive \\'em the rent, sir,\" she said; \"who could\\ntake it from them!\"\\n\\n\"Well, well!\" said my guardian to us two. \"It is enough that the time\\nwill come when this good woman will find that it WAS much, and that\\nforasmuch as she did it unto the least of these--This child,\" he\\nadded after a few moments, \"could she possibly continue this?\"\\n\\n\"Really, sir, I think she might,\" said Mrs. Blinder, getting her\\nheavy breath by painful degrees. \"She\\'s as handy as it\\'s possible to\\nbe. Bless you, sir, the way she tended them two children after the\\nmother died was the talk of the yard! And it was a wonder to see her\\nwith him after he was took ill, it really was! \\'Mrs. Blinder,\\' he\\nsaid to me the very last he spoke--he was lying there--\\'Mrs.\\nBlinder, whatever my calling may have been, I see a angel sitting in\\nthis room last night along with my child, and I trust her to Our\\nFather!\\'\"\\n\\n\"He had no other calling?\" said my guardian.\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" returned Mrs. Blinder, \"he was nothing but a follerers.\\nWhen he first came to lodge here, I didn\\'t know what he was, and I\\nconfess that when I found out I gave him notice. It wasn\\'t liked in\\nthe yard. It wasn\\'t approved by the other lodgers. It is NOT a\\ngenteel calling,\" said Mrs. Blinder, \"and most people do object to\\nit. Mr. Gridley objected to it very strong, and he is a good lodger,\\nthough his temper has been hard tried.\"\\n\\n\"So you gave him notice?\" said my guardian.\\n\\n\"So I gave him notice,\" said Mrs. Blinder. \"But really when the time\\ncame, and I knew no other ill of him, I was in doubts. He was\\npunctual and diligent; he did what he had to do, sir,\" said Mrs.\\nBlinder, unconsciously fixing Mr. Skimpole with her eye, \"and it\\'s\\nsomething in this world even to do that.\"\\n\\n\"So you kept him after all?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I said that if he could arrange with Mr. Gridley, I could\\narrange it with the other lodgers and should not so much mind its\\nbeing liked or disliked in the yard. Mr. Gridley gave his consent\\ngruff--but gave it. He was always gruff with him, but he has been\\nkind to the children since. A person is never known till a person is\\nproved.\"\\n\\n\"Have many people been kind to the children?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Upon the whole, not so bad, sir,\" said Mrs. Blinder; \"but certainly\\nnot so many as would have been if their father\\'s calling had been\\ndifferent. Mr. Coavins gave a guinea, and the follerers made up a\\nlittle purse. Some neighbours in the yard that had always joked and\\ntapped their shoulders when he went by came forward with a little\\nsubscription, and--in general--not so bad. Similarly with Charlotte.\\nSome people won\\'t employ her because she was a follerer\\'s child; some\\npeople that do employ her cast it at her; some make a merit of having\\nher to work for them, with that and all her draw-backs upon her, and\\nperhaps pay her less and put upon her more. But she\\'s patienter than\\nothers would be, and is clever too, and always willing, up to the\\nfull mark of her strength and over. So I should say, in general, not\\nso bad, sir, but might be better.\"\\n\\nMrs. Blinder sat down to give herself a more favourable opportunity\\nof recovering her breath, exhausted anew by so much talking before it\\nwas fully restored. Mr. Jarndyce was turning to speak to us when his\\nattention was attracted by the abrupt entrance into the room of the\\nMr. Gridley who had been mentioned and whom we had seen on our way\\nup.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what you may be doing here, ladies and gentlemen,\" he\\nsaid, as if he resented our presence, \"but you\\'ll excuse my coming\\nin. I don\\'t come in to stare about me. Well, Charley! Well, Tom!\\nWell, little one! How is it with us all to-day?\"\\n\\nHe bent over the group in a caressing way and clearly was regarded as\\na friend by the children, though his face retained its stern\\ncharacter and his manner to us was as rude as it could be. My\\nguardian noticed it and respected it.\\n\\n\"No one, surely, would come here to stare about him,\" he said mildly.\\n\\n\"May be so, sir, may be so,\" returned the other, taking Tom upon his\\nknee and waving him off impatiently. \"I don\\'t want to argue with\\nladies and gentlemen. I have had enough of arguing to last one man\\nhis life.\"\\n\\n\"You have sufficient reason, I dare say,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"for\\nbeing chafed and irritated--\"\\n\\n\"There again!\" exclaimed the man, becoming violently angry. \"I am of\\na quarrelsome temper. I am irascible. I am not polite!\"\\n\\n\"Not very, I think.\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" said Gridley, putting down the child and going up to him as if\\nhe meant to strike him, \"do you know anything of Courts of Equity?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I do, to my sorrow.\"\\n\\n\"To your sorrow?\" said the man, pausing in his wrath, \"if so, I beg\\nyour pardon. I am not polite, I know. I beg your pardon! Sir,\" with\\nrenewed violence, \"I have been dragged for five and twenty years over\\nburning iron, and I have lost the habit of treading upon velvet. Go\\ninto the Court of Chancery yonder and ask what is one of the standing\\njokes that brighten up their business sometimes, and they will tell\\nyou that the best joke they have is the man from Shropshire. I,\" he\\nsaid, beating one hand on the other passionately, \"am the man from\\nShropshire.\"\\n\\n\"I believe I and my family have also had the honour of furnishing\\nsome entertainment in the same grave place,\" said my guardian\\ncomposedly. \"You may have heard my name--Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" said Gridley with a rough sort of salutation, \"you\\nbear your wrongs more quietly than I can bear mine. More than that, I\\ntell you--and I tell this gentleman, and these young ladies, if they\\nare friends of yours--that if I took my wrongs in any other way, I\\nshould be driven mad! It is only by resenting them, and by revenging\\nthem in my mind, and by angrily demanding the justice I never get,\\nthat I am able to keep my wits together. It is only that!\" he said,\\nspeaking in a homely, rustic way and with great vehemence. \"You may\\ntell me that I over-excite myself. I answer that it\\'s in my nature to\\ndo it, under wrong, and I must do it. There\\'s nothing between doing\\nit, and sinking into the smiling state of the poor little mad woman\\nthat haunts the court. If I was once to sit down under it, I should\\nbecome imbecile.\"\\n\\nThe passion and heat in which he was, and the manner in which his\\nface worked, and the violent gestures with which he accompanied what\\nhe said, were most painful to see.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he said, \"consider my case. As true as there is a\\nheaven above us, this is my case. I am one of two brothers. My father\\n(a farmer) made a will and left his farm and stock and so forth to my\\nmother for her life. After my mother\\'s death, all was to come to me\\nexcept a legacy of three hundred pounds that I was then to pay my\\nbrother. My mother died. My brother some time afterwards claimed his\\nlegacy. I and some of my relations said that he had had a part of it\\nalready in board and lodging and some other things. Now mind! That\\nwas the question, and nothing else. No one disputed the will; no one\\ndisputed anything but whether part of that three hundred pounds had\\nbeen already paid or not. To settle that question, my brother filing\\na bill, I was obliged to go into this accursed Chancery; I was forced\\nthere because the law forced me and would let me go nowhere else.\\nSeventeen people were made defendants to that simple suit! It first\\ncame on after two years. It was then stopped for another two years\\nwhile the master (may his head rot off!) inquired whether I was my\\nfather\\'s son, about which there was no dispute at all with any mortal\\ncreature. He then found out that there were not defendants\\nenough--remember, there were only seventeen as yet!--but that we must\\nhave another who had been left out and must begin all over again. The\\ncosts at that time--before the thing was begun!--were three times the\\nlegacy. My brother would have given up the legacy, and joyful, to\\nescape more costs. My whole estate, left to me in that will of my\\nfather\\'s, has gone in costs. The suit, still undecided, has fallen\\ninto rack, and ruin, and despair, with everything else--and here I\\nstand, this day! Now, Mr. Jarndyce, in your suit there are thousands\\nand thousands involved, where in mine there are hundreds. Is mine\\nless hard to bear or is it harder to bear, when my whole living was\\nin it and has been thus shamefully sucked away?\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce said that he condoled with him with all his heart and\\nthat he set up no monopoly himself in being unjustly treated by this\\nmonstrous system.\\n\\n\"There again!\" said Mr. Gridley with no diminution of his rage. \"The\\nsystem! I am told on all hands, it\\'s the system. I mustn\\'t look to\\nindividuals. It\\'s the system. I mustn\\'t go into court and say, \\'My\\nLord, I beg to know this from you--is this right or wrong? Have you\\nthe face to tell me I have received justice and therefore am\\ndismissed?\\' My Lord knows nothing of it. He sits there to administer\\nthe system. I mustn\\'t go to Mr. Tulkinghorn, the solicitor in\\nLincoln\\'s Inn Fields, and say to him when he makes me furious by\\nbeing so cool and satisfied--as they all do, for I know they gain by\\nit while I lose, don\\'t I?--I mustn\\'t say to him, \\'I will have\\nsomething out of some one for my ruin, by fair means or foul!\\' HE is\\nnot responsible. It\\'s the system. But, if I do no violence to any of\\nthem, here--I may! I don\\'t know what may happen if I am carried\\nbeyond myself at last! I will accuse the individual workers of that\\nsystem against me, face to face, before the great eternal bar!\"\\n\\nHis passion was fearful. I could not have believed in such rage\\nwithout seeing it.\\n\\n\"I have done!\" he said, sitting down and wiping his face. \"Mr.\\nJarndyce, I have done! I am violent, I know. I ought to know it. I\\nhave been in prison for contempt of court. I have been in prison for\\nthreatening the solicitor. I have been in this trouble, and that\\ntrouble, and shall be again. I am the man from Shropshire, and I\\nsometimes go beyond amusing them, though they have found it amusing,\\ntoo, to see me committed into custody and brought up in custody and\\nall that. It would be better for me, they tell me, if I restrained\\nmyself. I tell them that if I did restrain myself I should become\\nimbecile. I was a good-enough-tempered man once, I believe. People in\\nmy part of the country say they remember me so, but now I must have\\nthis vent under my sense of injury or nothing could hold my wits\\ntogether. It would be far better for you, Mr. Gridley,\\' the Lord\\nChancellor told me last week, \\'not to waste your time here, and to\\nstay, usefully employed, down in Shropshire.\\' \\'My Lord, my Lord, I\\nknow it would,\\' said I to him, \\'and it would have been far better for\\nme never to have heard the name of your high office, but unhappily\\nfor me, I can\\'t undo the past, and the past drives me here!\\'\\nBesides,\" he added, breaking fiercely out, \"I\\'ll shame them. To the\\nlast, I\\'ll show myself in that court to its shame. If I knew when I\\nwas going to die, and could be carried there, and had a voice to\\nspeak with, I would die there, saying, \\'You have brought me here and\\nsent me from here many and many a time. Now send me out feet\\nforemost!\\'\"\\n\\nHis countenance had, perhaps for years, become so set in its\\ncontentious expression that it did not soften, even now when he was\\nquiet.\\n\\n\"I came to take these babies down to my room for an hour,\" he said,\\ngoing to them again, \"and let them play about. I didn\\'t mean to say\\nall this, but it don\\'t much signify. You\\'re not afraid of me, Tom,\\nare you?\"\\n\\n\"No!\" said Tom. \"You ain\\'t angry with ME.\"\\n\\n\"You are right, my child. You\\'re going back, Charley? Aye? Come then,\\nlittle one!\" He took the youngest child on his arm, where she was\\nwilling enough to be carried. \"I shouldn\\'t wonder if we found a\\nginger-bread soldier downstairs. Let\\'s go and look for him!\"\\n\\nHe made his former rough salutation, which was not deficient in a\\ncertain respect, to Mr. Jarndyce, and bowing slightly to us, went\\ndownstairs to his room.\\n\\nUpon that, Mr. Skimpole began to talk, for the first time since our\\narrival, in his usual gay strain. He said, Well, it was really very\\npleasant to see how things lazily adapted themselves to purposes.\\nHere was this Mr. Gridley, a man of a robust will and surprising\\nenergy--intellectually speaking, a sort of inharmonious\\nblacksmith--and he could easily imagine that there Gridley was, years\\nago, wandering about in life for something to expend his superfluous\\ncombativeness upon--a sort of Young Love among the thorns--when the\\nCourt of Chancery came in his way and accommodated him with the exact\\nthing he wanted. There they were, matched, ever afterwards! Otherwise\\nhe might have been a great general, blowing up all sorts of towns, or\\nhe might have been a great politician, dealing in all sorts of\\nparliamentary rhetoric; but as it was, he and the Court of Chancery\\nhad fallen upon each other in the pleasantest way, and nobody was\\nmuch the worse, and Gridley was, so to speak, from that hour provided\\nfor. Then look at Coavinses! How delightfully poor Coavinses (father\\nof these charming children) illustrated the same principle! He, Mr.\\nSkimpole, himself, had sometimes repined at the existence of\\nCoavinses. He had found Coavinses in his way. He could had dispensed\\nwith Coavinses. There had been times when, if he had been a sultan,\\nand his grand vizier had said one morning, \"What does the Commander\\nof the Faithful require at the hands of his slave?\" he might have\\neven gone so far as to reply, \"The head of Coavinses!\" But what\\nturned out to be the case? That, all that time, he had been giving\\nemployment to a most deserving man, that he had been a benefactor to\\nCoavinses, that he had actually been enabling Coavinses to bring up\\nthese charming children in this agreeable way, developing these\\nsocial virtues! Insomuch that his heart had just now swelled and the\\ntears had come into his eyes when he had looked round the room and\\nthought, \"I was the great patron of Coavinses, and his little\\ncomforts were MY work!\"\\n\\nThere was something so captivating in his light way of touching these\\nfantastic strings, and he was such a mirthful child by the side of\\nthe graver childhood we had seen, that he made my guardian smile even\\nas he turned towards us from a little private talk with Mrs. Blinder.\\nWe kissed Charley, and took her downstairs with us, and stopped\\noutside the house to see her run away to her work. I don\\'t know where\\nshe was going, but we saw her run, such a little, little creature in\\nher womanly bonnet and apron, through a covered way at the bottom of\\nthe court and melt into the city\\'s strife and sound like a dewdrop in\\nan ocean.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy Lady Dedlock is restless, very restless. The astonished\\nfashionable intelligence hardly knows where to have her. To-day she\\nis at Chesney Wold; yesterday she was at her house in town; to-morrow\\nshe may be abroad, for anything the fashionable intelligence can with\\nconfidence predict. Even Sir Leicester\\'s gallantry has some trouble\\nto keep pace with her. It would have more but that his other faithful\\nally, for better and for worse--the gout--darts into the old oak\\nbed-chamber at Chesney Wold and grips him by both legs.\\n\\nSir Leicester receives the gout as a troublesome demon, but still a\\ndemon of the patrician order. All the Dedlocks, in the direct male\\nline, through a course of time during and beyond which the memory of\\nman goeth not to the contrary, have had the gout. It can be proved,\\nsir. Other men\\'s fathers may have died of the rheumatism or may have\\ntaken base contagion from the tainted blood of the sick vulgar, but\\nthe Dedlock family have communicated something exclusive even to the\\nlevelling process of dying by dying of their own family gout. It has\\ncome down through the illustrious line like the plate, or the\\npictures, or the place in Lincolnshire. It is among their dignities.\\nSir Leicester is perhaps not wholly without an impression, though he\\nhas never resolved it into words, that the angel of death in the\\ndischarge of his necessary duties may observe to the shades of the\\naristocracy, \"My lords and gentlemen, I have the honour to present to\\nyou another Dedlock certified to have arrived per the family gout.\"\\n\\nHence Sir Leicester yields up his family legs to the family disorder\\nas if he held his name and fortune on that feudal tenure. He feels\\nthat for a Dedlock to be laid upon his back and spasmodically\\ntwitched and stabbed in his extremities is a liberty taken somewhere,\\nbut he thinks, \"We have all yielded to this; it belongs to us; it has\\nfor some hundreds of years been understood that we are not to make\\nthe vaults in the park interesting on more ignoble terms; and I\\nsubmit myself to the compromise.\"\\n\\nAnd a goodly show he makes, lying in a flush of crimson and gold in\\nthe midst of the great drawing-room before his favourite picture of\\nmy Lady, with broad strips of sunlight shining in, down the long\\nperspective, through the long line of windows, and alternating with\\nsoft reliefs of shadow. Outside, the stately oaks, rooted for ages in\\nthe green ground which has never known ploughshare, but was still a\\nchase when kings rode to battle with sword and shield and rode\\na-hunting with bow and arrow, bear witness to his greatness. Inside,\\nhis forefathers, looking on him from the walls, say, \"Each of us was\\na passing reality here and left this coloured shadow of himself and\\nmelted into remembrance as dreamy as the distant voices of the rooks\\nnow lulling you to rest,\" and hear their testimony to his greatness\\ntoo. And he is very great this day. And woe to Boythorn or other\\ndaring wight who shall presumptuously contest an inch with him!\\n\\nMy Lady is at present represented, near Sir Leicester, by her\\nportrait. She has flitted away to town, with no intention of\\nremaining there, and will soon flit hither again, to the confusion of\\nthe fashionable intelligence. The house in town is not prepared for\\nher reception. It is muffled and dreary. Only one Mercury in powder\\ngapes disconsolate at the hall-window; and he mentioned last night to\\nanother Mercury of his acquaintance, also accustomed to good society,\\nthat if that sort of thing was to last--which it couldn\\'t, for a man\\nof his spirits couldn\\'t bear it, and a man of his figure couldn\\'t be\\nexpected to bear it--there would be no resource for him, upon his\\nhonour, but to cut his throat!\\n\\nWhat connexion can there be between the place in Lincolnshire, the\\nhouse in town, the Mercury in powder, and the whereabout of Jo the\\noutlaw with the broom, who had that distant ray of light upon him\\nwhen he swept the churchyard-step? What connexion can there have been\\nbetween many people in the innumerable histories of this world who\\nfrom opposite sides of great gulfs have, nevertheless, been very\\ncuriously brought together!\\n\\nJo sweeps his crossing all day long, unconscious of the link, if any\\nlink there be. He sums up his mental condition when asked a question\\nby replying that he \"don\\'t know nothink.\" He knows that it\\'s hard to\\nkeep the mud off the crossing in dirty weather, and harder still to\\nlive by doing it. Nobody taught him even that much; he found it out.\\n\\nJo lives--that is to say, Jo has not yet died--in a ruinous place\\nknown to the like of him by the name of Tom-all-Alone\\'s. It is a\\nblack, dilapidated street, avoided by all decent people, where the\\ncrazy houses were seized upon, when their decay was far advanced, by\\nsome bold vagrants who after establishing their own possession took\\nto letting them out in lodgings. Now, these tumbling tenements\\ncontain, by night, a swarm of misery. As on the ruined human wretch\\nvermin parasites appear, so these ruined shelters have bred a crowd\\nof foul existence that crawls in and out of gaps in walls and boards;\\nand coils itself to sleep, in maggot numbers, where the rain drips\\nin; and comes and goes, fetching and carrying fever and sowing more\\nevil in its every footprint than Lord Coodle, and Sir Thomas Doodle,\\nand the Duke of Foodle, and all the fine gentlemen in office, down to\\nZoodle, shall set right in five hundred years--though born expressly\\nto do it.\\n\\nTwice lately there has been a crash and a cloud of dust, like the\\nspringing of a mine, in Tom-all-Alone\\'s; and each time a house has\\nfallen. These accidents have made a paragraph in the newspapers and\\nhave filled a bed or two in the nearest hospital. The gaps remain,\\nand there are not unpopular lodgings among the rubbish. As several\\nmore houses are nearly ready to go, the next crash in Tom-all-Alone\\'s\\nmay be expected to be a good one.\\n\\nThis desirable property is in Chancery, of course. It would be an\\ninsult to the discernment of any man with half an eye to tell him so.\\nWhether \"Tom\" is the popular representative of the original plaintiff\\nor defendant in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, or whether Tom lived here when\\nthe suit had laid the street waste, all alone, until other settlers\\ncame to join him, or whether the traditional title is a comprehensive\\nname for a retreat cut off from honest company and put out of the\\npale of hope, perhaps nobody knows. Certainly Jo don\\'t know.\\n\\n\"For I don\\'t,\" says Jo, \"I don\\'t know nothink.\"\\n\\nIt must be a strange state to be like Jo! To shuffle through the\\nstreets, unfamiliar with the shapes, and in utter darkness as to the\\nmeaning, of those mysterious symbols, so abundant over the shops, and\\nat the corners of streets, and on the doors, and in the windows! To\\nsee people read, and to see people write, and to see the postmen\\ndeliver letters, and not to have the least idea of all that\\nlanguage--to be, to every scrap of it, stone blind and dumb! It must\\nbe very puzzling to see the good company going to the churches on\\nSundays, with their books in their hands, and to think (for perhaps\\nJo DOES think at odd times) what does it all mean, and if it means\\nanything to anybody, how comes it that it means nothing to me? To be\\nhustled, and jostled, and moved on; and really to feel that it would\\nappear to be perfectly true that I have no business here, or there,\\nor anywhere; and yet to be perplexed by the consideration that I AM\\nhere somehow, too, and everybody overlooked me until I became the\\ncreature that I am! It must be a strange state, not merely to be told\\nthat I am scarcely human (as in the case of my offering myself for a\\nwitness), but to feel it of my own knowledge all my life! To see the\\nhorses, dogs, and cattle go by me and to know that in ignorance I\\nbelong to them and not to the superior beings in my shape, whose\\ndelicacy I offend! Jo\\'s ideas of a criminal trial, or a judge, or a\\nbishop, or a government, or that inestimable jewel to him (if he only\\nknew it) the Constitution, should be strange! His whole material and\\nimmaterial life is wonderfully strange; his death, the strangest\\nthing of all.\\n\\nJo comes out of Tom-all-Alone\\'s, meeting the tardy morning which is\\nalways late in getting down there, and munches his dirty bit of bread\\nas he comes along. His way lying through many streets, and the houses\\nnot yet being open, he sits down to breakfast on the door-step of the\\nSociety for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and gives\\nit a brush when he has finished as an acknowledgment of the\\naccommodation. He admires the size of the edifice and wonders what\\nit\\'s all about. He has no idea, poor wretch, of the spiritual\\ndestitution of a coral reef in the Pacific or what it costs to look\\nup the precious souls among the coco-nuts and bread-fruit.\\n\\nHe goes to his crossing and begins to lay it out for the day. The\\ntown awakes; the great tee-totum is set up for its daily spin and\\nwhirl; all that unaccountable reading and writing, which has been\\nsuspended for a few hours, recommences. Jo and the other lower\\nanimals get on in the unintelligible mess as they can. It is\\nmarket-day. The blinded oxen, over-goaded, over-driven, never guided,\\nrun into wrong places and are beaten out, and plunge red-eyed and\\nfoaming at stone walls, and often sorely hurt the innocent, and often\\nsorely hurt themselves. Very like Jo and his order; very, very like!\\n\\nA band of music comes and plays. Jo listens to it. So does a dog--a\\ndrover\\'s dog, waiting for his master outside a butcher\\'s shop, and\\nevidently thinking about those sheep he has had upon his mind for\\nsome hours and is happily rid of. He seems perplexed respecting three\\nor four, can\\'t remember where he left them, looks up and down the\\nstreet as half expecting to see them astray, suddenly pricks up his\\nears and remembers all about it. A thoroughly vagabond dog,\\naccustomed to low company and public-houses; a terrific dog to sheep,\\nready at a whistle to scamper over their backs and tear out mouthfuls\\nof their wool; but an educated, improved, developed dog who has been\\ntaught his duties and knows how to discharge them. He and Jo listen\\nto the music, probably with much the same amount of animal\\nsatisfaction; likewise as to awakened association, aspiration, or\\nregret, melancholy or joyful reference to things beyond the senses,\\nthey are probably upon a par. But, otherwise, how far above the human\\nlistener is the brute!\\n\\nTurn that dog\\'s descendants wild, like Jo, and in a very few years\\nthey will so degenerate that they will lose even their bark--but not\\ntheir bite.\\n\\nThe day changes as it wears itself away and becomes dark and drizzly.\\nJo fights it out at his crossing among the mud and wheels, the\\nhorses, whips, and umbrellas, and gets but a scanty sum to pay for\\nthe unsavoury shelter of Tom-all-Alone\\'s. Twilight comes on; gas\\nbegins to start up in the shops; the lamplighter, with his ladder,\\nruns along the margin of the pavement. A wretched evening is\\nbeginning to close in.\\n\\nIn his chambers Mr. Tulkinghorn sits meditating an application to the\\nnearest magistrate to-morrow morning for a warrant. Gridley, a\\ndisappointed suitor, has been here to-day and has been alarming. We\\nare not to be put in bodily fear, and that ill-conditioned fellow\\nshall be held to bail again. From the ceiling, foreshortened\\nAllegory, in the person of one impossible Roman upside down, points\\nwith the arm of Samson (out of joint, and an odd one) obtrusively\\ntoward the window. Why should Mr. Tulkinghorn, for such no reason,\\nlook out of window? Is the hand not always pointing there? So he does\\nnot look out of window.\\n\\nAnd if he did, what would it be to see a woman going by? There are\\nwomen enough in the world, Mr. Tulkinghorn thinks--too many; they are\\nat the bottom of all that goes wrong in it, though, for the matter of\\nthat, they create business for lawyers. What would it be to see a\\nwoman going by, even though she were going secretly? They are all\\nsecret. Mr. Tulkinghorn knows that very well.\\n\\nBut they are not all like the woman who now leaves him and his house\\nbehind, between whose plain dress and her refined manner there is\\nsomething exceedingly inconsistent. She should be an upper servant by\\nher attire, yet in her air and step, though both are hurried and\\nassumed--as far as she can assume in the muddy streets, which she\\ntreads with an unaccustomed foot--she is a lady. Her face is veiled,\\nand still she sufficiently betrays herself to make more than one of\\nthose who pass her look round sharply.\\n\\nShe never turns her head. Lady or servant, she has a purpose in her\\nand can follow it. She never turns her head until she comes to the\\ncrossing where Jo plies with his broom. He crosses with her and begs.\\nStill, she does not turn her head until she has landed on the other\\nside. Then she slightly beckons to him and says, \"Come here!\"\\n\\nJo follows her a pace or two into a quiet court.\\n\\n\"Are you the boy I\\'ve read of in the papers?\" she asked behind her\\nveil.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" says Jo, staring moodily at the veil, \"nothink about\\nno papers. I don\\'t know nothink about nothink at all.\"\\n\\n\"Were you examined at an inquest?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know nothink about no--where I was took by the beadle, do\\nyou mean?\" says Jo. \"Was the boy\\'s name at the inkwhich Jo?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s me!\" says Jo.\\n\\n\"Come farther up.\"\\n\\n\"You mean about the man?\" says Jo, following. \"Him as wos dead?\"\\n\\n\"Hush! Speak in a whisper! Yes. Did he look, when he was living, so\\nvery ill and poor?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, jist!\" says Jo.\\n\\n\"Did he look like--not like YOU?\" says the woman with abhorrence.\\n\\n\"Oh, not so bad as me,\" says Jo. \"I\\'m a reg\\'lar one I am! You didn\\'t\\nknow him, did you?\"\\n\\n\"How dare you ask me if I knew him?\"\\n\\n\"No offence, my lady,\" says Jo with much humility, for even he has\\ngot at the suspicion of her being a lady.\\n\\n\"I am not a lady. I am a servant.\"\\n\\n\"You are a jolly servant!\" says Jo without the least idea of saying\\nanything offensive, merely as a tribute of admiration.\\n\\n\"Listen and be silent. Don\\'t talk to me, and stand farther from me!\\nCan you show me all those places that were spoken of in the account I\\nread? The place he wrote for, the place he died at, the place where\\nyou were taken to, and the place where he was buried? Do you know the\\nplace where he was buried?\"\\n\\nJo answers with a nod, having also nodded as each other place was\\nmentioned.\\n\\n\"Go before me and show me all those dreadful places. Stop opposite to\\neach, and don\\'t speak to me unless I speak to you. Don\\'t look back.\\nDo what I want, and I will pay you well.\"\\n\\nJo attends closely while the words are being spoken; tells them off\\non his broom-handle, finding them rather hard; pauses to consider\\ntheir meaning; considers it satisfactory; and nods his ragged head.\\n\\n\"I\\'m fly,\" says Jo. \"But fen larks, you know. Stow hooking it!\"\\n\\n\"What does the horrible creature mean?\" exclaims the servant,\\nrecoiling from him.\\n\\n\"Stow cutting away, you know!\" says Jo.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand you. Go on before! I will give you more money\\nthan you ever had in your life.\"\\n\\nJo screws up his mouth into a whistle, gives his ragged head a rub,\\ntakes his broom under his arm, and leads the way, passing deftly with\\nhis bare feet over the hard stones and through the mud and mire.\\n\\nCook\\'s Court. Jo stops. A pause.\\n\\n\"Who lives here?\"\\n\\n\"Him wot give him his writing and give me half a bull,\" says Jo in a\\nwhisper without looking over his shoulder.\\n\\n\"Go on to the next.\"\\n\\nKrook\\'s house. Jo stops again. A longer pause.\\n\\n\"Who lives here?\"\\n\\n\"HE lived here,\" Jo answers as before.\\n\\nAfter a silence he is asked, \"In which room?\"\\n\\n\"In the back room up there. You can see the winder from this corner.\\nUp there! That\\'s where I see him stritched out. This is the\\npublic-ouse where I was took to.\"\\n\\n\"Go on to the next!\"\\n\\nIt is a longer walk to the next, but Jo, relieved of his first\\nsuspicions, sticks to the forms imposed upon him and does not look\\nround. By many devious ways, reeking with offence of many kinds, they\\ncome to the little tunnel of a court, and to the gas-lamp (lighted\\nnow), and to the iron gate.\\n\\n\"He was put there,\" says Jo, holding to the bars and looking in.\\n\\n\"Where? Oh, what a scene of horror!\"\\n\\n\"There!\" says Jo, pointing. \"Over yinder. Among them piles of bones,\\nand close to that there kitchin winder! They put him wery nigh the\\ntop. They was obliged to stamp upon it to git it in. I could unkiver\\nit for you with my broom if the gate was open. That\\'s why they locks\\nit, I s\\'pose,\" giving it a shake. \"It\\'s always locked. Look at the\\nrat!\" cries Jo, excited. \"Hi! Look! There he goes! Ho! Into the\\nground!\"\\n\\nThe servant shrinks into a corner, into a corner of that hideous\\narchway, with its deadly stains contaminating her dress; and putting\\nout her two hands and passionately telling him to keep away from her,\\nfor he is loathsome to her, so remains for some moments. Jo stands\\nstaring and is still staring when she recovers herself.\\n\\n\"Is this place of abomination consecrated ground?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know nothink of consequential ground,\" says Jo, still\\nstaring.\\n\\n\"Is it blessed?\"\\n\\n\"Which?\" says Jo, in the last degree amazed.\\n\\n\"Is it blessed?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m blest if I know,\" says Jo, staring more than ever; \"but I\\nshouldn\\'t think it warn\\'t. Blest?\" repeats Jo, something troubled in\\nhis mind. \"It an\\'t done it much good if it is. Blest? I should think\\nit was t\\'othered myself. But I don\\'t know nothink!\"\\n\\nThe servant takes as little heed of what he says as she seems to take\\nof what she has said herself. She draws off her glove to get some\\nmoney from her purse. Jo silently notices how white and small her\\nhand is and what a jolly servant she must be to wear such sparkling\\nrings.\\n\\nShe drops a piece of money in his hand without touching it, and\\nshuddering as their hands approach. \"Now,\" she adds, \"show me the\\nspot again!\"\\n\\nJo thrusts the handle of his broom between the bars of the gate, and\\nwith his utmost power of elaboration, points it out. At length,\\nlooking aside to see if he has made himself intelligible, he finds\\nthat he is alone.\\n\\nHis first proceeding is to hold the piece of money to the gas-light\\nand to be overpowered at finding that it is yellow--gold. His next is\\nto give it a one-sided bite at the edge as a test of its quality.\\nHis next, to put it in his mouth for safety and to sweep the\\nstep and passage with great care. His job done, he sets off for\\nTom-all-Alone\\'s, stopping in the light of innumerable gas-lamps to\\nproduce the piece of gold and give it another one-sided bite as a\\nreassurance of its being genuine.\\n\\nThe Mercury in powder is in no want of society to-night, for my Lady\\ngoes to a grand dinner and three or four balls.

Before breakfast, she proposes a walk, and all the young people agree. Esther again shows kindness to Peepy, washing him and putting him to sleep in her bed. Esther, Ada, Caddy, and Richard take their first walk about London.\\n\\nThey soon meet Miss Flite again, who begs them to come to her lodgings. They go and visit Krook\\'s rag-and-bottle shop, above which is Miss Flite\\'s room. As they enter, Esther sees a legal handwritten advertisement for Mr. Nemo, requesting work as a law writer (copyist). Neither Esther nor we yet know it, but she is looking at the handwriting of her father and entering the house where he lives.\\n\\nThe group meets Mr. Krook, who is obsessed with Chancery documents. He rambles on about the Jarndyce suit, mentioning the names Barbary, Clare, and Dedlock, giving Esther, unaware, two more names of her mysterious parentage. They see Miss Flite\\'s bare and sad room, and Richard surreptitiously leaves some money for her. They return to the Jellyby house, much affected by the sad states to which Chancery can reduce people.\\n\\nIn Chapter 6, the long awaited meeting with Mr. Jarndyce happens at his home, Bleak House. He is described as a handsome, robust man in his 50s -- exceedingly kindly, genteel, and self-effacing. He has a little quirk of mentioning the \"east wind\" whenever something he doesn\\'t like is brought up. The three young people instantly like and feel affection for their mutual benefactor.\\n\\nA \"perfect child\" is abruptly introduced -- the parasitic poet, Mr. Skimpole. The three young people are instantly brought into his inbroglios when the bailiff, a man called Neckett, arrives and demands payment of a debt. Richard and Esther come to the rescue, and, upon learning of it, Mr. Jarndyce warns them not to give money to Skimpole.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, Esther is given the keys to the household, the mark of the housekeeper of Bleak House. She is excited and honored to have this position. She sets up residence in a room adjoining Ada\\'s, with a sitting room in between, and everything in the house is to the young people\\'s liking.\\n\\nChapter 7 is back in Chesney Wold. Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock have left for Paris. The rain continues, and Mrs. Rouncewell, the aged housekeeper, is introduced. She is instructing a young village girl of considerable beauty in the ways of housekeeping and maid\\'s work in a great house. Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s grandson, Watt, who loves Rosa, is visiting.\\n\\nIn the midst of the rain a couple of visitors come to see the house, but are told it \"isn\\'t the day\". They persist, and are admitted, by using Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s name. Mr. Guppy and his friend are brought through the house, and Mr. Guppy admires a portrait of Lady Dedlock. He exclaims that he must have seen the subject somewhere before. Guppy, who had met Esther Summerson briefly in London at Kenge and Carboy\\'s, is unconsciously remembering Lady Dedlock\\'s resemblence to Esther. Guppy leaves a bit perplexed.\\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell had refused to tell the family ghost story, but now recounts it to her grandson and her charge, Rosa. The Ghost\\'s Walk is a terraced walk outside the house, and an eerie footstep is often heard echoing from it. It is supposed that two hundred years ago, a previous Lady Dedlock had sabotaged horses meant for Cavaliers fighting Cromwellian forces. She had lamed them, and, upon being discovered, was lamed herself by her husband in a struggle. She was limping on the terrace and fell and died, and she vowed to haunt the terrace until \"the pride of the house is tumbled.\" Watt and Rosa can still hear the phantom footsteps. ', 'text': 'Although the morning was raw, and although the fog still seemed\\nheavy--I say seemed, for the windows were so encrusted with dirt that\\nthey would have made midsummer sunshine dim--I was sufficiently\\nforewarned of the discomfort within doors at that early hour and\\nsufficiently curious about London to think it a good idea on the part\\nof Miss Jellyby when she proposed that we should go out for a walk.\\n\\n\"Ma won\\'t be down for ever so long,\" she said, \"and then it\\'s a\\nchance if breakfast\\'s ready for an hour afterwards, they dawdle so.\\nAs to Pa, he gets what he can and goes to the office. He never has\\nwhat you would call a regular breakfast. Priscilla leaves him out the\\nloaf and some milk, when there is any, overnight. Sometimes there\\nisn\\'t any milk, and sometimes the cat drinks it. But I\\'m afraid you\\nmust be tired, Miss Summerson, and perhaps you would rather go to\\nbed.\"\\n\\n\"I am not at all tired, my dear,\" said I, \"and would much prefer to\\ngo out.\"\\n\\n\"If you\\'re sure you would,\" returned Miss Jellyby, \"I\\'ll get my\\nthings on.\"\\n\\nAda said she would go too, and was soon astir. I made a proposal to\\nPeepy, in default of being able to do anything better for him, that\\nhe should let me wash him and afterwards lay him down on my bed\\nagain. To this he submitted with the best grace possible, staring at\\nme during the whole operation as if he never had been, and never\\ncould again be, so astonished in his life--looking very miserable\\nalso, certainly, but making no complaint, and going snugly to sleep\\nas soon as it was over. At first I was in two minds about taking such\\na liberty, but I soon reflected that nobody in the house was likely\\nto notice it.\\n\\nWhat with the bustle of dispatching Peepy and the bustle of getting\\nmyself ready and helping Ada, I was soon quite in a glow. We found\\nMiss Jellyby trying to warm herself at the fire in the writing-room,\\nwhich Priscilla was then lighting with a smutty parlour candlestick,\\nthrowing the candle in to make it burn better. Everything was just as\\nwe had left it last night and was evidently intended to remain so.\\nBelow-stairs the dinner-cloth had not been taken away, but had been\\nleft ready for breakfast. Crumbs, dust, and waste-paper were all over\\nthe house. Some pewter pots and a milk-can hung on the area railings;\\nthe door stood open; and we met the cook round the corner coming out\\nof a public-house, wiping her mouth. She mentioned, as she passed us,\\nthat she had been to see what o\\'clock it was.\\n\\nBut before we met the cook, we met Richard, who was dancing up and\\ndown Thavies Inn to warm his feet. He was agreeably surprised to see\\nus stirring so soon and said he would gladly share our walk. So he\\ntook care of Ada, and Miss Jellyby and I went first. I may mention\\nthat Miss Jellyby had relapsed into her sulky manner and that I\\nreally should not have thought she liked me much unless she had told\\nme so.\\n\\n\"Where would you wish to go?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Anywhere, my dear,\" I replied.\\n\\n\"Anywhere\\'s nowhere,\" said Miss Jellyby, stopping perversely.\\n\\n\"Let us go somewhere at any rate,\" said I.\\n\\nShe then walked me on very fast.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care!\" she said. \"Now, you are my witness, Miss Summerson, I\\nsay I don\\'t care--but if he was to come to our house with his great,\\nshining, lumpy forehead night after night till he was as old as\\nMethuselah, I wouldn\\'t have anything to say to him. Such ASSES as he\\nand Ma make of themselves!\"\\n\\n\"My dear!\" I remonstrated, in allusion to the epithet and the\\nvigorous emphasis Miss Jellyby set upon it. \"Your duty as a child--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Don\\'t talk of duty as a child, Miss Summerson; where\\'s Ma\\'s duty\\nas a parent? All made over to the public and Africa, I suppose! Then\\nlet the public and Africa show duty as a child; it\\'s much more their\\naffair than mine. You are shocked, I dare say! Very well, so am I\\nshocked too; so we are both shocked, and there\\'s an end of it!\"\\n\\nShe walked me on faster yet.\\n\\n\"But for all that, I say again, he may come, and come, and come, and\\nI won\\'t have anything to say to him. I can\\'t bear him. If there\\'s any\\nstuff in the world that I hate and detest, it\\'s the stuff he and Ma\\ntalk. I wonder the very paving-stones opposite our house can have the\\npatience to stay there and be a witness of such inconsistencies and\\ncontradictions as all that sounding nonsense, and Ma\\'s management!\"\\n\\nI could not but understand her to refer to Mr. Quale, the young\\ngentleman who had appeared after dinner yesterday. I was saved the\\ndisagreeable necessity of pursuing the subject by Richard and Ada\\ncoming up at a round pace, laughing and asking us if we meant to run\\na race. Thus interrupted, Miss Jellyby became silent and walked\\nmoodily on at my side while I admired the long successions and\\nvarieties of streets, the quantity of people already going to and\\nfro, the number of vehicles passing and repassing, the busy\\npreparations in the setting forth of shop windows and the sweeping\\nout of shops, and the extraordinary creatures in rags secretly\\ngroping among the swept-out rubbish for pins and other refuse.\\n\\n\"So, cousin,\" said the cheerful voice of Richard to Ada behind me.\\n\"We are never to get out of Chancery! We have come by another way to\\nour place of meeting yesterday, and--by the Great Seal, here\\'s the\\nold lady again!\"\\n\\nTruly, there she was, immediately in front of us, curtsying, and\\nsmiling, and saying with her yesterday\\'s air of patronage, \"The wards\\nin Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy, I am sure!\"\\n\\n\"You are out early, ma\\'am,\" said I as she curtsied to me.\\n\\n\"Ye-es! I usually walk here early. Before the court sits. It\\'s\\nretired. I collect my thoughts here for the business of the day,\"\\nsaid the old lady mincingly. \"The business of the day requires a\\ngreat deal of thought. Chancery justice is so ve-ry difficult to\\nfollow.\"\\n\\n\"Who\\'s this, Miss Summerson?\" whispered Miss Jellyby, drawing my arm\\ntighter through her own.\\n\\nThe little old lady\\'s hearing was remarkably quick. She answered for\\nherself directly.\\n\\n\"A suitor, my child. At your service. I have the honour to attend\\ncourt regularly. With my documents. Have I the pleasure of addressing\\nanother of the youthful parties in Jarndyce?\" said the old lady,\\nrecovering herself, with her head on one side, from a very low\\ncurtsy.\\n\\nRichard, anxious to atone for his thoughtlessness of yesterday,\\ngood-naturedly explained that Miss Jellyby was not connected with the\\nsuit.\\n\\n\"Ha!\" said the old lady. \"She does not expect a judgment? She will\\nstill grow old. But not so old. Oh, dear, no! This is the garden of\\nLincoln\\'s Inn. I call it my garden. It is quite a bower in the\\nsummer-time. Where the birds sing melodiously. I pass the greater\\npart of the long vacation here. In contemplation. You find the long\\nvacation exceedingly long, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\nWe said yes, as she seemed to expect us to say so.\\n\\n\"When the leaves are falling from the trees and there are no more\\nflowers in bloom to make up into nosegays for the Lord Chancellor\\'s\\ncourt,\" said the old lady, \"the vacation is fulfilled and the sixth\\nseal, mentioned in the Revelations, again prevails. Pray come and see\\nmy lodging. It will be a good omen for me. Youth, and hope, and\\nbeauty are very seldom there. It is a long, long time since I had a\\nvisit from either.\"\\n\\nShe had taken my hand, and leading me and Miss Jellyby away, beckoned\\nRichard and Ada to come too. I did not know how to excuse myself and\\nlooked to Richard for aid. As he was half amused and half curious and\\nall in doubt how to get rid of the old lady without offence, she\\ncontinued to lead us away, and he and Ada continued to follow, our\\nstrange conductress informing us all the time, with much smiling\\ncondescension, that she lived close by.\\n\\nIt was quite true, as it soon appeared. She lived so close by that we\\nhad not time to have done humouring her for a few moments before she\\nwas at home. Slipping us out at a little side gate, the old lady\\nstopped most unexpectedly in a narrow back street, part of some\\ncourts and lanes immediately outside the wall of the inn, and said,\\n\"This is my lodging. Pray walk up!\"\\n\\nShe had stopped at a shop over which was written KROOK, RAG AND\\nBOTTLE WAREHOUSE. Also, in long thin letters, KROOK, DEALER IN MARINE\\nSTORES. In one part of the window was a picture of a red paper mill\\nat which a cart was unloading a quantity of sacks of old rags. In\\nanother was the inscription BONES BOUGHT. In another, KITCHEN-STUFF\\nBOUGHT. In another, OLD IRON BOUGHT. In another, WASTE-PAPER BOUGHT.\\nIn another, LADIES\\' AND GENTLEMEN\\'S WARDROBES BOUGHT. Everything\\nseemed to be bought and nothing to be sold there. In all parts of the\\nwindow were quantities of dirty bottles--blacking bottles, medicine\\nbottles, ginger-beer and soda-water bottles, pickle bottles, wine\\nbottles, ink bottles; I am reminded by mentioning the latter that the\\nshop had in several little particulars the air of being in a legal\\nneighbourhood and of being, as it were, a dirty hanger-on and\\ndisowned relation of the law. There were a great many ink bottles.\\nThere was a little tottering bench of shabby old volumes outside the\\ndoor, labelled \"Law Books, all at 9d.\" Some of the inscriptions I\\nhave enumerated were written in law-hand, like the papers I had seen\\nin Kenge and Carboy\\'s office and the letters I had so long received\\nfrom the firm. Among them was one, in the same writing, having\\nnothing to do with the business of the shop, but announcing that a\\nrespectable man aged forty-five wanted engrossing or copying to\\nexecute with neatness and dispatch: Address to Nemo, care of Mr.\\nKrook, within. There were several second-hand bags, blue and red,\\nhanging up. A little way within the shop-door lay heaps of old\\ncrackled parchment scrolls and discoloured and dog\\'s-eared\\nlaw-papers. I could have fancied that all the rusty keys, of which\\nthere must have been hundreds huddled together as old iron, had once\\nbelonged to doors of rooms or strong chests in lawyers\\' offices. The\\nlitter of rags tumbled partly into and partly out of a one-legged\\nwooden scale, hanging without any counterpoise from a beam, might\\nhave been counsellors\\' bands and gowns torn up. One had only to\\nfancy, as Richard whispered to Ada and me while we all stood looking\\nin, that yonder bones in a corner, piled together and picked very\\nclean, were the bones of clients, to make the picture complete.\\n\\nAs it was still foggy and dark, and as the shop was blinded besides\\nby the wall of Lincoln\\'s Inn, intercepting the light within a couple\\nof yards, we should not have seen so much but for a lighted lantern\\nthat an old man in spectacles and a hairy cap was carrying about in\\nthe shop. Turning towards the door, he now caught sight of us. He was\\nshort, cadaverous, and withered, with his head sunk sideways between\\nhis shoulders and the breath issuing in visible smoke from his mouth\\nas if he were on fire within. His throat, chin, and eyebrows were so\\nfrosted with white hairs and so gnarled with veins and puckered skin\\nthat he looked from his breast upward like some old root in a fall of\\nsnow.\\n\\n\"Hi, hi!\" said the old man, coming to the door. \"Have you anything to\\nsell?\"\\n\\nWe naturally drew back and glanced at our conductress, who had been\\ntrying to open the house-door with a key she had taken from her\\npocket, and to whom Richard now said that as we had had the pleasure\\nof seeing where she lived, we would leave her, being pressed for\\ntime. But she was not to be so easily left. She became so\\nfantastically and pressingly earnest in her entreaties that we would\\nwalk up and see her apartment for an instant, and was so bent, in her\\nharmless way, on leading me in, as part of the good omen she desired,\\nthat I (whatever the others might do) saw nothing for it but to\\ncomply. I suppose we were all more or less curious; at any rate, when\\nthe old man added his persuasions to hers and said, \"Aye, aye! Please\\nher! It won\\'t take a minute! Come in, come in! Come in through the\\nshop if t\\'other door\\'s out of order!\" we all went in, stimulated by\\nRichard\\'s laughing encouragement and relying on his protection.\\n\\n\"My landlord, Krook,\" said the little old lady, condescending to him\\nfrom her lofty station as she presented him to us. \"He is called\\namong the neighbours the Lord Chancellor. His shop is called the\\nCourt of Chancery. He is a very eccentric person. He is very odd. Oh,\\nI assure you he is very odd!\"\\n\\nShe shook her head a great many times and tapped her forehead with\\nher finger to express to us that we must have the goodness to excuse\\nhim, \"For he is a little--you know--M!\" said the old lady with great\\nstateliness. The old man overheard, and laughed.\\n\\n\"It\\'s true enough,\" he said, going before us with the lantern, \"that\\nthey call me the Lord Chancellor and call my shop Chancery. And why\\ndo you think they call me the Lord Chancellor and my shop Chancery?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, I am sure!\" said Richard rather carelessly.\\n\\n\"You see,\" said the old man, stopping and turning round, \"they--Hi!\\nHere\\'s lovely hair! I have got three sacks of ladies\\' hair below, but\\nnone so beautiful and fine as this. What colour, and what texture!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'ll do, my good friend!\" said Richard, strongly disapproving of\\nhis having drawn one of Ada\\'s tresses through his yellow hand. \"You\\ncan admire as the rest of us do without taking that liberty.\"\\n\\nThe old man darted at him a sudden look which even called my\\nattention from Ada, who, startled and blushing, was so remarkably\\nbeautiful that she seemed to fix the wandering attention of the\\nlittle old lady herself. But as Ada interposed and laughingly said\\nshe could only feel proud of such genuine admiration, Mr. Krook\\nshrunk into his former self as suddenly as he had leaped out of it.\\n\\n\"You see, I have so many things here,\" he resumed, holding up the\\nlantern, \"of so many kinds, and all as the neighbours think (but THEY\\nknow nothing), wasting away and going to rack and ruin, that that\\'s\\nwhy they have given me and my place a christening. And I have so many\\nold parchmentses and papers in my stock. And I have a liking for rust\\nand must and cobwebs. And all\\'s fish that comes to my net. And I\\ncan\\'t abear to part with anything I once lay hold of (or so my\\nneighbours think, but what do THEY know?) or to alter anything, or to\\nhave any sweeping, nor scouring, nor cleaning, nor repairing going on\\nabout me. That\\'s the way I\\'ve got the ill name of Chancery. I don\\'t\\nmind. I go to see my noble and learned brother pretty well every day,\\nwhen he sits in the Inn. He don\\'t notice me, but I notice him.\\nThere\\'s no great odds betwixt us. We both grub on in a muddle. Hi,\\nLady Jane!\"\\n\\nA large grey cat leaped from some neighbouring shelf on his shoulder\\nand startled us all.\\n\\n\"Hi! Show \\'em how you scratch. Hi! Tear, my lady!\" said her master.\\n\\nThe cat leaped down and ripped at a bundle of rags with her tigerish\\nclaws, with a sound that it set my teeth on edge to hear.\\n\\n\"She\\'d do as much for any one I was to set her on,\" said the old man.\\n\"I deal in cat-skins among other general matters, and hers was\\noffered to me. It\\'s a very fine skin, as you may see, but I didn\\'t\\nhave it stripped off! THAT warn\\'t like Chancery practice though, says\\nyou!\"\\n\\nHe had by this time led us across the shop, and now opened a door in\\nthe back part of it, leading to the house-entry. As he stood with his\\nhand upon the lock, the little old lady graciously observed to him\\nbefore passing out, \"That will do, Krook. You mean well, but are\\ntiresome. My young friends are pressed for time. I have none to spare\\nmyself, having to attend court very soon. My young friends are the\\nwards in Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Jarndyce!\" said the old man with a start.\\n\\n\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The great suit, Krook,\" returned his lodger.\\n\\n\"Hi!\" exclaimed the old man in a tone of thoughtful amazement and\\nwith a wider stare than before. \"Think of it!\"\\n\\nHe seemed so rapt all in a moment and looked so curiously at us that\\nRichard said, \"Why, you appear to trouble yourself a good deal about\\nthe causes before your noble and learned brother, the other\\nChancellor!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the old man abstractedly. \"Sure! YOUR name now will be--\"\\n\\n\"Richard Carstone.\"\\n\\n\"Carstone,\" he repeated, slowly checking off that name upon his\\nforefinger; and each of the others he went on to mention upon a\\nseparate finger. \"Yes. There was the name of Barbary, and the name of\\nClare, and the name of Dedlock, too, I think.\"\\n\\n\"He knows as much of the cause as the real salaried Chancellor!\" said\\nRichard, quite astonished, to Ada and me.\\n\\n\"Aye!\" said the old man, coming slowly out of his abstraction. \"Yes!\\nTom Jarndyce--you\\'ll excuse me, being related; but he was never known\\nabout court by any other name, and was as well known there as--she is\\nnow,\" nodding slightly at his lodger. \"Tom Jarndyce was often in\\nhere. He got into a restless habit of strolling about when the cause\\nwas on, or expected, talking to the little shopkeepers and telling\\n\\'em to keep out of Chancery, whatever they did. \\'For,\\' says he, \\'it\\'s\\nbeing ground to bits in a slow mill; it\\'s being roasted at a slow\\nfire; it\\'s being stung to death by single bees; it\\'s being drowned by\\ndrops; it\\'s going mad by grains.\\' He was as near making away with\\nhimself, just where the young lady stands, as near could be.\"\\n\\nWe listened with horror.\\n\\n\"He come in at the door,\" said the old man, slowly pointing an\\nimaginary track along the shop, \"on the day he did it--the whole\\nneighbourhood had said for months before that he would do it, of a\\ncertainty sooner or later--he come in at the door that day, and\\nwalked along there, and sat himself on a bench that stood there, and\\nasked me (you\\'ll judge I was a mortal sight younger then) to fetch\\nhim a pint of wine. \\'For,\\' says he, \\'Krook, I am much depressed; my\\ncause is on again, and I think I\\'m nearer judgment than I ever was.\\'\\nI hadn\\'t a mind to leave him alone; and I persuaded him to go to the\\ntavern over the way there, t\\'other side my lane (I mean Chancery\\nLane); and I followed and looked in at the window, and saw him,\\ncomfortable as I thought, in the arm-chair by the fire, and company\\nwith him. I hadn\\'t hardly got back here when I heard a shot go\\nechoing and rattling right away into the inn. I ran out--neighbours\\nran out--twenty of us cried at once, \\'Tom Jarndyce!\\'\"\\n\\nThe old man stopped, looked hard at us, looked down into the lantern,\\nblew the light out, and shut the lantern up.\\n\\n\"We were right, I needn\\'t tell the present hearers. Hi! To be sure,\\nhow the neighbourhood poured into court that afternoon while the\\ncause was on! How my noble and learned brother, and all the rest of\\n\\'em, grubbed and muddled away as usual and tried to look as if they\\nhadn\\'t heard a word of the last fact in the case or as if they\\nhad--Oh, dear me!--nothing at all to do with it if they had heard of\\nit by any chance!\"\\n\\nAda\\'s colour had entirely left her, and Richard was scarcely less\\npale. Nor could I wonder, judging even from my emotions, and I was no\\nparty in the suit, that to hearts so untried and fresh it was a shock\\nto come into the inheritance of a protracted misery, attended in the\\nminds of many people with such dreadful recollections. I had another\\nuneasiness, in the application of the painful story to the poor\\nhalf-witted creature who had brought us there; but, to my surprise,\\nshe seemed perfectly unconscious of that and only led the way\\nupstairs again, informing us with the toleration of a superior\\ncreature for the infirmities of a common mortal that her landlord was\\n\"a little M, you know!\"\\n\\nShe lived at the top of the house, in a pretty large room, from which\\nshe had a glimpse of Lincoln\\'s Inn Hall. This seemed to have been her\\nprincipal inducement, originally, for taking up her residence there.\\nShe could look at it, she said, in the night, especially in the\\nmoonshine. Her room was clean, but very, very bare. I noticed the\\nscantiest necessaries in the way of furniture; a few old prints from\\nbooks, of Chancellors and barristers, wafered against the wall; and\\nsome half-dozen reticles and work-bags, \"containing documents,\" as\\nshe informed us. There were neither coals nor ashes in the grate, and\\nI saw no articles of clothing anywhere, nor any kind of food. Upon a\\nshelf in an open cupboard were a plate or two, a cup or two, and so\\nforth, but all dry and empty. There was a more affecting meaning in\\nher pinched appearance, I thought as I looked round, than I had\\nunderstood before.\\n\\n\"Extremely honoured, I am sure,\" said our poor hostess with the\\ngreatest suavity, \"by this visit from the wards in Jarndyce. And very\\nmuch indebted for the omen. It is a retired situation. Considering. I\\nam limited as to situation. In consequence of the necessity of\\nattending on the Chancellor. I have lived here many years. I pass my\\ndays in court, my evenings and my nights here. I find the nights\\nlong, for I sleep but little and think much. That is, of course,\\nunavoidable, being in Chancery. I am sorry I cannot offer chocolate.\\nI expect a judgment shortly and shall then place my establishment on\\na superior footing. At present, I don\\'t mind confessing to the wards\\nin Jarndyce (in strict confidence) that I sometimes find it difficult\\nto keep up a genteel appearance. I have felt the cold here. I have\\nfelt something sharper than cold. It matters very little. Pray excuse\\nthe introduction of such mean topics.\"\\n\\nShe partly drew aside the curtain of the long, low garret window and\\ncalled our attention to a number of bird-cages hanging there, some\\ncontaining several birds. There were larks, linnets, and\\ngoldfinches--I should think at least twenty.\\n\\n\"I began to keep the little creatures,\" she said, \"with an object\\nthat the wards will readily comprehend. With the intention of\\nrestoring them to liberty. When my judgment should be given. Ye-es!\\nThey die in prison, though. Their lives, poor silly things, are so\\nshort in comparison with Chancery proceedings that, one by one, the\\nwhole collection has died over and over again. I doubt, do you know,\\nwhether one of these, though they are all young, will live to be\\nfree! Ve-ry mortifying, is it not?\"\\n\\nAlthough she sometimes asked a question, she never seemed to expect a\\nreply, but rambled on as if she were in the habit of doing so when no\\none but herself was present.\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" she pursued, \"I positively doubt sometimes, I do assure\\nyou, whether while matters are still unsettled, and the sixth or\\nGreat Seal still prevails, I may not one day be found lying stark and\\nsenseless here, as I have found so many birds!\"\\n\\nRichard, answering what he saw in Ada\\'s compassionate eyes, took the\\nopportunity of laying some money, softly and unobserved, on the\\nchimney-piece. We all drew nearer to the cages, feigning to examine\\nthe birds.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t allow them to sing much,\" said the little old lady, \"for\\n(you\\'ll think this curious) I find my mind confused by the idea that\\nthey are singing while I am following the arguments in court. And my\\nmind requires to be so very clear, you know! Another time, I\\'ll tell\\nyou their names. Not at present. On a day of such good omen, they\\nshall sing as much as they like. In honour of youth,\" a smile and\\ncurtsy, \"hope,\" a smile and curtsy, \"and beauty,\" a smile and curtsy.\\n\"There! We\\'ll let in the full light.\"\\n\\nThe birds began to stir and chirp.\\n\\n\"I cannot admit the air freely,\" said the little old lady--the room\\nwas close, and would have been the better for it--\"because the cat\\nyou saw downstairs, called Lady Jane, is greedy for their lives. She\\ncrouches on the parapet outside for hours and hours. I have\\ndiscovered,\" whispering mysteriously, \"that her natural cruelty is\\nsharpened by a jealous fear of their regaining their liberty. In\\nconsequence of the judgment I expect being shortly given. She is sly\\nand full of malice. I half believe, sometimes, that she is no cat,\\nbut the wolf of the old saying. It is so very difficult to keep her\\nfrom the door.\"\\n\\nSome neighbouring bells, reminding the poor soul that it was\\nhalf-past nine, did more for us in the way of bringing our visit to\\nan end than we could easily have done for ourselves. She hurriedly\\ntook up her little bag of documents, which she had laid upon the\\ntable on coming in, and asked if we were also going into court. On\\nour answering no, and that we would on no account detain her, she\\nopened the door to attend us downstairs.\\n\\n\"With such an omen, it is even more necessary than usual that I\\nshould be there before the Chancellor comes in,\" said she, \"for he\\nmight mention my case the first thing. I have a presentiment that he\\nWILL mention it the first thing this morning.\"\\n\\nShe stopped to tell us in a whisper as we were going down that the\\nwhole house was filled with strange lumber which her landlord had\\nbought piecemeal and had no wish to sell, in consequence of being a\\nlittle M. This was on the first floor. But she had made a previous\\nstoppage on the second floor and had silently pointed at a dark door\\nthere.\\n\\n\"The only other lodger,\" she now whispered in explanation, \"a\\nlaw-writer. The children in the lanes here say he has sold himself to\\nthe devil. I don\\'t know what he can have done with the money. Hush!\"\\n\\nShe appeared to mistrust that the lodger might hear her even there,\\nand repeating \"Hush!\" went before us on tiptoe as though even the\\nsound of her footsteps might reveal to him what she had said.\\n\\nPassing through the shop on our way out, as we had passed through it\\non our way in, we found the old man storing a quantity of packets of\\nwaste-paper in a kind of well in the floor. He seemed to be working\\nhard, with the perspiration standing on his forehead, and had a piece\\nof chalk by him, with which, as he put each separate package or\\nbundle down, he made a crooked mark on the panelling of the wall.\\n\\nRichard and Ada, and Miss Jellyby, and the little old lady had gone\\nby him, and I was going when he touched me on the arm to stay me, and\\nchalked the letter J upon the wall--in a very curious manner,\\nbeginning with the end of the letter and shaping it backward. It was\\na capital letter, not a printed one, but just such a letter as any\\nclerk in Messrs. Kenge and Carboy\\'s office would have made.\\n\\n\"Can you read it?\" he asked me with a keen glance.\\n\\n\"Surely,\" said I. \"It\\'s very plain.\"\\n\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\\n\"J.\"\\n\\nWith another glance at me, and a glance at the door, he rubbed it out\\nand turned an \"a\" in its place (not a capital letter this time), and\\nsaid, \"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\nI told him. He then rubbed that out and turned the letter \"r,\" and\\nasked me the same question. He went on quickly until he had formed in\\nthe same curious manner, beginning at the ends and bottoms of the\\nletters, the word Jarndyce, without once leaving two letters on the\\nwall together.\\n\\n\"What does that spell?\" he asked me.\\n\\nWhen I told him, he laughed. In the same odd way, yet with the same\\nrapidity, he then produced singly, and rubbed out singly, the letters\\nforming the words Bleak House. These, in some astonishment, I also\\nread; and he laughed again.\\n\\n\"Hi!\" said the old man, laying aside the chalk. \"I have a turn for\\ncopying from memory, you see, miss, though I can neither read nor\\nwrite.\"\\n\\nHe looked so disagreeable and his cat looked so wickedly at me, as if\\nI were a blood-relation of the birds upstairs, that I was quite\\nrelieved by Richard\\'s appearing at the door and saying, \"Miss\\nSummerson, I hope you are not bargaining for the sale of your hair.\\nDon\\'t be tempted. Three sacks below are quite enough for Mr. Krook!\"\\n\\nI lost no time in wishing Mr. Krook good morning and joining my\\nfriends outside, where we parted with the little old lady, who gave\\nus her blessing with great ceremony and renewed her assurance of\\nyesterday in reference to her intention of settling estates on Ada\\nand me. Before we finally turned out of those lanes, we looked back\\nand saw Mr. Krook standing at his shop-door, in his spectacles,\\nlooking after us, with his cat upon his shoulder, and her tail\\nsticking up on one side of his hairy cap like a tall feather.\\n\\n\"Quite an adventure for a morning in London!\" said Richard with a\\nsigh. \"Ah, cousin, cousin, it\\'s a weary word this Chancery!\"\\n\\n\"It is to me, and has been ever since I can remember,\" returned Ada.\\n\"I am grieved that I should be the enemy--as I suppose I am--of a\\ngreat number of relations and others, and that they should be my\\nenemies--as I suppose they are--and that we should all be ruining one\\nanother without knowing how or why and be in constant doubt and\\ndiscord all our lives. It seems very strange, as there must be right\\nsomewhere, that an honest judge in real earnest has not been able to\\nfind out through all these years where it is.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, cousin!\" said Richard. \"Strange, indeed! All this wasteful,\\nwanton chess-playing IS very strange. To see that composed court\\nyesterday jogging on so serenely and to think of the wretchedness of\\nthe pieces on the board gave me the headache and the heartache both\\ntogether. My head ached with wondering how it happened, if men were\\nneither fools nor rascals; and my heart ached to think they could\\npossibly be either. But at all events, Ada--I may call you Ada?\"\\n\\n\"Of course you may, cousin Richard.\"\\n\\n\"At all events, Chancery will work none of its bad influences on US.\\nWe have happily been brought together, thanks to our good kinsman,\\nand it can\\'t divide us now!\"\\n\\n\"Never, I hope, cousin Richard!\" said Ada gently.\\n\\nMiss Jellyby gave my arm a squeeze and me a very significant look. I\\nsmiled in return, and we made the rest of the way back very\\npleasantly.\\n\\nIn half an hour after our arrival, Mrs. Jellyby appeared; and in the\\ncourse of an hour the various things necessary for breakfast\\nstraggled one by one into the dining-room. I do not doubt that Mrs.\\nJellyby had gone to bed and got up in the usual manner, but she\\npresented no appearance of having changed her dress. She was greatly\\noccupied during breakfast, for the morning\\'s post brought a heavy\\ncorrespondence relative to Borrioboola-Gha, which would occasion her\\n(she said) to pass a busy day. The children tumbled about, and\\nnotched memoranda of their accidents in their legs, which were\\nperfect little calendars of distress; and Peepy was lost for an hour\\nand a half, and brought home from Newgate market by a policeman. The\\nequable manner in which Mrs. Jellyby sustained both his absence and\\nhis restoration to the family circle surprised us all.\\n\\nShe was by that time perseveringly dictating to Caddy, and Caddy was\\nfast relapsing into the inky condition in which we had found her. At\\none o\\'clock an open carriage arrived for us, and a cart for our\\nluggage. Mrs. Jellyby charged us with many remembrances to her good\\nfriend Mr. Jarndyce; Caddy left her desk to see us depart, kissed me\\nin the passage, and stood biting her pen and sobbing on the steps;\\nPeepy, I am happy to say, was asleep and spared the pain of\\nseparation (I was not without misgivings that he had gone to Newgate\\nmarket in search of me); and all the other children got up behind the\\nbarouche and fell off, and we saw them, with great concern, scattered\\nover the surface of Thavies Inn as we rolled out of its precincts.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe day had brightened very much, and still brightened as we went\\nwestward. We went our way through the sunshine and the fresh air,\\nwondering more and more at the extent of the streets, the brilliancy\\nof the shops, the great traffic, and the crowds of people whom the\\npleasanter weather seemed to have brought out like many-coloured\\nflowers. By and by we began to leave the wonderful city and to\\nproceed through suburbs which, of themselves, would have made a\\npretty large town in my eyes; and at last we got into a real country\\nroad again, with windmills, rick-yards, milestones, farmers\\' waggons,\\nscents of old hay, swinging signs, and horse troughs: trees, fields,\\nand hedge-rows. It was delightful to see the green landscape before\\nus and the immense metropolis behind; and when a waggon with a train\\nof beautiful horses, furnished with red trappings and clear-sounding\\nbells, came by us with its music, I believe we could all three have\\nsung to the bells, so cheerful were the influences around.\\n\\n\"The whole road has been reminding me of my namesake Whittington,\"\\nsaid Richard, \"and that waggon is the finishing touch. Halloa! What\\'s\\nthe matter?\"\\n\\nWe had stopped, and the waggon had stopped too. Its music changed as\\nthe horses came to a stand, and subsided to a gentle tinkling, except\\nwhen a horse tossed his head or shook himself and sprinkled off a\\nlittle shower of bell-ringing.\\n\\n\"Our postilion is looking after the waggoner,\" said Richard, \"and the\\nwaggoner is coming back after us. Good day, friend!\" The waggoner was\\nat our coach-door. \"Why, here\\'s an extraordinary thing!\" added\\nRichard, looking closely at the man. \"He has got your name, Ada, in\\nhis hat!\"\\n\\nHe had all our names in his hat. Tucked within the band were three\\nsmall notes--one addressed to Ada, one to Richard, one to me. These\\nthe waggoner delivered to each of us respectively, reading the name\\naloud first. In answer to Richard\\'s inquiry from whom they came, he\\nbriefly answered, \"Master, sir, if you please\"; and putting on his\\nhat again (which was like a soft bowl), cracked his whip, re-awakened\\nhis music, and went melodiously away.\\n\\n\"Is that Mr. Jarndyce\\'s waggon?\" said Richard, calling to our\\npost-boy.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" he replied. \"Going to London.\"\\n\\nWe opened the notes. Each was a counterpart of the other and\\ncontained these words in a solid, plain hand.\\n\\n\\n   I look forward, my dear, to our meeting easily and\\n   without constraint on either side. I therefore have to\\n   propose that we meet as old friends and take the past for\\n   granted. It will be a relief to you possibly, and to me\\n   certainly, and so my love to you.\\n\\n   John Jarndyce\\n\\n\\nI had perhaps less reason to be surprised than either of my\\ncompanions, having never yet enjoyed an opportunity of thanking one\\nwho had been my benefactor and sole earthly dependence through so\\nmany years. I had not considered how I could thank him, my gratitude\\nlying too deep in my heart for that; but I now began to consider how\\nI could meet him without thanking him, and felt it would be very\\ndifficult indeed.\\n\\nThe notes revived in Richard and Ada a general impression that they\\nboth had, without quite knowing how they came by it, that their\\ncousin Jarndyce could never bear acknowledgments for any kindness he\\nperformed and that sooner than receive any he would resort to the\\nmost singular expedients and evasions or would even run away. Ada\\ndimly remembered to have heard her mother tell, when she was a very\\nlittle child, that he had once done her an act of uncommon generosity\\nand that on her going to his house to thank him, he happened to see\\nher through a window coming to the door, and immediately escaped by\\nthe back gate, and was not heard of for three months. This discourse\\nled to a great deal more on the same theme, and indeed it lasted us\\nall day, and we talked of scarcely anything else. If we did by any\\nchance diverge into another subject, we soon returned to this, and\\nwondered what the house would be like, and when we should get there,\\nand whether we should see Mr. Jarndyce as soon as we arrived or after\\na delay, and what he would say to us, and what we should say to him.\\nAll of which we wondered about, over and over again.\\n\\nThe roads were very heavy for the horses, but the pathway was\\ngenerally good, so we alighted and walked up all the hills, and liked\\nit so well that we prolonged our walk on the level ground when we got\\nto the top. At Barnet there were other horses waiting for us, but as\\nthey had only just been fed, we had to wait for them too, and got a\\nlong fresh walk over a common and an old battle-field before the\\ncarriage came up. These delays so protracted the journey that the\\nshort day was spent and the long night had closed in before we came\\nto St. Albans, near to which town Bleak House was, we knew.\\n\\nBy that time we were so anxious and nervous that even Richard\\nconfessed, as we rattled over the stones of the old street, to\\nfeeling an irrational desire to drive back again. As to Ada and me,\\nwhom he had wrapped up with great care, the night being sharp and\\nfrosty, we trembled from head to foot. When we turned out of the\\ntown, round a corner, and Richard told us that the post-boy, who had\\nfor a long time sympathized with our heightened expectation, was\\nlooking back and nodding, we both stood up in the carriage (Richard\\nholding Ada lest she should be jolted down) and gazed round upon the\\nopen country and the starlight night for our destination. There was a\\nlight sparkling on the top of a hill before us, and the driver,\\npointing to it with his whip and crying, \"That\\'s Bleak House!\" put\\nhis horses into a canter and took us forward at such a rate, uphill\\nthough it was, that the wheels sent the road drift flying about our\\nheads like spray from a water-mill. Presently we lost the light,\\npresently saw it, presently lost it, presently saw it, and turned\\ninto an avenue of trees and cantered up towards where it was beaming\\nbrightly. It was in a window of what seemed to be an old-fashioned\\nhouse with three peaks in the roof in front and a circular sweep\\nleading to the porch. A bell was rung as we drew up, and amidst the\\nsound of its deep voice in the still air, and the distant barking of\\nsome dogs, and a gush of light from the opened door, and the smoking\\nand steaming of the heated horses, and the quickened beating of our\\nown hearts, we alighted in no inconsiderable confusion.\\n\\n\"Ada, my love, Esther, my dear, you are welcome. I rejoice to see\\nyou! Rick, if I had a hand to spare at present, I would give it you!\"\\n\\nThe gentleman who said these words in a clear, bright, hospitable\\nvoice had one of his arms round Ada\\'s waist and the other round mine,\\nand kissed us both in a fatherly way, and bore us across the hall\\ninto a ruddy little room, all in a glow with a blazing fire. Here he\\nkissed us again, and opening his arms, made us sit down side by side\\non a sofa ready drawn out near the hearth. I felt that if we had been\\nat all demonstrative, he would have run away in a moment.\\n\\n\"Now, Rick!\" said he. \"I have a hand at liberty. A word in earnest is\\nas good as a speech. I am heartily glad to see you. You are at home.\\nWarm yourself!\"\\n\\nRichard shook him by both hands with an intuitive mixture of respect\\nand frankness, and only saying (though with an earnestness that\\nrather alarmed me, I was so afraid of Mr. Jarndyce\\'s suddenly\\ndisappearing), \"You are very kind, sir! We are very much obliged to\\nyou!\" laid aside his hat and coat and came up to the fire.\\n\\n\"And how did you like the ride? And how did you like Mrs. Jellyby, my\\ndear?\" said Mr. Jarndyce to Ada.\\n\\nWhile Ada was speaking to him in reply, I glanced (I need not say\\nwith how much interest) at his face. It was a handsome, lively, quick\\nface, full of change and motion; and his hair was a silvered\\niron-grey. I took him to be nearer sixty than fifty, but he was\\nupright, hearty, and robust. From the moment of his first speaking to\\nus his voice had connected itself with an association in my mind that\\nI could not define; but now, all at once, a something sudden in his\\nmanner and a pleasant expression in his eyes recalled the gentleman\\nin the stagecoach six years ago on the memorable day of my journey to\\nReading. I was certain it was he. I never was so frightened in my\\nlife as when I made the discovery, for he caught my glance, and\\nappearing to read my thoughts, gave such a look at the door that I\\nthought we had lost him.\\n\\nHowever, I am happy to say he remained where he was, and asked me\\nwhat I thought of Mrs. Jellyby.\\n\\n\"She exerts herself very much for Africa, sir,\" I said.\\n\\n\"Nobly!\" returned Mr. Jarndyce. \"But you answer like Ada.\" Whom I had\\nnot heard. \"You all think something else, I see.\"\\n\\n\"We rather thought,\" said I, glancing at Richard and Ada, who\\nentreated me with their eyes to speak, \"that perhaps she was a little\\nunmindful of her home.\"\\n\\n\"Floored!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\nI was rather alarmed again.\\n\\n\"Well! I want to know your real thoughts, my dear. I may have sent\\nyou there on purpose.\"\\n\\n\"We thought that, perhaps,\" said I, hesitating, \"it is right to begin\\nwith the obligations of home, sir; and that, perhaps, while those are\\noverlooked and neglected, no other duties can possibly be substituted\\nfor them.\"\\n\\n\"The little Jellybys,\" said Richard, coming to my relief, \"are\\nreally--I can\\'t help expressing myself strongly, sir--in a devil of a\\nstate.\"\\n\\n\"She means well,\" said Mr. Jarndyce hastily. \"The wind\\'s in the\\neast.\"\\n\\n\"It was in the north, sir, as we came down,\" observed Richard.\\n\\n\"My dear Rick,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, poking the fire, \"I\\'ll take an\\noath it\\'s either in the east or going to be. I am always conscious of\\nan uncomfortable sensation now and then when the wind is blowing in\\nthe east.\"\\n\\n\"Rheumatism, sir?\" said Richard.\\n\\n\"I dare say it is, Rick. I believe it is. And so the little Jell--I\\nhad my doubts about \\'em--are in a--oh, Lord, yes, it\\'s easterly!\"\\nsaid Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\nHe had taken two or three undecided turns up and down while uttering\\nthese broken sentences, retaining the poker in one hand and rubbing\\nhis hair with the other, with a good-natured vexation at once so\\nwhimsical and so lovable that I am sure we were more delighted with\\nhim than we could possibly have expressed in any words. He gave an\\narm to Ada and an arm to me, and bidding Richard bring a candle, was\\nleading the way out when he suddenly turned us all back again.\\n\\n\"Those little Jellybys. Couldn\\'t you--didn\\'t you--now, if it had\\nrained sugar-plums, or three-cornered raspberry tarts, or anything of\\nthat sort!\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Oh, cousin--\" Ada hastily began.\\n\\n\"Good, my pretty pet. I like cousin. Cousin John, perhaps, is\\nbetter.\"\\n\\n\"Then, cousin John--\" Ada laughingly began again.\\n\\n\"Ha, ha! Very good indeed!\" said Mr. Jarndyce with great enjoyment.\\n\"Sounds uncommonly natural. Yes, my dear?\"\\n\\n\"It did better than that. It rained Esther.\"\\n\\n\"Aye?\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"What did Esther do?\"\\n\\n\"Why, cousin John,\" said Ada, clasping her hands upon his arm and\\nshaking her head at me across him--for I wanted her to be\\nquiet--\"Esther was their friend directly. Esther nursed them, coaxed\\nthem to sleep, washed and dressed them, told them stories, kept them\\nquiet, bought them keepsakes\"--My dear girl! I had only gone out with\\nPeepy after he was found and given him a little, tiny horse!--\"and,\\ncousin John, she softened poor Caroline, the eldest one, so much and\\nwas so thoughtful for me and so amiable! No, no, I won\\'t be\\ncontradicted, Esther dear! You know, you know, it\\'s true!\"\\n\\nThe warm-hearted darling leaned across her cousin John and kissed me,\\nand then looking up in his face, boldly said, \"At all events, cousin\\nJohn, I WILL thank you for the companion you have given me.\" I felt\\nas if she challenged him to run away. But he didn\\'t.\\n\\n\"Where did you say the wind was, Rick?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"In the north as we came down, sir.\"\\n\\n\"You are right. There\\'s no east in it. A mistake of mine. Come,\\ngirls, come and see your home!\"\\n\\nIt was one of those delightfully irregular houses where you go up and\\ndown steps out of one room into another, and where you come upon more\\nrooms when you think you have seen all there are, and where there is\\na bountiful provision of little halls and passages, and where you\\nfind still older cottage-rooms in unexpected places with lattice\\nwindows and green growth pressing through them. Mine, which we\\nentered first, was of this kind, with an up-and-down roof that had\\nmore corners in it than I ever counted afterwards and a chimney\\n(there was a wood fire on the hearth) paved all around with pure\\nwhite tiles, in every one of which a bright miniature of the fire was\\nblazing. Out of this room, you went down two steps into a charming\\nlittle sitting-room looking down upon a flower-garden, which room was\\nhenceforth to belong to Ada and me. Out of this you went up three\\nsteps into Ada\\'s bedroom, which had a fine broad window commanding a\\nbeautiful view (we saw a great expanse of darkness lying underneath\\nthe stars), to which there was a hollow window-seat, in which, with a\\nspring-lock, three dear Adas might have been lost at once. Out of\\nthis room you passed into a little gallery, with which the other best\\nrooms (only two) communicated, and so, by a little staircase of\\nshallow steps with a number of corner stairs in it, considering its\\nlength, down into the hall. But if instead of going out at Ada\\'s door\\nyou came back into my room, and went out at the door by which you had\\nentered it, and turned up a few crooked steps that branched off in an\\nunexpected manner from the stairs, you lost yourself in passages,\\nwith mangles in them, and three-cornered tables, and a native Hindu\\nchair, which was also a sofa, a box, and a bedstead, and looked in\\nevery form something between a bamboo skeleton and a great bird-cage,\\nand had been brought from India nobody knew by whom or when. From\\nthese you came on Richard\\'s room, which was part library, part\\nsitting-room, part bedroom, and seemed indeed a comfortable compound\\nof many rooms. Out of that you went straight, with a little interval\\nof passage, to the plain room where Mr. Jarndyce slept, all the year\\nround, with his window open, his bedstead without any furniture\\nstanding in the middle of the floor for more air, and his cold bath\\ngaping for him in a smaller room adjoining. Out of that you came into\\nanother passage, where there were back-stairs and where you could\\nhear the horses being rubbed down outside the stable and being told\\nto \"Hold up\" and \"Get over,\" as they slipped about very much on the\\nuneven stones. Or you might, if you came out at another door (every\\nroom had at least two doors), go straight down to the hall again by\\nhalf-a-dozen steps and a low archway, wondering how you got back\\nthere or had ever got out of it.\\n\\nThe furniture, old-fashioned rather than old, like the house, was as\\npleasantly irregular. Ada\\'s sleeping-room was all flowers--in chintz\\nand paper, in velvet, in needlework, in the brocade of two stiff\\ncourtly chairs which stood, each attended by a little page of a stool\\nfor greater state, on either side of the fire-place. Our sitting-room\\nwas green and had framed and glazed upon the walls numbers of\\nsurprising and surprised birds, staring out of pictures at a real\\ntrout in a case, as brown and shining as if it had been served with\\ngravy; at the death of Captain Cook; and at the whole process of\\npreparing tea in China, as depicted by Chinese artists. In my room\\nthere were oval engravings of the months--ladies haymaking in short\\nwaists and large hats tied under the chin, for June; smooth-legged\\nnoblemen pointing with cocked-hats to village steeples, for October.\\nHalf-length portraits in crayons abounded all through the house, but\\nwere so dispersed that I found the brother of a youthful officer of\\nmine in the china-closet and the grey old age of my pretty young\\nbride, with a flower in her bodice, in the breakfast-room. As\\nsubstitutes, I had four angels, of Queen Anne\\'s reign, taking a\\ncomplacent gentleman to heaven, in festoons, with some difficulty;\\nand a composition in needlework representing fruit, a kettle, and an\\nalphabet. All the movables, from the wardrobes to the chairs and\\ntables, hangings, glasses, even to the pincushions and scent-bottles\\non the dressing-tables, displayed the same quaint variety. They\\nagreed in nothing but their perfect neatness, their display of the\\nwhitest linen, and their storing-up, wheresoever the existence of a\\ndrawer, small or large, rendered it possible, of quantities of\\nrose-leaves and sweet lavender. Such, with its illuminated windows,\\nsoftened here and there by shadows of curtains, shining out upon the\\nstarlight night; with its light, and warmth, and comfort; with its\\nhospitable jingle, at a distance, of preparations for dinner; with\\nthe face of its generous master brightening everything we saw; and\\njust wind enough without to sound a low accompaniment to everything\\nwe heard, were our first impressions of Bleak House.\\n\\n\"I am glad you like it,\" said Mr. Jarndyce when he had brought us\\nround again to Ada\\'s sitting-room. \"It makes no pretensions, but it\\nis a comfortable little place, I hope, and will be more so with such\\nbright young looks in it. You have barely half an hour before dinner.\\nThere\\'s no one here but the finest creature upon earth--a child.\"\\n\\n\"More children, Esther!\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mean literally a child,\" pursued Mr. Jarndyce; \"not a child\\nin years. He is grown up--he is at least as old as I am--but in\\nsimplicity, and freshness, and enthusiasm, and a fine guileless\\ninaptitude for all worldly affairs, he is a perfect child.\"\\n\\nWe felt that he must be very interesting.\\n\\n\"He knows Mrs. Jellyby,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"He is a musical man, an\\namateur, but might have been a professional. He is an artist too, an\\namateur, but might have been a professional. He is a man of\\nattainments and of captivating manners. He has been unfortunate in\\nhis affairs, and unfortunate in his pursuits, and unfortunate in his\\nfamily; but he don\\'t care--he\\'s a child!\"\\n\\n\"Did you imply that he has children of his own, sir?\" inquired\\nRichard.\\n\\n\"Yes, Rick! Half-a-dozen. More! Nearer a dozen, I should think. But\\nhe has never looked after them. How could he? He wanted somebody to\\nlook after HIM. He is a child, you know!\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"And have the children looked after themselves at all, sir?\" inquired\\nRichard.\\n\\n\"Why, just as you may suppose,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, his countenance\\nsuddenly falling. \"It is said that the children of the very poor are\\nnot brought up, but dragged up. Harold Skimpole\\'s children have\\ntumbled up somehow or other. The wind\\'s getting round again, I am\\nafraid. I feel it rather!\"\\n\\nRichard observed that the situation was exposed on a sharp night.\\n\\n\"It IS exposed,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"No doubt that\\'s the cause. Bleak\\nHouse has an exposed sound. But you are coming my way. Come along!\"\\n\\nOur luggage having arrived and being all at hand, I was dressed in a\\nfew minutes and engaged in putting my worldly goods away when a maid\\n(not the one in attendance upon Ada, but another, whom I had not\\nseen) brought a basket into my room with two bunches of keys in it,\\nall labelled.\\n\\n\"For you, miss, if you please,\" said she.\\n\\n\"For me?\" said I.\\n\\n\"The housekeeping keys, miss.\"\\n\\nI showed my surprise, for she added with some little surprise on her\\nown part, \"I was told to bring them as soon as you was alone, miss.\\nMiss Summerson, if I don\\'t deceive myself?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"That is my name.\"\\n\\n\"The large bunch is the housekeeping, and the little bunch is the\\ncellars, miss. Any time you was pleased to appoint to-morrow morning,\\nI was to show you the presses and things they belong to.\"\\n\\nI said I would be ready at half-past six, and after she was gone,\\nstood looking at the basket, quite lost in the magnitude of my trust.\\nAda found me thus and had such a delightful confidence in me when I\\nshowed her the keys and told her about them that it would have been\\ninsensibility and ingratitude not to feel encouraged. I knew, to be\\nsure, that it was the dear girl\\'s kindness, but I liked to be so\\npleasantly cheated.\\n\\nWhen we went downstairs, we were presented to Mr. Skimpole, who was\\nstanding before the fire telling Richard how fond he used to be, in\\nhis school-time, of football. He was a little bright creature with a\\nrather large head, but a delicate face and a sweet voice, and there\\nwas a perfect charm in him. All he said was so free from effort and\\nspontaneous and was said with such a captivating gaiety that it was\\nfascinating to hear him talk. Being of a more slender figure than Mr.\\nJarndyce and having a richer complexion, with browner hair, he looked\\nyounger. Indeed, he had more the appearance in all respects of a\\ndamaged young man than a well-preserved elderly one. There was an\\neasy negligence in his manner and even in his dress (his hair\\ncarelessly disposed, and his neck-kerchief loose and flowing, as I\\nhave seen artists paint their own portraits) which I could not\\nseparate from the idea of a romantic youth who had undergone some\\nunique process of depreciation. It struck me as being not at all like\\nthe manner or appearance of a man who had advanced in life by the\\nusual road of years, cares, and experiences.\\n\\nI gathered from the conversation that Mr. Skimpole had been educated\\nfor the medical profession and had once lived, in his professional\\ncapacity, in the household of a German prince. He told us, however,\\nthat as he had always been a mere child in point of weights and\\nmeasures and had never known anything about them (except that they\\ndisgusted him), he had never been able to prescribe with the\\nrequisite accuracy of detail. In fact, he said, he had no head for\\ndetail. And he told us, with great humour, that when he was wanted to\\nbleed the prince or physic any of his people, he was generally found\\nlying on his back in bed, reading the newspapers or making\\nfancy-sketches in pencil, and couldn\\'t come. The prince, at last,\\nobjecting to this, \"in which,\" said Mr. Skimpole, in the frankest\\nmanner, \"he was perfectly right,\" the engagement terminated, and Mr.\\nSkimpole having (as he added with delightful gaiety) \"nothing to live\\nupon but love, fell in love, and married, and surrounded himself with\\nrosy cheeks.\" His good friend Jarndyce and some other of his good\\nfriends then helped him, in quicker or slower succession, to several\\nopenings in life, but to no purpose, for he must confess to two of\\nthe oldest infirmities in the world: one was that he had no idea of\\ntime, the other that he had no idea of money. In consequence of which\\nhe never kept an appointment, never could transact any business, and\\nnever knew the value of anything! Well! So he had got on in life, and\\nhere he was! He was very fond of reading the papers, very fond of\\nmaking fancy-sketches with a pencil, very fond of nature, very fond\\nof art. All he asked of society was to let him live. THAT wasn\\'t\\nmuch. His wants were few. Give him the papers, conversation, music,\\nmutton, coffee, landscape, fruit in the season, a few sheets of\\nBristol-board, and a little claret, and he asked no more. He was a\\nmere child in the world, but he didn\\'t cry for the moon. He said to\\nthe world, \"Go your several ways in peace! Wear red coats, blue\\ncoats, lawn sleeves; put pens behind your ears, wear aprons; go after\\nglory, holiness, commerce, trade, any object you prefer; only--let\\nHarold Skimpole live!\"\\n\\nAll this and a great deal more he told us, not only with the\\nutmost brilliancy and enjoyment, but with a certain vivacious\\ncandour--speaking of himself as if he were not at all his own affair,\\nas if Skimpole were a third person, as if he knew that Skimpole had\\nhis singularities but still had his claims too, which were the\\ngeneral business of the community and must not be slighted. He was\\nquite enchanting. If I felt at all confused at that early time in\\nendeavouring to reconcile anything he said with anything I had\\nthought about the duties and accountabilities of life (which I am far\\nfrom sure of), I was confused by not exactly understanding why he was\\nfree of them. That he WAS free of them, I scarcely doubted; he was so\\nvery clear about it himself.\\n\\n\"I covet nothing,\" said Mr. Skimpole in the same light way.\\n\"Possession is nothing to me. Here is my friend Jarndyce\\'s excellent\\nhouse. I feel obliged to him for possessing it. I can sketch it and\\nalter it. I can set it to music. When I am here, I have sufficient\\npossession of it and have neither trouble, cost, nor responsibility.\\nMy steward\\'s name, in short, is Jarndyce, and he can\\'t cheat me. We\\nhave been mentioning Mrs. Jellyby. There is a bright-eyed woman, of a\\nstrong will and immense power of business detail, who throws herself\\ninto objects with surprising ardour! I don\\'t regret that I have not a\\nstrong will and an immense power of business detail to throw myself\\ninto objects with surprising ardour. I can admire her without envy. I\\ncan sympathize with the objects. I can dream of them. I can lie down\\non the grass--in fine weather--and float along an African river,\\nembracing all the natives I meet, as sensible of the deep silence and\\nsketching the dense overhanging tropical growth as accurately as if I\\nwere there. I don\\'t know that it\\'s of any direct use my doing so, but\\nit\\'s all I can do, and I do it thoroughly. Then, for heaven\\'s sake,\\nhaving Harold Skimpole, a confiding child, petitioning you, the\\nworld, an agglomeration of practical people of business habits, to\\nlet him live and admire the human family, do it somehow or other,\\nlike good souls, and suffer him to ride his rocking-horse!\"\\n\\nIt was plain enough that Mr. Jarndyce had not been neglectful of the\\nadjuration. Mr. Skimpole\\'s general position there would have rendered\\nit so without the addition of what he presently said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s only you, the generous creatures, whom I envy,\" said Mr.\\nSkimpole, addressing us, his new friends, in an impersonal manner. \"I\\nenvy you your power of doing what you do. It is what I should revel\\nin myself. I don\\'t feel any vulgar gratitude to you. I almost feel as\\nif YOU ought to be grateful to ME for giving you the opportunity of\\nenjoying the luxury of generosity. I know you like it. For anything I\\ncan tell, I may have come into the world expressly for the purpose of\\nincreasing your stock of happiness. I may have been born to be a\\nbenefactor to you by sometimes giving you an opportunity of assisting\\nme in my little perplexities. Why should I regret my incapacity for\\ndetails and worldly affairs when it leads to such pleasant\\nconsequences? I don\\'t regret it therefore.\"\\n\\nOf all his playful speeches (playful, yet always fully meaning what\\nthey expressed) none seemed to be more to the taste of Mr. Jarndyce\\nthan this. I had often new temptations, afterwards, to wonder whether\\nit was really singular, or only singular to me, that he, who was\\nprobably the most grateful of mankind upon the least occasion, should\\nso desire to escape the gratitude of others.\\n\\nWe were all enchanted. I felt it a merited tribute to the engaging\\nqualities of Ada and Richard that Mr. Skimpole, seeing them for the\\nfirst time, should be so unreserved and should lay himself out to be\\nso exquisitely agreeable. They (and especially Richard) were\\nnaturally pleased, for similar reasons, and considered it no common\\nprivilege to be so freely confided in by such an attractive man. The\\nmore we listened, the more gaily Mr. Skimpole talked. And what with\\nhis fine hilarious manner and his engaging candour and his genial way\\nof lightly tossing his own weaknesses about, as if he had said, \"I am\\na child, you know! You are designing people compared with me\" (he\\nreally made me consider myself in that light) \"but I am gay and\\ninnocent; forget your worldly arts and play with me!\" the effect was\\nabsolutely dazzling.\\n\\nHe was so full of feeling too and had such a delicate sentiment for\\nwhat was beautiful or tender that he could have won a heart by that\\nalone. In the evening, when I was preparing to make tea and Ada was\\ntouching the piano in the adjoining room and softly humming a tune to\\nher cousin Richard, which they had happened to mention, he came and\\nsat down on the sofa near me and so spoke of Ada that I almost loved\\nhim.\\n\\n\"She is like the morning,\" he said. \"With that golden hair, those\\nblue eyes, and that fresh bloom on her cheek, she is like the summer\\nmorning. The birds here will mistake her for it. We will not call\\nsuch a lovely young creature as that, who is a joy to all mankind, an\\norphan. She is the child of the universe.\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce, I found, was standing near us with his hands behind him\\nand an attentive smile upon his face.\\n\\n\"The universe,\" he observed, \"makes rather an indifferent parent, I\\nam afraid.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I don\\'t know!\" cried Mr. Skimpole buoyantly.\\n\\n\"I think I do know,\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Well!\" cried Mr. Skimpole. \"You know the world (which in your sense\\nis the universe), and I know nothing of it, so you shall have your\\nway. But if I had mine,\" glancing at the cousins, \"there should be no\\nbrambles of sordid realities in such a path as that. It should be\\nstrewn with roses; it should lie through bowers, where there was no\\nspring, autumn, nor winter, but perpetual summer. Age or change\\nshould never wither it. The base word money should never be breathed\\nnear it!\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce patted him on the head with a smile, as if he had been\\nreally a child, and passing a step or two on, and stopping a moment,\\nglanced at the young cousins. His look was thoughtful, but had a\\nbenignant expression in it which I often (how often!) saw again,\\nwhich has long been engraven on my heart. The room in which they\\nwere, communicating with that in which he stood, was only lighted by\\nthe fire. Ada sat at the piano; Richard stood beside her, bending\\ndown. Upon the wall, their shadows blended together, surrounded by\\nstrange forms, not without a ghostly motion caught from the unsteady\\nfire, though reflecting from motionless objects. Ada touched the\\nnotes so softly and sang so low that the wind, sighing away to the\\ndistant hills, was as audible as the music. The mystery of the future\\nand the little clue afforded to it by the voice of the present seemed\\nexpressed in the whole picture.\\n\\nBut it is not to recall this fancy, well as I remember it, that I\\nrecall the scene. First, I was not quite unconscious of the contrast\\nin respect of meaning and intention between the silent look directed\\nthat way and the flow of words that had preceded it. Secondly, though\\nMr. Jarndyce\\'s glance as he withdrew it rested for but a moment on\\nme, I felt as if in that moment he confided to me--and knew that he\\nconfided to me and that I received the confidence--his hope that Ada\\nand Richard might one day enter on a dearer relationship.\\n\\nMr. Skimpole could play on the piano and the violoncello, and he was\\na composer--had composed half an opera once, but got tired of it--and\\nplayed what he composed with taste. After tea we had quite a little\\nconcert, in which Richard--who was enthralled by Ada\\'s singing and\\ntold me that she seemed to know all the songs that ever were\\nwritten--and Mr. Jarndyce, and I were the audience. After a little\\nwhile I missed first Mr. Skimpole and afterwards Richard, and while I\\nwas thinking how could Richard stay away so long and lose so much,\\nthe maid who had given me the keys looked in at the door, saying, \"If\\nyou please, miss, could you spare a minute?\"\\n\\nWhen I was shut out with her in the hall, she said, holding up her\\nhands, \"Oh, if you please, miss, Mr. Carstone says would you come\\nupstairs to Mr. Skimpole\\'s room. He has been took, miss!\"\\n\\n\"Took?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Took, miss. Sudden,\" said the maid.\\n\\nI was apprehensive that his illness might be of a dangerous kind, but\\nof course I begged her to be quiet and not disturb any one and\\ncollected myself, as I followed her quickly upstairs, sufficiently to\\nconsider what were the best remedies to be applied if it should prove\\nto be a fit. She threw open a door and I went into a chamber, where,\\nto my unspeakable surprise, instead of finding Mr. Skimpole stretched\\nupon the bed or prostrate on the floor, I found him standing before\\nthe fire smiling at Richard, while Richard, with a face of great\\nembarrassment, looked at a person on the sofa, in a white great-coat,\\nwith smooth hair upon his head and not much of it, which he was\\nwiping smoother and making less of with a pocket-handkerchief.\\n\\n\"Miss Summerson,\" said Richard hurriedly, \"I am glad you are come.\\nYou will be able to advise us. Our friend Mr. Skimpole--don\\'t be\\nalarmed!--is arrested for debt.\"\\n\\n\"And really, my dear Miss Summerson,\" said Mr. Skimpole with his\\nagreeable candour, \"I never was in a situation in which that\\nexcellent sense and quiet habit of method and usefulness, which\\nanybody must observe in you who has the happiness of being a quarter\\nof an hour in your society, was more needed.\"\\n\\nThe person on the sofa, who appeared to have a cold in his head, gave\\nsuch a very loud snort that he startled me.\\n\\n\"Are you arrested for much, sir?\" I inquired of Mr. Skimpole.\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Summerson,\" said he, shaking his head pleasantly, \"I\\ndon\\'t know. Some pounds, odd shillings, and halfpence, I think, were\\nmentioned.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s twenty-four pound, sixteen, and sevenpence ha\\'penny,\" observed\\nthe stranger. \"That\\'s wot it is.\"\\n\\n\"And it sounds--somehow it sounds,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"like a small\\nsum?\"\\n\\nThe strange man said nothing but made another snort. It was such a\\npowerful one that it seemed quite to lift him out of his seat.\\n\\n\"Mr. Skimpole,\" said Richard to me, \"has a delicacy in applying to my\\ncousin Jarndyce because he has lately--I think, sir, I understood you\\nthat you had lately--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" returned Mr. Skimpole, smiling. \"Though I forgot how much\\nit was and when it was. Jarndyce would readily do it again, but I\\nhave the epicure-like feeling that I would prefer a novelty in help,\\nthat I would rather,\" and he looked at Richard and me, \"develop\\ngenerosity in a new soil and in a new form of flower.\"\\n\\n\"What do you think will be best, Miss Summerson?\" said Richard,\\naside.\\n\\nI ventured to inquire, generally, before replying, what would happen\\nif the money were not produced.\\n\\n\"Jail,\" said the strange man, coolly putting his handkerchief into\\nhis hat, which was on the floor at his feet. \"Or Coavinses.\"\\n\\n\"May I ask, sir, what is--\"\\n\\n\"Coavinses?\" said the strange man. \"A \\'ouse.\"\\n\\nRichard and I looked at one another again. It was a most singular\\nthing that the arrest was our embarrassment and not Mr. Skimpole\\'s.\\nHe observed us with a genial interest, but there seemed, if I may\\nventure on such a contradiction, nothing selfish in it. He had\\nentirely washed his hands of the difficulty, and it had become ours.\\n\\n\"I thought,\" he suggested, as if good-naturedly to help us out, \"that\\nbeing parties in a Chancery suit concerning (as people say) a large\\namount of property, Mr. Richard or his beautiful cousin, or both,\\ncould sign something, or make over something, or give some sort of\\nundertaking, or pledge, or bond? I don\\'t know what the business name\\nof it may be, but I suppose there is some instrument within their\\npower that would settle this?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit on it,\" said the strange man.\\n\\n\"Really?\" returned Mr. Skimpole. \"That seems odd, now, to one who is\\nno judge of these things!\"\\n\\n\"Odd or even,\" said the stranger gruffly, \"I tell you, not a bit on\\nit!\"\\n\\n\"Keep your temper, my good fellow, keep your temper!\" Mr. Skimpole\\ngently reasoned with him as he made a little drawing of his head on\\nthe fly-leaf of a book. \"Don\\'t be ruffled by your occupation. We can\\nseparate you from your office; we can separate the individual from\\nthe pursuit. We are not so prejudiced as to suppose that in private\\nlife you are otherwise than a very estimable man, with a great deal\\nof poetry in your nature, of which you may not be conscious.\"\\n\\nThe stranger only answered with another violent snort, whether in\\nacceptance of the poetry-tribute or in disdainful rejection of it, he\\ndid not express to me.\\n\\n\"Now, my dear Miss Summerson, and my dear Mr. Richard,\" said Mr.\\nSkimpole gaily, innocently, and confidingly as he looked at his\\ndrawing with his head on one side, \"here you see me utterly incapable\\nof helping myself, and entirely in your hands! I only ask to be free.\\nThe butterflies are free. Mankind will surely not deny to Harold\\nSkimpole what it concedes to the butterflies!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Summerson,\" said Richard in a whisper, \"I have ten\\npounds that I received from Mr. Kenge. I must try what that will do.\"\\n\\nI possessed fifteen pounds, odd shillings, which I had saved from my\\nquarterly allowance during several years. I had always thought that\\nsome accident might happen which would throw me suddenly, without any\\nrelation or any property, on the world and had always tried to keep\\nsome little money by me that I might not be quite penniless. I told\\nRichard of my having this little store and having no present need of\\nit, and I asked him delicately to inform Mr. Skimpole, while I should\\nbe gone to fetch it, that we would have the pleasure of paying his\\ndebt.\\n\\nWhen I came back, Mr. Skimpole kissed my hand and seemed quite\\ntouched. Not on his own account (I was again aware of that perplexing\\nand extraordinary contradiction), but on ours, as if personal\\nconsiderations were impossible with him and the contemplation of our\\nhappiness alone affected him. Richard, begging me, for the greater\\ngrace of the transaction, as he said, to settle with Coavinses (as\\nMr. Skimpole now jocularly called him), I counted out the money and\\nreceived the necessary acknowledgment. This, too, delighted Mr.\\nSkimpole.\\n\\nHis compliments were so delicately administered that I blushed less\\nthan I might have done and settled with the stranger in the white\\ncoat without making any mistakes. He put the money in his pocket and\\nshortly said, \"Well, then, I\\'ll wish you a good evening, miss.\\n\\n\"My friend,\" said Mr. Skimpole, standing with his back to the fire\\nafter giving up the sketch when it was half finished, \"I should like\\nto ask you something, without offence.\"\\n\\nI think the reply was, \"Cut away, then!\"\\n\\n\"Did you know this morning, now, that you were coming out on this\\nerrand?\" said Mr. Skimpole.\\n\\n\"Know\\'d it yes\\'day aft\\'noon at tea-time,\" said Coavinses.\\n\\n\"It didn\\'t affect your appetite? Didn\\'t make you at all uneasy?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit,\" said Coavinses. \"I know\\'d if you wos missed to-day, you\\nwouldn\\'t be missed to-morrow. A day makes no such odds.\"\\n\\n\"But when you came down here,\" proceeded Mr. Skimpole, \"it was a fine\\nday. The sun was shining, the wind was blowing, the lights and\\nshadows were passing across the fields, the birds were singing.\"\\n\\n\"Nobody said they warn\\'t, in MY hearing,\" returned Coavinses.\\n\\n\"No,\" observed Mr. Skimpole. \"But what did you think upon the road?\"\\n\\n\"Wot do you mean?\" growled Coavinses with an appearance of strong\\nresentment. \"Think! I\\'ve got enough to do, and little enough to get\\nfor it without thinking. Thinking!\" (with profound contempt).\\n\\n\"Then you didn\\'t think, at all events,\" proceeded Mr. Skimpole, \"to\\nthis effect: \\'Harold Skimpole loves to see the sun shine, loves to\\nhear the wind blow, loves to watch the changing lights and shadows,\\nloves to hear the birds, those choristers in Nature\\'s great\\ncathedral. And does it seem to me that I am about to deprive Harold\\nSkimpole of his share in such possessions, which are his only\\nbirthright!\\' You thought nothing to that effect?\"\\n\\n\"I--certainly--did--NOT,\" said Coavinses, whose doggedness in utterly\\nrenouncing the idea was of that intense kind that he could only give\\nadequate expression to it by putting a long interval between each\\nword, and accompanying the last with a jerk that might have\\ndislocated his neck.\\n\\n\"Very odd and very curious, the mental process is, in you men of\\nbusiness!\" said Mr. Skimpole thoughtfully. \"Thank you, my friend.\\nGood night.\"\\n\\nAs our absence had been long enough already to seem strange\\ndownstairs, I returned at once and found Ada sitting at work by the\\nfireside talking to her cousin John. Mr. Skimpole presently appeared,\\nand Richard shortly after him. I was sufficiently engaged during the\\nremainder of the evening in taking my first lesson in backgammon from\\nMr. Jarndyce, who was very fond of the game and from whom I wished of\\ncourse to learn it as quickly as I could in order that I might be of\\nthe very small use of being able to play when he had no better\\nadversary. But I thought, occasionally, when Mr. Skimpole played some\\nfragments of his own compositions or when, both at the piano and the\\nvioloncello, and at our table, he preserved with an absence of all\\neffort his delightful spirits and his easy flow of conversation, that\\nRichard and I seemed to retain the transferred impression of having\\nbeen arrested since dinner and that it was very curious altogether.\\n\\nIt was late before we separated, for when Ada was going at eleven\\no\\'clock, Mr. Skimpole went to the piano and rattled hilariously that\\nthe best of all ways to lengthen our days was to steal a few hours\\nfrom night, my dear! It was past twelve before he took his candle and\\nhis radiant face out of the room, and I think he might have kept us\\nthere, if he had seen fit, until daybreak. Ada and Richard were\\nlingering for a few moments by the fire, wondering whether Mrs.\\nJellyby had yet finished her dictation for the day, when Mr.\\nJarndyce, who had been out of the room, returned.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear me, what\\'s this, what\\'s this!\" he said, rubbing his head\\nand walking about with his good-humoured vexation. \"What\\'s this they\\ntell me? Rick, my boy, Esther, my dear, what have you been doing? Why\\ndid you do it? How could you do it? How much apiece was it? The\\nwind\\'s round again. I feel it all over me!\"\\n\\nWe neither of us quite knew what to answer.\\n\\n\"Come, Rick, come! I must settle this before I sleep. How much are\\nyou out of pocket? You two made the money up, you know! Why did you?\\nHow could you? Oh, Lord, yes, it\\'s due east--must be!\"\\n\\n\"Really, sir,\" said Richard, \"I don\\'t think it would be honourable in\\nme to tell you. Mr. Skimpole relied upon us--\"\\n\\n\"Lord bless you, my dear boy! He relies upon everybody!\" said Mr.\\nJarndyce, giving his head a great rub and stopping short.\\n\\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Everybody! And he\\'ll be in the same scrape again next week!\" said\\nMr. Jarndyce, walking again at a great pace, with a candle in his\\nhand that had gone out. \"He\\'s always in the same scrape. He was born\\nin the same scrape. I verily believe that the announcement in the\\nnewspapers when his mother was confined was \\'On Tuesday last, at her\\nresidence in Botheration Buildings, Mrs. Skimpole of a son in\\ndifficulties.\\'\"\\n\\nRichard laughed heartily but added, \"Still, sir, I don\\'t want to\\nshake his confidence or to break his confidence, and if I submit to\\nyour better knowledge again, that I ought to keep his secret, I hope\\nyou will consider before you press me any more. Of course, if you do\\npress me, sir, I shall know I am wrong and will tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce, stopping again, and making several absent\\nendeavours to put his candlestick in his pocket. \"I--here! Take it\\naway, my dear. I don\\'t know what I am about with it; it\\'s all the\\nwind--invariably has that effect--I won\\'t press you, Rick; you may be\\nright. But really--to get hold of you and Esther--and to squeeze you\\nlike a couple of tender young Saint Michael\\'s oranges! It\\'ll blow a\\ngale in the course of the night!\"\\n\\nHe was now alternately putting his hands into his pockets as if he\\nwere going to keep them there a long time, and taking them out again\\nand vehemently rubbing them all over his head.\\n\\nI ventured to take this opportunity of hinting that Mr. Skimpole,\\nbeing in all such matters quite a child--\\n\\n\"Eh, my dear?\" said Mr. Jarndyce, catching at the word.\\n\\n\"Being quite a child, sir,\" said I, \"and so different from other\\npeople--\"\\n\\n\"You are right!\" said Mr. Jarndyce, brightening. \"Your woman\\'s wit\\nhits the mark. He is a child--an absolute child. I told you he was a\\nchild, you know, when I first mentioned him.\"\\n\\nCertainly! Certainly! we said.\\n\\n\"And he IS a child. Now, isn\\'t he?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce, brightening\\nmore and more.\\n\\nHe was indeed, we said.\\n\\n\"When you come to think of it, it\\'s the height of childishness in\\nyou--I mean me--\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to regard him for a moment as a\\nman. You can\\'t make HIM responsible. The idea of Harold Skimpole with\\ndesigns or plans, or knowledge of consequences! Ha, ha, ha!\"\\n\\nIt was so delicious to see the clouds about his bright face clearing,\\nand to see him so heartily pleased, and to know, as it was impossible\\nnot to know, that the source of his pleasure was the goodness which\\nwas tortured by condemning, or mistrusting, or secretly accusing any\\none, that I saw the tears in Ada\\'s eyes, while she echoed his laugh,\\nand felt them in my own.\\n\\n\"Why, what a cod\\'s head and shoulders I am,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to\\nrequire reminding of it! The whole business shows the child from\\nbeginning to end. Nobody but a child would have thought of singling\\nYOU two out for parties in the affair! Nobody but a child would have\\nthought of YOUR having the money! If it had been a thousand pounds,\\nit would have been just the same!\" said Mr. Jarndyce with his whole\\nface in a glow.\\n\\nWe all confirmed it from our night\\'s experience.\\n\\n\"To be sure, to be sure!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"However, Rick, Esther,\\nand you too, Ada, for I don\\'t know that even your little purse is\\nsafe from his inexperience--I must have a promise all round that\\nnothing of this sort shall ever be done any more. No advances! Not\\neven sixpences.\"\\n\\nWe all promised faithfully, Richard with a merry glance at me\\ntouching his pocket as if to remind me that there was no danger of\\nOUR transgressing.\\n\\n\"As to Skimpole,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"a habitable doll\\'s house with\\ngood board and a few tin people to get into debt with and borrow\\nmoney of would set the boy up in life. He is in a child\\'s sleep by\\nthis time, I suppose; it\\'s time I should take my craftier head to my\\nmore worldly pillow. Good night, my dears. God bless you!\"\\n\\nHe peeped in again, with a smiling face, before we had lighted our\\ncandles, and said, \"Oh! I have been looking at the weather-cock. I\\nfind it was a false alarm about the wind. It\\'s in the south!\" And\\nwent away singing to himself.\\n\\nAda and I agreed, as we talked together for a little while upstairs,\\nthat this caprice about the wind was a fiction and that he used the\\npretence to account for any disappointment he could not conceal,\\nrather than he would blame the real cause of it or disparage or\\ndepreciate any one. We thought this very characteristic of his\\neccentric gentleness and of the difference between him and those\\npetulant people who make the weather and the winds (particularly that\\nunlucky wind which he had chosen for such a different purpose) the\\nstalking-horses of their splenetic and gloomy humours.\\n\\nIndeed, so much affection for him had been added in this one evening\\nto my gratitude that I hoped I already began to understand him\\nthrough that mingled feeling. Any seeming inconsistencies in Mr.\\nSkimpole or in Mrs. Jellyby I could not expect to be able to\\nreconcile, having so little experience or practical knowledge.\\nNeither did I try, for my thoughts were busy when I was alone, with\\nAda and Richard and with the confidence I had seemed to receive\\nconcerning them. My fancy, made a little wild by the wind perhaps,\\nwould not consent to be all unselfish, either, though I would have\\npersuaded it to be so if I could. It wandered back to my godmother\\'s\\nhouse and came along the intervening track, raising up shadowy\\nspeculations which had sometimes trembled there in the dark as to\\nwhat knowledge Mr. Jarndyce had of my earliest history--even as to\\nthe possibility of his being my father, though that idle dream was\\nquite gone now.\\n\\nIt was all gone now, I remembered, getting up from the fire. It was\\nnot for me to muse over bygones, but to act with a cheerful spirit\\nand a grateful heart. So I said to myself, \"Esther, Esther, Esther!\\nDuty, my dear!\" and gave my little basket of housekeeping keys such a\\nshake that they sounded like little bells and rang me hopefully to\\nbed.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile Esther sleeps, and while Esther wakes, it is still wet weather\\ndown at the place in Lincolnshire. The rain is ever falling--drip,\\ndrip, drip--by day and night upon the broad flagged terrace-pavement,\\nthe Ghost\\'s Walk. The weather is so very bad down in Lincolnshire\\nthat the liveliest imagination can scarcely apprehend its ever being\\nfine again. Not that there is any superabundant life of imagination\\non the spot, for Sir Leicester is not here (and, truly, even if he\\nwere, would not do much for it in that particular), but is in Paris\\nwith my Lady; and solitude, with dusky wings, sits brooding upon\\nChesney Wold.\\n\\nThere may be some motions of fancy among the lower animals at Chesney\\nWold. The horses in the stables--the long stables in a barren,\\nred-brick court-yard, where there is a great bell in a turret, and a\\nclock with a large face, which the pigeons who live near it and who\\nlove to perch upon its shoulders seem to be always consulting--THEY\\nmay contemplate some mental pictures of fine weather on occasions,\\nand may be better artists at them than the grooms. The old roan, so\\nfamous for cross-country work, turning his large eyeball to the\\ngrated window near his rack, may remember the fresh leaves that\\nglisten there at other times and the scents that stream in, and may\\nhave a fine run with the hounds, while the human helper, clearing out\\nthe next stall, never stirs beyond his pitchfork and birch-broom. The\\ngrey, whose place is opposite the door and who with an impatient\\nrattle of his halter pricks his ears and turns his head so wistfully\\nwhen it is opened, and to whom the opener says, \"Woa grey, then,\\nsteady! Noabody wants you to-day!\" may know it quite as well as the\\nman. The whole seemingly monotonous and uncompanionable half-dozen,\\nstabled together, may pass the long wet hours when the door is shut\\nin livelier communication than is held in the servants\\' hall or at\\nthe Dedlock Arms, or may even beguile the time by improving (perhaps\\ncorrupting) the pony in the loose-box in the corner.\\n\\nSo the mastiff, dozing in his kennel in the court-yard with his large\\nhead on his paws, may think of the hot sunshine when the shadows of\\nthe stable-buildings tire his patience out by changing and leave him\\nat one time of the day no broader refuge than the shadow of his own\\nhouse, where he sits on end, panting and growling short, and very\\nmuch wanting something to worry besides himself and his chain. So\\nnow, half-waking and all-winking, he may recall the house full of\\ncompany, the coach-houses full of vehicles, the stables full of\\nhorses, and the out-buildings full of attendants upon horses, until\\nhe is undecided about the present and comes forth to see how it is.\\nThen, with that impatient shake of himself, he may growl in the\\nspirit, \"Rain, rain, rain! Nothing but rain--and no family here!\" as\\nhe goes in again and lies down with a gloomy yawn.\\n\\nSo with the dogs in the kennel-buildings across the park, who have\\ntheir restless fits and whose doleful voices when the wind has been\\nvery obstinate have even made it known in the house itself--upstairs,\\ndownstairs, and in my Lady\\'s chamber. They may hunt the whole\\ncountry-side, while the raindrops are pattering round their\\ninactivity. So the rabbits with their self-betraying tails, frisking\\nin and out of holes at roots of trees, may be lively with ideas of\\nthe breezy days when their ears are blown about or of those seasons\\nof interest when there are sweet young plants to gnaw. The turkey in\\nthe poultry-yard, always troubled with a class-grievance (probably\\nChristmas), may be reminiscent of that summer morning wrongfully\\ntaken from him when he got into the lane among the felled trees,\\nwhere there was a barn and barley. The discontented goose, who stoops\\nto pass under the old gateway, twenty feet high, may gabble out, if\\nwe only knew it, a waddling preference for weather when the gateway\\ncasts its shadow on the ground.\\n\\nBe this as it may, there is not much fancy otherwise stirring at\\nChesney Wold. If there be a little at any odd moment, it goes, like a\\nlittle noise in that old echoing place, a long way and usually leads\\noff to ghosts and mystery.\\n\\nIt has rained so hard and rained so long down in Lincolnshire that\\nMrs. Rouncewell, the old housekeeper at Chesney Wold, has several\\ntimes taken off her spectacles and cleaned them to make certain that\\nthe drops were not upon the glasses. Mrs. Rouncewell might have been\\nsufficiently assured by hearing the rain, but that she is rather\\ndeaf, which nothing will induce her to believe. She is a fine old\\nlady, handsome, stately, wonderfully neat, and has such a back and\\nsuch a stomacher that if her stays should turn out when she dies to\\nhave been a broad old-fashioned family fire-grate, nobody who knows\\nher would have cause to be surprised. Weather affects Mrs. Rouncewell\\nlittle. The house is there in all weathers, and the house, as she\\nexpresses it, \"is what she looks at.\" She sits in her room (in a side\\npassage on the ground floor, with an arched window commanding a\\nsmooth quadrangle, adorned at regular intervals with smooth round\\ntrees and smooth round blocks of stone, as if the trees were going to\\nplay at bowls with the stones), and the whole house reposes on her\\nmind. She can open it on occasion and be busy and fluttered, but it\\nis shut up now and lies on the breadth of Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s\\niron-bound bosom in a majestic sleep.\\n\\nIt is the next difficult thing to an impossibility to imagine Chesney\\nWold without Mrs. Rouncewell, but she has only been here fifty years.\\nAsk her how long, this rainy day, and she shall answer \"fifty year,\\nthree months, and a fortnight, by the blessing of heaven, if I live\\ntill Tuesday.\" Mr. Rouncewell died some time before the decease of\\nthe pretty fashion of pig-tails, and modestly hid his own (if he took\\nit with him) in a corner of the churchyard in the park near the\\nmouldy porch. He was born in the market-town, and so was his young\\nwidow. Her progress in the family began in the time of the last Sir\\nLeicester and originated in the still-room.\\n\\nThe present representative of the Dedlocks is an excellent master. He\\nsupposes all his dependents to be utterly bereft of individual\\ncharacters, intentions, or opinions, and is persuaded that he was\\nborn to supersede the necessity of their having any. If he were to\\nmake a discovery to the contrary, he would be simply stunned--would\\nnever recover himself, most likely, except to gasp and die. But he is\\nan excellent master still, holding it a part of his state to be so.\\nHe has a great liking for Mrs. Rouncewell; he says she is a most\\nrespectable, creditable woman. He always shakes hands with her when\\nhe comes down to Chesney Wold and when he goes away; and if he were\\nvery ill, or if he were knocked down by accident, or run over, or\\nplaced in any situation expressive of a Dedlock at a disadvantage, he\\nwould say if he could speak, \"Leave me, and send Mrs. Rouncewell\\nhere!\" feeling his dignity, at such a pass, safer with her than with\\nanybody else.\\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell has known trouble. She has had two sons, of whom the\\nyounger ran wild, and went for a soldier, and never came back. Even\\nto this hour, Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s calm hands lose their composure when\\nshe speaks of him, and unfolding themselves from her stomacher, hover\\nabout her in an agitated manner as she says what a likely lad, what a\\nfine lad, what a gay, good-humoured, clever lad he was! Her second\\nson would have been provided for at Chesney Wold and would have been\\nmade steward in due season, but he took, when he was a schoolboy, to\\nconstructing steam-engines out of saucepans and setting birds to draw\\ntheir own water with the least possible amount of labour, so\\nassisting them with artful contrivance of hydraulic pressure that a\\nthirsty canary had only, in a literal sense, to put his shoulder to\\nthe wheel and the job was done. This propensity gave Mrs. Rouncewell\\ngreat uneasiness. She felt it with a mother\\'s anguish to be a move in\\nthe Wat Tyler direction, well knowing that Sir Leicester had that\\ngeneral impression of an aptitude for any art to which smoke and a\\ntall chimney might be considered essential. But the doomed young\\nrebel (otherwise a mild youth, and very persevering), showing no sign\\nof grace as he got older but, on the contrary, constructing a model\\nof a power-loom, she was fain, with many tears, to mention his\\nbackslidings to the baronet. \"Mrs. Rouncewell,\" said Sir Leicester,\\n\"I can never consent to argue, as you know, with any one on any\\nsubject. You had better get rid of your boy; you had better get him\\ninto some Works. The iron country farther north is, I suppose, the\\ncongenial direction for a boy with these tendencies.\" Farther north\\nhe went, and farther north he grew up; and if Sir Leicester Dedlock\\never saw him when he came to Chesney Wold to visit his mother, or\\never thought of him afterwards, it is certain that he only regarded\\nhim as one of a body of some odd thousand conspirators, swarthy and\\ngrim, who were in the habit of turning out by torchlight two or three\\nnights in the week for unlawful purposes.\\n\\nNevertheless, Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s son has, in the course of nature and\\nart, grown up, and established himself, and married, and called unto\\nhim Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s grandson, who, being out of his apprenticeship,\\nand home from a journey in far countries, whither he was sent to\\nenlarge his knowledge and complete his preparations for the venture\\nof this life, stands leaning against the chimney-piece this very day\\nin Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s room at Chesney Wold.\\n\\n\"And, again and again, I am glad to see you, Watt! And, once again, I\\nam glad to see you, Watt!\" says Mrs. Rouncewell. \"You are a fine\\nyoung fellow. You are like your poor uncle George. Ah!\" Mrs.\\nRouncewell\\'s hands unquiet, as usual, on this reference.\\n\\n\"They say I am like my father, grandmother.\"\\n\\n\"Like him, also, my dear--but most like your poor uncle George! And\\nyour dear father.\" Mrs. Rouncewell folds her hands again. \"He is\\nwell?\"\\n\\n\"Thriving, grandmother, in every way.\"\\n\\n\"I am thankful!\" Mrs. Rouncewell is fond of her son but has a\\nplaintive feeling towards him, much as if he were a very honourable\\nsoldier who had gone over to the enemy.\\n\\n\"He is quite happy?\" says she.\\n\\n\"Quite.\"\\n\\n\"I am thankful! So he has brought you up to follow in his ways and\\nhas sent you into foreign countries and the like? Well, he knows\\nbest. There may be a world beyond Chesney Wold that I don\\'t\\nunderstand. Though I am not young, either. And I have seen a quantity\\nof good company too!\"\\n\\n\"Grandmother,\" says the young man, changing the subject, \"what a very\\npretty girl that was I found with you just now. You called her Rosa?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, child. She is daughter of a widow in the village. Maids are so\\nhard to teach, now-a-days, that I have put her about me young. She\\'s\\nan apt scholar and will do well. She shows the house already, very\\npretty. She lives with me at my table here.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I have not driven her away?\"\\n\\n\"She supposes we have family affairs to speak about, I dare say. She\\nis very modest. It is a fine quality in a young woman. And scarcer,\"\\nsays Mrs. Rouncewell, expanding her stomacher to its utmost limits,\\n\"than it formerly was!\"\\n\\nThe young man inclines his head in acknowledgment of the precepts of\\nexperience. Mrs. Rouncewell listens.\\n\\n\"Wheels!\" says she. They have long been audible to the younger ears\\nof her companion. \"What wheels on such a day as this, for gracious\\nsake?\"\\n\\nAfter a short interval, a tap at the door. \"Come in!\" A dark-eyed,\\ndark-haired, shy, village beauty comes in--so fresh in her rosy and\\nyet delicate bloom that the drops of rain which have beaten on her\\nhair look like the dew upon a flower fresh gathered.\\n\\n\"What company is this, Rosa?\" says Mrs. Rouncewell.\\n\\n\"It\\'s two young men in a gig, ma\\'am, who want to see the house--yes,\\nand if you please, I told them so!\" in quick reply to a gesture of\\ndissent from the housekeeper. \"I went to the hall-door and told them\\nit was the wrong day and the wrong hour, but the young man who was\\ndriving took off his hat in the wet and begged me to bring this card\\nto you.\"\\n\\n\"Read it, my dear Watt,\" says the housekeeper.\\n\\nRosa is so shy as she gives it to him that they drop it between them\\nand almost knock their foreheads together as they pick it up. Rosa is\\nshyer than before.\\n\\n\"Mr. Guppy\" is all the information the card yields.\\n\\n\"Guppy!\" repeats Mrs. Rouncewell, \"MR. Guppy! Nonsense, I never heard\\nof him!\"\\n\\n\"If you please, he told ME that!\" says Rosa. \"But he said that he and\\nthe other young gentleman came from London only last night by the\\nmail, on business at the magistrates\\' meeting, ten miles off, this\\nmorning, and that as their business was soon over, and they had heard\\na great deal said of Chesney Wold, and really didn\\'t know what to do\\nwith themselves, they had come through the wet to see it. They are\\nlawyers. He says he is not in Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s office, but he is\\nsure he may make use of Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s name if necessary.\"\\nFinding, now she leaves off, that she has been making quite a long\\nspeech, Rosa is shyer than ever.\\n\\nNow, Mr. Tulkinghorn is, in a manner, part and parcel of the place,\\nand besides, is supposed to have made Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s will. The old\\nlady relaxes, consents to the admission of the visitors as a favour,\\nand dismisses Rosa. The grandson, however, being smitten by a sudden\\nwish to see the house himself, proposes to join the party. The\\ngrandmother, who is pleased that he should have that interest,\\naccompanies him--though to do him justice, he is exceedingly\\nunwilling to trouble her.\\n\\n\"Much obliged to you, ma\\'am!\" says Mr. Guppy, divesting himself of\\nhis wet dreadnought in the hall. \"Us London lawyers don\\'t often get\\nan out, and when we do, we like to make the most of it, you know.\"\\n\\nThe old housekeeper, with a gracious severity of deportment, waves\\nher hand towards the great staircase. Mr. Guppy and his friend follow\\nRosa; Mrs. Rouncewell and her grandson follow them; a young gardener\\ngoes before to open the shutters.\\n\\nAs is usually the case with people who go over houses, Mr. Guppy and\\nhis friend are dead beat before they have well begun. They straggle\\nabout in wrong places, look at wrong things, don\\'t care for the right\\nthings, gape when more rooms are opened, exhibit profound depression\\nof spirits, and are clearly knocked up. In each successive chamber\\nthat they enter, Mrs. Rouncewell, who is as upright as the house\\nitself, rests apart in a window-seat or other such nook and listens\\nwith stately approval to Rosa\\'s exposition. Her grandson is so\\nattentive to it that Rosa is shyer than ever--and prettier. Thus they\\npass on from room to room, raising the pictured Dedlocks for a few\\nbrief minutes as the young gardener admits the light, and\\nreconsigning them to their graves as he shuts it out again. It\\nappears to the afflicted Mr. Guppy and his inconsolable friend that\\nthere is no end to the Dedlocks, whose family greatness seems to\\nconsist in their never having done anything to distinguish themselves\\nfor seven hundred years.\\n\\nEven the long drawing-room of Chesney Wold cannot revive Mr. Guppy\\'s\\nspirits. He is so low that he droops on the threshold and has hardly\\nstrength of mind to enter. But a portrait over the chimney-piece,\\npainted by the fashionable artist of the day, acts upon him like a\\ncharm. He recovers in a moment. He stares at it with uncommon\\ninterest; he seems to be fixed and fascinated by it.\\n\\n\"Dear me!\" says Mr. Guppy. \"Who\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"The picture over the fire-place,\" says Rosa, \"is the portrait of the\\npresent Lady Dedlock. It is considered a perfect likeness, and the\\nbest work of the master.\"\\n\\n\"Blest,\" says Mr. Guppy, staring in a kind of dismay at his friend,\\n\"if I can ever have seen her. Yet I know her! Has the picture been\\nengraved, miss?\"\\n\\n\"The picture has never been engraved. Sir Leicester has always\\nrefused permission.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" says Mr. Guppy in a low voice. \"I\\'ll be shot if it ain\\'t very\\ncurious how well I know that picture! So that\\'s Lady Dedlock, is it!\"\\n\\n\"The picture on the right is the present Sir Leicester Dedlock. The\\npicture on the left is his father, the late Sir Leicester.\"\\n\\nMr. Guppy has no eyes for either of these magnates. \"It\\'s\\nunaccountable to me,\" he says, still staring at the portrait, \"how\\nwell I know that picture! I\\'m dashed,\" adds Mr. Guppy, looking round,\\n\"if I don\\'t think I must have had a dream of that picture, you know!\"\\n\\nAs no one present takes any especial interest in Mr. Guppy\\'s dreams,\\nthe probability is not pursued. But he still remains so absorbed by\\nthe portrait that he stands immovable before it until the young\\ngardener has closed the shutters, when he comes out of the room in a\\ndazed state that is an odd though a sufficient substitute for\\ninterest and follows into the succeeding rooms with a confused stare,\\nas if he were looking everywhere for Lady Dedlock again.\\n\\nHe sees no more of her. He sees her rooms, which are the last shown,\\nas being very elegant, and he looks out of the windows from which she\\nlooked out, not long ago, upon the weather that bored her to death.\\nAll things have an end, even houses that people take infinite pains\\nto see and are tired of before they begin to see them. He has come to\\nthe end of the sight, and the fresh village beauty to the end of her\\ndescription; which is always this: \"The terrace below is much\\nadmired. It is called, from an old story in the family, the Ghost\\'s\\nWalk.\"\\n\\n\"No?\" says Mr. Guppy, greedily curious. \"What\\'s the story, miss? Is\\nit anything about a picture?\"\\n\\n\"Pray tell us the story,\" says Watt in a half whisper.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know it, sir.\" Rosa is shyer than ever.\\n\\n\"It is not related to visitors; it is almost forgotten,\" says the\\nhousekeeper, advancing. \"It has never been more than a family\\nanecdote.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll excuse my asking again if it has anything to do with a\\npicture, ma\\'am,\" observes Mr. Guppy, \"because I do assure you that\\nthe more I think of that picture the better I know it, without\\nknowing how I know it!\"\\n\\nThe story has nothing to do with a picture; the housekeeper can\\nguarantee that. Mr. Guppy is obliged to her for the information and\\nis, moreover, generally obliged. He retires with his friend, guided\\ndown another staircase by the young gardener, and presently is heard\\nto drive away. It is now dusk. Mrs. Rouncewell can trust to the\\ndiscretion of her two young hearers and may tell THEM how the terrace\\ncame to have that ghostly name.\\n\\nShe seats herself in a large chair by the fast-darkening window and\\ntells them: \"In the wicked days, my dears, of King Charles the\\nFirst--I mean, of course, in the wicked days of the rebels who\\nleagued themselves against that excellent king--Sir Morbury Dedlock\\nwas the owner of Chesney Wold. Whether there was any account of a\\nghost in the family before those days, I can\\'t say. I should think it\\nvery likely indeed.\"\\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell holds this opinion because she considers that a\\nfamily of such antiquity and importance has a right to a ghost. She\\nregards a ghost as one of the privileges of the upper classes, a\\ngenteel distinction to which the common people have no claim.\\n\\n\"Sir Morbury Dedlock,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell, \"was, I have no occasion\\nto say, on the side of the blessed martyr. But it IS supposed that\\nhis Lady, who had none of the family blood in her veins, favoured the\\nbad cause. It is said that she had relations among King Charles\\'s\\nenemies, that she was in correspondence with them, and that she gave\\nthem information. When any of the country gentlemen who followed his\\nMajesty\\'s cause met here, it is said that my Lady was always nearer\\nto the door of their council-room than they supposed. Do you hear a\\nsound like a footstep passing along the terrace, Watt?\"\\n\\nRosa draws nearer to the housekeeper.\\n\\n\"I hear the rain-drip on the stones,\" replies the young man, \"and I\\nhear a curious echo--I suppose an echo--which is very like a halting\\nstep.\"\\n\\nThe housekeeper gravely nods and continues: \"Partly on account of\\nthis division between them, and partly on other accounts, Sir Morbury\\nand his Lady led a troubled life. She was a lady of a haughty temper.\\nThey were not well suited to each other in age or character, and they\\nhad no children to moderate between them. After her favourite\\nbrother, a young gentleman, was killed in the civil wars (by Sir\\nMorbury\\'s near kinsman), her feeling was so violent that she hated\\nthe race into which she had married. When the Dedlocks were about to\\nride out from Chesney Wold in the king\\'s cause, she is supposed to\\nhave more than once stolen down into the stables in the dead of night\\nand lamed their horses; and the story is that once at such an hour,\\nher husband saw her gliding down the stairs and followed her into the\\nstall where his own favourite horse stood. There he seized her by the\\nwrist, and in a struggle or in a fall or through the horse being\\nfrightened and lashing out, she was lamed in the hip and from that\\nhour began to pine away.\"\\n\\nThe housekeeper has dropped her voice to a little more than a\\nwhisper.\\n\\n\"She had been a lady of a handsome figure and a noble carriage. She\\nnever complained of the change; she never spoke to any one of being\\ncrippled or of being in pain, but day by day she tried to walk upon\\nthe terrace, and with the help of the stone balustrade, went up and\\ndown, up and down, up and down, in sun and shadow, with greater\\ndifficulty every day. At last, one afternoon her husband (to whom she\\nhad never, on any persuasion, opened her lips since that night),\\nstanding at the great south window, saw her drop upon the pavement.\\nHe hastened down to raise her, but she repulsed him as he bent over\\nher, and looking at him fixedly and coldly, said, \\'I will die here\\nwhere I have walked. And I will walk here, though I am in my grave. I\\nwill walk here until the pride of this house is humbled. And when\\ncalamity or when disgrace is coming to it, let the Dedlocks listen\\nfor my step!\\'\"\\n\\nWatt looks at Rosa. Rosa in the deepening gloom looks down upon the\\nground, half frightened and half shy.\\n\\n\"There and then she died. And from those days,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell,\\n\"the name has come down--the Ghost\\'s Walk. If the tread is an echo,\\nit is an echo that is only heard after dark, and is often unheard for\\na long while together. But it comes back from time to time; and so\\nsure as there is sickness or death in the family, it will be heard\\nthen.\"\\n\\n\"And disgrace, grandmother--\" says Watt.\\n\\n\"Disgrace never comes to Chesney Wold,\" returns the housekeeper.\\n\\nHer grandson apologizes with \"True. True.\"\\n\\n\"That is the story. Whatever the sound is, it is a worrying sound,\"\\nsays Mrs. Rouncewell, getting up from her chair; \"and what is to be\\nnoticed in it is that it MUST BE HEARD. My Lady, who is afraid of\\nnothing, admits that when it is there, it must be heard. You cannot\\nshut it out. Watt, there is a tall French clock behind you (placed\\nthere, \\'a purpose) that has a loud beat when it is in motion and can\\nplay music. You understand how those things are managed?\"\\n\\n\"Pretty well, grandmother, I think.\"\\n\\n\"Set it a-going.\"\\n\\nWatt sets it a-going--music and all.\\n\\n\"Now, come hither,\" says the housekeeper. \"Hither, child, towards my\\nLady\\'s pillow. I am not sure that it is dark enough yet, but listen!\\nCan you hear the sound upon the terrace, through the music, and the\\nbeat, and everything?\"\\n\\n\"I certainly can!\"\\n\\n\"So my Lady says.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'model_output': \"\\nOne foggy morning in London, Ada, Esther, and Miss Jellyby go for a walk. The house is dirty and breakfast not ready because Miss Jellyby's mother Mrs. Jellyby neglects home duties while exerting herself for philanthropic schemes related to Africa. They meet Richard who joins them. As they walk through the London streets, taking in the people and shops, Miss Jellyby complains about her parents and their causes, especially her mother's focus on Africa. They meet an elderly woman named Miss Flite, who is embroiled in a long-running Chancery case over her estate called Jarndyce v Jarndyce. They go to lodgings at Krook's shop, where the windows are full of dirty bottles and signs saying it buys rags, bones, iron, and old furniture to resell. Krook recognizes the name 'Jarndyce' from the notorious Jarndyce v Jarndyce court case that has dragged on for years in Chancery. \\n\\nArriving at Bleak House, they are welcomed by Mr. Jarndyce, who Esther recognizes from years before when she was a ward in Chancery under his care. He asks their opinion on Mrs. Jellyby's neglect of her home and children. As they tour the delightfully irregular house with many rooms and passages, Esther's room has flowery chintz and Ada's has birds staring from pictures. There are curious furnishings like a Hindu chair, sofa and box, crayon portraits, and oval engravings.\\n\\nThey meet the childlike Mr. Skimpole, once a doctor but too disorganized. He relies on others, just needing a doll house to play with. When Skimpole is arrested for debt, the narrator Esther pays it, though it's not her money. Jarndyce says Skimpole has no sense of time, money or responsibility. Jarndyce checks a weathervane, saying earlier wind comments were incorrect.\\n\\nMeanwhile, at Chesney Wold, Mrs. Rouncewell has been housekeeper for 50 years. Despite heavy rain in Lincolnshire, she is unaffected by the weather. She oversees Chesney Wold, as the current owner assumes servants lack individuality. Her grandson visits just as the lawyers Guppy and friend arrive to tour Chesney Wold. Mrs. Rouncewell allows them in, and her grandson decides to join the tour. \\n\\nMr. Guppy knows the Tulkinghorns, who have some connection to Chesney Wold. Touring with Rosa, he is fascinated by a portrait of the current Lady Dedlock, feeling he recognizes her. In Lady Dedlock's rooms, he continues staring at her portrait. \\n\\nAfterwards, Mrs. Rouncewell tells her grandson and Rosa the story of the 'Ghost's Walk' terrace. She says a previous Lady Dedlock supported the king's enemies in the English Civil War and passed information to them. She was suspected of spying and of laming her husband's horses to aid the king's enemies. This previous Lady Dedlock died on the terrace at Chesney Wold under unclear circumstances. She tried to walk there despite being lame herself after her husband injured her, so it is not clear if her death was an accident or suicide. The specific details around Lady Dedlock's death on the terrace are not provided.\\n\"}, {'summary': 'Esther and Mr. Jarndyce discuss the Chancery suit, and Esther leans that it is a hopeless muddle, and anything left of the great fortune disputed within it has been consumed by legal costs. The story of Tom Jarndyce is related again; we learn that Bleak House, once called Peaks, took its name during Tom Jarndyce\\'s lifetime because he allowed it to go to rack and ruin. The street of houses in London, which we will learn later is called Tom-all-Alone\\'s, is part of the suit also. Esther learns that Mr. Jarndyce, who begs her to call him Guardian, has a little room he retreats to when he is out of sorts called \"The Growlery.\"\\n\\nMrs. Pardiggle and her five miserable sons arrive for a visit. Mrs. Pardiggle is a country version of Mrs. Jellyby, another obsessive and misguided philanthropist who neglects her children in favor of a fashionable charity. She takes the young people to a brickmaker\\'s hovel in the village, and there Ada and Esther witness not only the lives of poverty and filth and despair that the people there live, but also the death of the brickmaker\\'s baby in his mother\\'s (Jenny) lap. The girls are much moved, and Esther significantly covers the tiny corpse with her handkerchief. The young ladies are moved by the downtrodden, beaten brickmakers\\' wives (Jenny and Liz) comforting each other, and it is contrasted with their bluster and ineffectual do-gooding. They come back later to comfort Jenny.\\n\\nIn Chapter 9 Richard is unsure what to do with his life. Esther and Jarndyce had discussed what he should do for a profession, and the two agree that to ask him what he would like to do would be best. But Richard cannot decide, and it becomes apparent that the spectre of the Chancery suit, though he claims to ignore it, holds a psychic hold on him.\\n\\nMr. Boythorn has written Mr. Jandyce a letter, and he is coming for a visit. He arrives and proves to be a boisterous and agreeable companion. We learn that he was once to have been married, but his fiance \"died to him.\" The dispute over the right-of-way between Sir Leicester Dedlock and Boythorn, who are neighbors, is introduced, and Boythorn is voluble in his criticism of the baronet. However, Boythorn is fond of Lady Dedlock.\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce writes to Sir Leicester Dedlock, who is a distant relative of Richard, to ask with help placing Richard in the world. He receives no likely help from that quarter.\\n\\nIt becomes obvious to Esther that Ada and Richard have fallen in love. Mr. Guppy arrives at Bleak House on an errand for Kenge and Carboy\\'s. He proposes marriage to Esther, who firmly rejects him.\\n\\nIn Chapter 10 Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby and their law-stationery shop in London are described. Mrs. Snagsby is an awful termagent, and Mr. Snagsby is timid and cowed. They have a maid, Guster, who is prone to fits. It is a pathetic description, for Mr. Snagsby appears to be a decent man.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn\\'s London lodgings are described, where \"lawyers lie like maggots in nuts\". Mr. Tulkinghorn goes to Snagsby\\'s shop to find out who copied out the paper of Jarndyce and Jarndyce in which Lady Dedlock took such an interest. The Coavinses sherrif\\'s officers (bailiff\\'s -- repossesion agents) offices, the firm in which Neckett the debt-collector for Skimpole employed, are nearby.\\n\\nMr. Snagsby informs Mr. Tulkinghorn that a man called Nemo (the Latin for \"no one\"), who lives above Krook\\'s shop, is the copyist. Mr. Snagsby brings Mr. Tulkinghorn to Krook\\'s shop, and Mr. Tulkinghorn goes up to Nemo\\'s room, where he finds him lying on the bed with the scent of opium in the shabby room.', 'text': 'It was interesting when I dressed before daylight to peep out of\\nwindow, where my candles were reflected in the black panes like\\ntwo beacons, and finding all beyond still enshrouded in the\\nindistinctness of last night, to watch how it turned out when the day\\ncame on. As the prospect gradually revealed itself and disclosed the\\nscene over which the wind had wandered in the dark, like my memory\\nover my life, I had a pleasure in discovering the unknown objects\\nthat had been around me in my sleep. At first they were faintly\\ndiscernible in the mist, and above them the later stars still\\nglimmered. That pale interval over, the picture began to enlarge and\\nfill up so fast that at every new peep I could have found enough\\nto look at for an hour. Imperceptibly my candles became the only\\nincongruous part of the morning, the dark places in my room all\\nmelted away, and the day shone bright upon a cheerful landscape,\\nprominent in which the old Abbey Church, with its massive tower,\\nthrew a softer train of shadow on the view than seemed compatible\\nwith its rugged character. But so from rough outsides (I hope I have\\nlearnt), serene and gentle influences often proceed.\\n\\nEvery part of the house was in such order, and every one was so\\nattentive to me, that I had no trouble with my two bunches of keys,\\nthough what with trying to remember the contents of each little\\nstore-room drawer and cupboard; and what with making notes on a slate\\nabout jams, and pickles, and preserves, and bottles, and glass, and\\nchina, and a great many other things; and what with being generally a\\nmethodical, old-maidish sort of foolish little person, I was so busy\\nthat I could not believe it was breakfast-time when I heard the bell\\nring. Away I ran, however, and made tea, as I had already been\\ninstalled into the responsibility of the tea-pot; and then, as they\\nwere all rather late and nobody was down yet, I thought I would take\\na peep at the garden and get some knowledge of that too. I found it\\nquite a delightful place--in front, the pretty avenue and drive by\\nwhich we had approached (and where, by the by, we had cut up the\\ngravel so terribly with our wheels that I asked the gardener to roll\\nit); at the back, the flower-garden, with my darling at her window up\\nthere, throwing it open to smile out at me, as if she would have\\nkissed me from that distance. Beyond the flower-garden was a\\nkitchen-garden, and then a paddock, and then a snug little rick-yard,\\nand then a dear little farm-yard. As to the house itself, with its\\nthree peaks in the roof; its various-shaped windows, some so large,\\nsome so small, and all so pretty; its trellis-work, against the\\nsouth-front for roses and honey-suckle, and its homely, comfortable,\\nwelcoming look--it was, as Ada said when she came out to meet me with\\nher arm through that of its master, worthy of her cousin John, a bold\\nthing to say, though he only pinched her dear cheek for it.\\n\\nMr. Skimpole was as agreeable at breakfast as he had been overnight.\\nThere was honey on the table, and it led him into a discourse about\\nbees. He had no objection to honey, he said (and I should think he\\nhad not, for he seemed to like it), but he protested against the\\noverweening assumptions of bees. He didn\\'t at all see why the busy\\nbee should be proposed as a model to him; he supposed the bee liked\\nto make honey, or he wouldn\\'t do it--nobody asked him. It was not\\nnecessary for the bee to make such a merit of his tastes. If every\\nconfectioner went buzzing about the world banging against everything\\nthat came in his way and egotistically calling upon everybody to take\\nnotice that he was going to his work and must not be interrupted, the\\nworld would be quite an unsupportable place. Then, after all, it was\\na ridiculous position to be smoked out of your fortune with brimstone\\nas soon as you had made it. You would have a very mean opinion of a\\nManchester man if he spun cotton for no other purpose. He must say he\\nthought a drone the embodiment of a pleasanter and wiser idea. The\\ndrone said unaffectedly, \"You will excuse me; I really cannot attend\\nto the shop! I find myself in a world in which there is so much to\\nsee and so short a time to see it in that I must take the liberty of\\nlooking about me and begging to be provided for by somebody who\\ndoesn\\'t want to look about him.\" This appeared to Mr. Skimpole to be\\nthe drone philosophy, and he thought it a very good philosophy,\\nalways supposing the drone to be willing to be on good terms with the\\nbee, which, so far as he knew, the easy fellow always was, if the\\nconsequential creature would only let him, and not be so conceited\\nabout his honey!\\n\\nHe pursued this fancy with the lightest foot over a variety of ground\\nand made us all merry, though again he seemed to have as serious a\\nmeaning in what he said as he was capable of having. I left them\\nstill listening to him when I withdrew to attend to my new duties.\\nThey had occupied me for some time, and I was passing through the\\npassages on my return with my basket of keys on my arm when Mr.\\nJarndyce called me into a small room next his bed-chamber, which I\\nfound to be in part a little library of books and papers and in part\\nquite a little museum of his boots and shoes and hat-boxes.\\n\\n\"Sit down, my dear,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"This, you must know, is the\\ngrowlery. When I am out of humour, I come and growl here.\"\\n\\n\"You must be here very seldom, sir,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh, you don\\'t know me!\" he returned. \"When I am deceived or\\ndisappointed in--the wind, and it\\'s easterly, I take refuge here. The\\ngrowlery is the best-used room in the house. You are not aware of\\nhalf my humours yet. My dear, how you are trembling!\"\\n\\nI could not help it; I tried very hard, but being alone with that\\nbenevolent presence, and meeting his kind eyes, and feeling so happy\\nand so honoured there, and my heart so full--I kissed his hand. I\\ndon\\'t know what I said, or even that I spoke. He was disconcerted and\\nwalked to the window; I almost believed with an intention of jumping\\nout, until he turned and I was reassured by seeing in his eyes what\\nhe had gone there to hide. He gently patted me on the head, and I sat\\ndown.\\n\\n\"There! There!\" he said. \"That\\'s over. Pooh! Don\\'t be foolish.\"\\n\\n\"It shall not happen again, sir,\" I returned, \"but at first it is\\ndifficult--\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\" he said. \"It\\'s easy, easy. Why not? I hear of a good\\nlittle orphan girl without a protector, and I take it into my head to\\nbe that protector. She grows up, and more than justifies my good\\nopinion, and I remain her guardian and her friend. What is there in\\nall this? So, so! Now, we have cleared off old scores, and I have\\nbefore me thy pleasant, trusting, trusty face again.\"\\n\\nI said to myself, \"Esther, my dear, you surprise me! This really is\\nnot what I expected of you!\" And it had such a good effect that I\\nfolded my hands upon my basket and quite recovered myself. Mr.\\nJarndyce, expressing his approval in his face, began to talk to me as\\nconfidentially as if I had been in the habit of conversing with him\\nevery morning for I don\\'t know how long. I almost felt as if I had.\\n\\n\"Of course, Esther,\" he said, \"you don\\'t understand this Chancery\\nbusiness?\"\\n\\nAnd of course I shook my head.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know who does,\" he returned. \"The lawyers have twisted it\\ninto such a state of bedevilment that the original merits of the case\\nhave long disappeared from the face of the earth. It\\'s about a will\\nand the trusts under a will--or it was once. It\\'s about nothing but\\ncosts now. We are always appearing, and disappearing, and swearing,\\nand interrogating, and filing, and cross-filing, and arguing, and\\nsealing, and motioning, and referring, and reporting, and revolving\\nabout the Lord Chancellor and all his satellites, and equitably\\nwaltzing ourselves off to dusty death, about costs. That\\'s the great\\nquestion. All the rest, by some extraordinary means, has melted\\naway.\"\\n\\n\"But it was, sir,\" said I, to bring him back, for he began to rub his\\nhead, \"about a will?\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes, it was about a will when it was about anything,\" he\\nreturned. \"A certain Jarndyce, in an evil hour, made a great fortune,\\nand made a great will. In the question how the trusts under that will\\nare to be administered, the fortune left by the will is squandered\\naway; the legatees under the will are reduced to such a miserable\\ncondition that they would be sufficiently punished if they had\\ncommitted an enormous crime in having money left them, and the will\\nitself is made a dead letter. All through the deplorable cause,\\neverything that everybody in it, except one man, knows already is\\nreferred to that only one man who don\\'t know, it to find out--all\\nthrough the deplorable cause, everybody must have copies, over and\\nover again, of everything that has accumulated about it in the way of\\ncartloads of papers (or must pay for them without having them, which\\nis the usual course, for nobody wants them) and must go down the\\nmiddle and up again through such an infernal country-dance of costs\\nand fees and nonsense and corruption as was never dreamed of in the\\nwildest visions of a witch\\'s Sabbath. Equity sends questions to law,\\nlaw sends questions back to equity; law finds it can\\'t do this,\\nequity finds it can\\'t do that; neither can so much as say it can\\'t\\ndo anything, without this solicitor instructing and this counsel\\nappearing for A, and that solicitor instructing and that counsel\\nappearing for B; and so on through the whole alphabet, like the\\nhistory of the apple pie. And thus, through years and years, and\\nlives and lives, everything goes on, constantly beginning over and\\nover again, and nothing ever ends. And we can\\'t get out of the suit\\non any terms, for we are made parties to it, and MUST BE parties to\\nit, whether we like it or not. But it won\\'t do to think of it! When\\nmy great uncle, poor Tom Jarndyce, began to think of it, it was the\\nbeginning of the end!\"\\n\\n\"The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard?\"\\n\\nHe nodded gravely. \"I was his heir, and this was his house, Esther.\\nWhen I came here, it was bleak indeed. He had left the signs of his\\nmisery upon it.\"\\n\\n\"How changed it must be now!\" I said.\\n\\n\"It had been called, before his time, the Peaks. He gave it its\\npresent name and lived here shut up, day and night poring over the\\nwicked heaps of papers in the suit and hoping against hope to\\ndisentangle it from its mystification and bring it to a close. In the\\nmeantime, the place became dilapidated, the wind whistled through the\\ncracked walls, the rain fell through the broken roof, the weeds\\nchoked the passage to the rotting door. When I brought what remained\\nof him home here, the brains seemed to me to have been blown out of\\nthe house too, it was so shattered and ruined.\"\\n\\nHe walked a little to and fro after saying this to himself with a\\nshudder, and then looked at me, and brightened, and came and sat down\\nagain with his hands in his pockets.\\n\\n\"I told you this was the growlery, my dear. Where was I?\"\\n\\nI reminded him, at the hopeful change he had made in Bleak House.\\n\\n\"Bleak House; true. There is, in that city of London there, some\\nproperty of ours which is much at this day what Bleak House was then;\\nI say property of ours, meaning of the suit\\'s, but I ought to call it\\nthe property of costs, for costs is the only power on earth that will\\never get anything out of it now or will ever know it for anything but\\nan eyesore and a heartsore. It is a street of perishing blind houses,\\nwith their eyes stoned out, without a pane of glass, without so much\\nas a window-frame, with the bare blank shutters tumbling from their\\nhinges and falling asunder, the iron rails peeling away in flakes of\\nrust, the chimneys sinking in, the stone steps to every door (and\\nevery door might be death\\'s door) turning stagnant green, the very\\ncrutches on which the ruins are propped decaying. Although Bleak\\nHouse was not in Chancery, its master was, and it was stamped with\\nthe same seal. These are the Great Seal\\'s impressions, my dear, all\\nover England--the children know them!\"\\n\\n\"How changed it is!\" I said again.\\n\\n\"Why, so it is,\" he answered much more cheerfully; \"and it is wisdom\\nin you to keep me to the bright side of the picture.\" (The idea of my\\nwisdom!) \"These are things I never talk about or even think about,\\nexcepting in the growlery here. If you consider it right to mention\\nthem to Rick and Ada,\" looking seriously at me, \"you can. I leave it\\nto your discretion, Esther.\"\\n\\n\"I hope, sir--\" said I.\\n\\n\"I think you had better call me guardian, my dear.\"\\n\\nI felt that I was choking again--I taxed myself with it, \"Esther,\\nnow, you know you are!\"--when he feigned to say this slightly, as if\\nit were a whim instead of a thoughtful tenderness. But I gave the\\nhousekeeping keys the least shake in the world as a reminder to\\nmyself, and folding my hands in a still more determined manner on the\\nbasket, looked at him quietly.\\n\\n\"I hope, guardian,\" said I, \"that you may not trust too much to my\\ndiscretion. I hope you may not mistake me. I am afraid it will be a\\ndisappointment to you to know that I am not clever, but it really is\\nthe truth, and you would soon find it out if I had not the honesty to\\nconfess it.\"\\n\\nHe did not seem at all disappointed; quite the contrary. He told me,\\nwith a smile all over his face, that he knew me very well indeed and\\nthat I was quite clever enough for him.\\n\\n\"I hope I may turn out so,\" said I, \"but I am much afraid of it,\\nguardian.\"\\n\\n\"You are clever enough to be the good little woman of our lives here,\\nmy dear,\" he returned playfully; \"the little old woman of the child\\'s\\n(I don\\'t mean Skimpole\\'s) rhyme:\\n\\n\\n   \"\\'Little old woman, and whither so high?\\'\\n    \\'To sweep the cobwebs out of the sky.\\'\\n\\n\\n\"You will sweep them so neatly out of OUR sky in the course of your\\nhousekeeping, Esther, that one of these days we shall have to abandon\\nthe growlery and nail up the door.\"\\n\\nThis was the beginning of my being called Old Woman, and Little Old\\nWoman, and Cobweb, and Mrs. Shipton, and Mother Hubbard, and Dame\\nDurden, and so many names of that sort that my own name soon became\\nquite lost among them.\\n\\n\"However,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to return to our gossip. Here\\'s Rick,\\na fine young fellow full of promise. What\\'s to be done with him?\"\\n\\nOh, my goodness, the idea of asking my advice on such a point!\\n\\n\"Here he is, Esther,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, comfortably putting his\\nhands into his pockets and stretching out his legs. \"He must have a\\nprofession; he must make some choice for himself. There will be a\\nworld more wiglomeration about it, I suppose, but it must be done.\"\\n\\n\"More what, guardian?\" said I.\\n\\n\"More wiglomeration,\" said he. \"It\\'s the only name I know for the\\nthing. He is a ward in Chancery, my dear. Kenge and Carboy will have\\nsomething to say about it; Master Somebody--a sort of ridiculous\\nsexton, digging graves for the merits of causes in a back room at the\\nend of Quality Court, Chancery Lane--will have something to say about\\nit; counsel will have something to say about it; the Chancellor will\\nhave something to say about it; the satellites will have something to\\nsay about it; they will all have to be handsomely feed, all round,\\nabout it; the whole thing will be vastly ceremonious, wordy,\\nunsatisfactory, and expensive, and I call it, in general,\\nwiglomeration. How mankind ever came to be afflicted with\\nwiglomeration, or for whose sins these young people ever fell into a\\npit of it, I don\\'t know; so it is.\"\\n\\nHe began to rub his head again and to hint that he felt the wind. But\\nit was a delightful instance of his kindness towards me that whether\\nhe rubbed his head, or walked about, or did both, his face was sure\\nto recover its benignant expression as it looked at mine; and he was\\nsure to turn comfortable again and put his hands in his pockets and\\nstretch out his legs.\\n\\n\"Perhaps it would be best, first of all,\" said I, \"to ask Mr. Richard\\nwhat he inclines to himself.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly so,\" he returned. \"That\\'s what I mean! You know, just\\naccustom yourself to talk it over, with your tact and in your quiet\\nway, with him and Ada, and see what you all make of it. We are sure\\nto come at the heart of the matter by your means, little woman.\"\\n\\nI really was frightened at the thought of the importance I was\\nattaining and the number of things that were being confided to me. I\\nhad not meant this at all; I had meant that he should speak to\\nRichard. But of course I said nothing in reply except that I would do\\nmy best, though I feared (I really felt it necessary to repeat this)\\nthat he thought me much more sagacious than I was. At which my\\nguardian only laughed the pleasantest laugh I ever heard.\\n\\n\"Come!\" he said, rising and pushing back his chair. \"I think we may\\nhave done with the growlery for one day! Only a concluding word.\\nEsther, my dear, do you wish to ask me anything?\"\\n\\nHe looked so attentively at me that I looked attentively at him and\\nfelt sure I understood him.\\n\\n\"About myself, sir?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Guardian,\" said I, venturing to put my hand, which was suddenly\\ncolder than I could have wished, in his, \"nothing! I am quite sure\\nthat if there were anything I ought to know or had any need to know,\\nI should not have to ask you to tell it to me. If my whole reliance\\nand confidence were not placed in you, I must have a hard heart\\nindeed. I have nothing to ask you, nothing in the world.\"\\n\\nHe drew my hand through his arm and we went away to look for Ada.\\nFrom that hour I felt quite easy with him, quite unreserved, quite\\ncontent to know no more, quite happy.\\n\\nWe lived, at first, rather a busy life at Bleak House, for we had to\\nbecome acquainted with many residents in and out of the neighbourhood\\nwho knew Mr. Jarndyce. It seemed to Ada and me that everybody knew\\nhim who wanted to do anything with anybody else\\'s money. It amazed us\\nwhen we began to sort his letters and to answer some of them for him\\nin the growlery of a morning to find how the great object of the\\nlives of nearly all his correspondents appeared to be to form\\nthemselves into committees for getting in and laying out money. The\\nladies were as desperate as the gentlemen; indeed, I think they were\\neven more so. They threw themselves into committees in the most\\nimpassioned manner and collected subscriptions with a vehemence quite\\nextraordinary. It appeared to us that some of them must pass their\\nwhole lives in dealing out subscription-cards to the whole\\npost-office directory--shilling cards, half-crown cards,\\nhalf-sovereign cards, penny cards. They wanted everything. They\\nwanted wearing apparel, they wanted linen rags, they wanted money,\\nthey wanted coals, they wanted soup, they wanted interest, they\\nwanted autographs, they wanted flannel, they wanted whatever Mr.\\nJarndyce had--or had not. Their objects were as various as their\\ndemands. They were going to raise new buildings, they were going to\\npay off debts on old buildings, they were going to establish in a\\npicturesque building (engraving of proposed west elevation attached)\\nthe Sisterhood of Mediaeval Marys, they were going to give a\\ntestimonial to Mrs. Jellyby, they were going to have their\\nsecretary\\'s portrait painted and presented to his mother-in-law,\\nwhose deep devotion to him was well known, they were going to get up\\neverything, I really believe, from five hundred thousand tracts to an\\nannuity and from a marble monument to a silver tea-pot. They took a\\nmultitude of titles. They were the Women of England, the Daughters of\\nBritain, the Sisters of all the cardinal virtues separately, the\\nFemales of America, the Ladies of a hundred denominations. They\\nappeared to be always excited about canvassing and electing. They\\nseemed to our poor wits, and according to their own accounts, to be\\nconstantly polling people by tens of thousands, yet never bringing\\ntheir candidates in for anything. It made our heads ache to think, on\\nthe whole, what feverish lives they must lead.\\n\\nAmong the ladies who were most distinguished for this rapacious\\nbenevolence (if I may use the expression) was a Mrs. Pardiggle, who\\nseemed, as I judged from the number of her letters to Mr. Jarndyce,\\nto be almost as powerful a correspondent as Mrs. Jellyby herself. We\\nobserved that the wind always changed when Mrs. Pardiggle became the\\nsubject of conversation and that it invariably interrupted Mr.\\nJarndyce and prevented his going any farther, when he had remarked\\nthat there were two classes of charitable people; one, the people who\\ndid a little and made a great deal of noise; the other, the people\\nwho did a great deal and made no noise at all. We were therefore\\ncurious to see Mrs. Pardiggle, suspecting her to be a type of the\\nformer class, and were glad when she called one day with her five\\nyoung sons.\\n\\nShe was a formidable style of lady with spectacles, a prominent nose,\\nand a loud voice, who had the effect of wanting a great deal of room.\\nAnd she really did, for she knocked down little chairs with her\\nskirts that were quite a great way off. As only Ada and I were at\\nhome, we received her timidly, for she seemed to come in like cold\\nweather and to make the little Pardiggles blue as they followed.\\n\\n\"These, young ladies,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle with great volubility\\nafter the first salutations, \"are my five boys. You may have seen\\ntheir names in a printed subscription list (perhaps more than one) in\\nthe possession of our esteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce. Egbert, my eldest\\n(twelve), is the boy who sent out his pocket-money, to the amount of\\nfive and threepence, to the Tockahoopo Indians. Oswald, my second\\n(ten and a half), is the child who contributed two and nine-pence to\\nthe Great National Smithers Testimonial. Francis, my third (nine),\\none and sixpence halfpenny; Felix, my fourth (seven), eightpence to\\nthe Superannuated Widows; Alfred, my youngest (five), has voluntarily\\nenrolled himself in the Infant Bonds of Joy, and is pledged never,\\nthrough life, to use tobacco in any form.\"\\n\\nWe had never seen such dissatisfied children. It was not merely that\\nthey were weazened and shrivelled--though they were certainly that\\ntoo--but they looked absolutely ferocious with discontent. At the\\nmention of the Tockahoopo Indians, I could really have supposed\\nEgbert to be one of the most baleful members of that tribe, he gave\\nme such a savage frown. The face of each child, as the amount of his\\ncontribution was mentioned, darkened in a peculiarly vindictive\\nmanner, but his was by far the worst. I must except, however, the\\nlittle recruit into the Infant Bonds of Joy, who was stolidly and\\nevenly miserable.\\n\\n\"You have been visiting, I understand,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"at Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s?\"\\n\\nWe said yes, we had passed one night there.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Jellyby,\" pursued the lady, always speaking in the same\\ndemonstrative, loud, hard tone, so that her voice impressed my fancy\\nas if it had a sort of spectacles on too--and I may take the\\nopportunity of remarking that her spectacles were made the less\\nengaging by her eyes being what Ada called \"choking eyes,\" meaning\\nvery prominent--\"Mrs. Jellyby is a benefactor to society and deserves\\na helping hand. My boys have contributed to the African\\nproject--Egbert, one and six, being the entire allowance of nine\\nweeks; Oswald, one and a penny halfpenny, being the same; the rest,\\naccording to their little means. Nevertheless, I do not go with Mrs.\\nJellyby in all things. I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in her treatment\\nof her young family. It has been noticed. It has been observed that\\nher young family are excluded from participation in the objects to\\nwhich she is devoted. She may be right, she may be wrong; but, right\\nor wrong, this is not my course with MY young family. I take them\\neverywhere.\"\\n\\nI was afterwards convinced (and so was Ada) that from the\\nill-conditioned eldest child, these words extorted a sharp yell. He\\nturned it off into a yawn, but it began as a yell.\\n\\n\"They attend matins with me (very prettily done) at half-past six\\no\\'clock in the morning all the year round, including of course the\\ndepth of winter,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle rapidly, \"and they are with me\\nduring the revolving duties of the day. I am a School lady, I am a\\nVisiting lady, I am a Reading lady, I am a Distributing lady; I am on\\nthe local Linen Box Committee and many general committees; and my\\ncanvassing alone is very extensive--perhaps no one\\'s more so. But\\nthey are my companions everywhere; and by these means they acquire\\nthat knowledge of the poor, and that capacity of doing charitable\\nbusiness in general--in short, that taste for the sort of\\nthing--which will render them in after life a service to their\\nneighbours and a satisfaction to themselves. My young family are not\\nfrivolous; they expend the entire amount of their allowance in\\nsubscriptions, under my direction; and they have attended as many\\npublic meetings and listened to as many lectures, orations, and\\ndiscussions as generally fall to the lot of few grown people. Alfred\\n(five), who, as I mentioned, has of his own election joined the\\nInfant Bonds of Joy, was one of the very few children who manifested\\nconsciousness on that occasion after a fervid address of two hours\\nfrom the chairman of the evening.\"\\n\\nAlfred glowered at us as if he never could, or would, forgive the\\ninjury of that night.\\n\\n\"You may have observed, Miss Summerson,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"in\\nsome of the lists to which I have referred, in the possession of our\\nesteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce, that the names of my young family are\\nconcluded with the name of O. A. Pardiggle, F.R.S., one pound. That\\nis their father. We usually observe the same routine. I put down my\\nmite first; then my young family enrol their contributions, according\\nto their ages and their little means; and then Mr. Pardiggle brings\\nup the rear. Mr. Pardiggle is happy to throw in his limited donation,\\nunder my direction; and thus things are made not only pleasant to\\nourselves, but, we trust, improving to others.\"\\n\\nSuppose Mr. Pardiggle were to dine with Mr. Jellyby, and suppose Mr.\\nJellyby were to relieve his mind after dinner to Mr. Pardiggle, would\\nMr. Pardiggle, in return, make any confidential communication to Mr.\\nJellyby? I was quite confused to find myself thinking this, but it\\ncame into my head.\\n\\n\"You are very pleasantly situated here!\" said Mrs. Pardiggle.\\n\\nWe were glad to change the subject, and going to the window, pointed\\nout the beauties of the prospect, on which the spectacles appeared to\\nme to rest with curious indifference.\\n\\n\"You know Mr. Gusher?\" said our visitor.\\n\\nWe were obliged to say that we had not the pleasure of Mr. Gusher\\'s\\nacquaintance.\\n\\n\"The loss is yours, I assure you,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle with her\\ncommanding deportment. \"He is a very fervid, impassioned\\nspeaker--full of fire! Stationed in a waggon on this lawn, now,\\nwhich, from the shape of the land, is naturally adapted to a public\\nmeeting, he would improve almost any occasion you could mention for\\nhours and hours! By this time, young ladies,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle,\\nmoving back to her chair and overturning, as if by invisible agency,\\na little round table at a considerable distance with my work-basket\\non it, \"by this time you have found me out, I dare say?\"\\n\\nThis was really such a confusing question that Ada looked at me in\\nperfect dismay. As to the guilty nature of my own consciousness after\\nwhat I had been thinking, it must have been expressed in the colour\\nof my cheeks.\\n\\n\"Found out, I mean,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"the prominent point in my\\ncharacter. I am aware that it is so prominent as to be discoverable\\nimmediately. I lay myself open to detection, I know. Well! I freely\\nadmit, I am a woman of business. I love hard work; I enjoy hard work.\\nThe excitement does me good. I am so accustomed and inured to hard\\nwork that I don\\'t know what fatigue is.\"\\n\\nWe murmured that it was very astonishing and very gratifying, or\\nsomething to that effect. I don\\'t think we knew what it was either,\\nbut this is what our politeness expressed.\\n\\n\"I do not understand what it is to be tired; you cannot tire me if\\nyou try!\" said Mrs. Pardiggle. \"The quantity of exertion (which is no\\nexertion to me), the amount of business (which I regard as nothing),\\nthat I go through sometimes astonishes myself. I have seen my young\\nfamily, and Mr. Pardiggle, quite worn out with witnessing it, when I\\nmay truly say I have been as fresh as a lark!\"\\n\\nIf that dark-visaged eldest boy could look more malicious than he had\\nalready looked, this was the time when he did it. I observed that he\\ndoubled his right fist and delivered a secret blow into the crown of\\nhis cap, which was under his left arm.\\n\\n\"This gives me a great advantage when I am making my rounds,\" said\\nMrs. Pardiggle. \"If I find a person unwilling to hear what I have to\\nsay, I tell that person directly, \\'I am incapable of fatigue, my good\\nfriend, I am never tired, and I mean to go on until I have done.\\' It\\nanswers admirably! Miss Summerson, I hope I shall have your\\nassistance in my visiting rounds immediately, and Miss Clare\\'s very\\nsoon.\"\\n\\nAt first I tried to excuse myself for the present on the general\\nground of having occupations to attend to which I must not neglect.\\nBut as this was an ineffectual protest, I then said, more\\nparticularly, that I was not sure of my qualifications. That I was\\ninexperienced in the art of adapting my mind to minds very\\ndifferently situated, and addressing them from suitable points of\\nview. That I had not that delicate knowledge of the heart which must\\nbe essential to such a work. That I had much to learn, myself, before\\nI could teach others, and that I could not confide in my good\\nintentions alone. For these reasons I thought it best to be as useful\\nas I could, and to render what kind services I could to those\\nimmediately about me, and to try to let that circle of duty gradually\\nand naturally expand itself. All this I said with anything but\\nconfidence, because Mrs. Pardiggle was much older than I, and had\\ngreat experience, and was so very military in her manners.\\n\\n\"You are wrong, Miss Summerson,\" said she, \"but perhaps you are not\\nequal to hard work or the excitement of it, and that makes a vast\\ndifference. If you would like to see how I go through my work, I am\\nnow about--with my young family--to visit a brickmaker in the\\nneighbourhood (a very bad character) and shall be glad to take you\\nwith me. Miss Clare also, if she will do me the favour.\"\\n\\nAda and I interchanged looks, and as we were going out in any case,\\naccepted the offer. When we hastily returned from putting on our\\nbonnets, we found the young family languishing in a corner and Mrs.\\nPardiggle sweeping about the room, knocking down nearly all the light\\nobjects it contained. Mrs. Pardiggle took possession of Ada, and I\\nfollowed with the family.\\n\\nAda told me afterwards that Mrs. Pardiggle talked in the same loud\\ntone (that, indeed, I overheard) all the way to the brickmaker\\'s\\nabout an exciting contest which she had for two or three years waged\\nagainst another lady relative to the bringing in of their rival\\ncandidates for a pension somewhere. There had been a quantity of\\nprinting, and promising, and proxying, and polling, and it appeared\\nto have imparted great liveliness to all concerned, except the\\npensioners--who were not elected yet.\\n\\nI am very fond of being confided in by children and am happy in being\\nusually favoured in that respect, but on this occasion it gave me\\ngreat uneasiness. As soon as we were out of doors, Egbert, with the\\nmanner of a little footpad, demanded a shilling of me on the ground\\nthat his pocket-money was \"boned\" from him. On my pointing out the\\ngreat impropriety of the word, especially in connexion with his\\nparent (for he added sulkily \"By her!\"), he pinched me and said, \"Oh,\\nthen! Now! Who are you! YOU wouldn\\'t like it, I think? What does she\\nmake a sham for, and pretend to give me money, and take it away\\nagain? Why do you call it my allowance, and never let me spend it?\"\\nThese exasperating questions so inflamed his mind and the minds of\\nOswald and Francis that they all pinched me at once, and in a\\ndreadfully expert way--screwing up such little pieces of my arms that\\nI could hardly forbear crying out. Felix, at the same time, stamped\\nupon my toes. And the Bond of Joy, who on account of always having\\nthe whole of his little income anticipated stood in fact pledged to\\nabstain from cakes as well as tobacco, so swelled with grief and rage\\nwhen we passed a pastry-cook\\'s shop that he terrified me by becoming\\npurple. I never underwent so much, both in body and mind, in the\\ncourse of a walk with young people as from these unnaturally\\nconstrained children when they paid me the compliment of being\\nnatural.\\n\\nI was glad when we came to the brickmaker\\'s house, though it was one\\nof a cluster of wretched hovels in a brick-field, with pigsties close\\nto the broken windows and miserable little gardens before the doors\\ngrowing nothing but stagnant pools. Here and there an old tub was put\\nto catch the droppings of rain-water from a roof, or they were banked\\nup with mud into a little pond like a large dirt-pie. At the doors\\nand windows some men and women lounged or prowled about, and took\\nlittle notice of us except to laugh to one another or to say\\nsomething as we passed about gentlefolks minding their own business\\nand not troubling their heads and muddying their shoes with coming to\\nlook after other people\\'s.\\n\\nMrs. Pardiggle, leading the way with a great show of moral\\ndetermination and talking with much volubility about the untidy\\nhabits of the people (though I doubted if the best of us could have\\nbeen tidy in such a place), conducted us into a cottage at the\\nfarthest corner, the ground-floor room of which we nearly filled.\\nBesides ourselves, there were in this damp, offensive room a woman\\nwith a black eye, nursing a poor little gasping baby by the fire; a\\nman, all stained with clay and mud and looking very dissipated, lying\\nat full length on the ground, smoking a pipe; a powerful young man\\nfastening a collar on a dog; and a bold girl doing some kind of\\nwashing in very dirty water. They all looked up at us as we came in,\\nand the woman seemed to turn her face towards the fire as if to hide\\nher bruised eye; nobody gave us any welcome.\\n\\n\"Well, my friends,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, but her voice had not a\\nfriendly sound, I thought; it was much too business-like and\\nsystematic. \"How do you do, all of you? I am here again. I told you,\\nyou couldn\\'t tire me, you know. I am fond of hard work, and am true\\nto my word.\"\\n\\n\"There an\\'t,\" growled the man on the floor, whose head rested on his\\nhand as he stared at us, \"any more on you to come in, is there?\"\\n\\n\"No, my friend,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, seating herself on one stool\\nand knocking down another. \"We are all here.\"\\n\\n\"Because I thought there warn\\'t enough of you, perhaps?\" said the\\nman, with his pipe between his lips as he looked round upon us.\\n\\nThe young man and the girl both laughed. Two friends of the young\\nman, whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with\\ntheir hands in their pockets, echoed the laugh noisily.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t tire me, good people,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle to these\\nlatter. \"I enjoy hard work, and the harder you make mine, the better\\nI like it.\"\\n\\n\"Then make it easy for her!\" growled the man upon the floor. \"I wants\\nit done, and over. I wants a end of these liberties took with my\\nplace. I wants an end of being drawed like a badger. Now you\\'re\\na-going to poll-pry and question according to custom--I know what\\nyou\\'re a-going to be up to. Well! You haven\\'t got no occasion to be\\nup to it. I\\'ll save you the trouble. Is my daughter a-washin? Yes,\\nshe IS a-washin. Look at the water. Smell it! That\\'s wot we drinks.\\nHow do you like it, and what do you think of gin instead! An\\'t my\\nplace dirty? Yes, it is dirty--it\\'s nat\\'rally dirty, and it\\'s\\nnat\\'rally onwholesome; and we\\'ve had five dirty and onwholesome\\nchildren, as is all dead infants, and so much the better for them,\\nand for us besides. Have I read the little book wot you left? No, I\\nan\\'t read the little book wot you left. There an\\'t nobody here as\\nknows how to read it; and if there wos, it wouldn\\'t be suitable to\\nme. It\\'s a book fit for a babby, and I\\'m not a babby. If you was to\\nleave me a doll, I shouldn\\'t nuss it. How have I been conducting of\\nmyself? Why, I\\'ve been drunk for three days; and I\\'da been drunk four\\nif I\\'da had the money. Don\\'t I never mean for to go to church? No, I\\ndon\\'t never mean for to go to church. I shouldn\\'t be expected there,\\nif I did; the beadle\\'s too gen-teel for me. And how did my wife get\\nthat black eye? Why, I give it her; and if she says I didn\\'t, she\\'s a\\nlie!\"\\n\\nHe had pulled his pipe out of his mouth to say all this, and he now\\nturned over on his other side and smoked again. Mrs. Pardiggle, who\\nhad been regarding him through her spectacles with a forcible\\ncomposure, calculated, I could not help thinking, to increase his\\nantagonism, pulled out a good book as if it were a constable\\'s staff\\nand took the whole family into custody. I mean into religious\\ncustody, of course; but she really did it as if she were an\\ninexorable moral policeman carrying them all off to a station-house.\\n\\nAda and I were very uncomfortable. We both felt intrusive and out of\\nplace, and we both thought that Mrs. Pardiggle would have got on\\ninfinitely better if she had not had such a mechanical way of taking\\npossession of people. The children sulked and stared; the family took\\nno notice of us whatever, except when the young man made the dog\\nbark, which he usually did when Mrs. Pardiggle was most emphatic. We\\nboth felt painfully sensible that between us and these people there\\nwas an iron barrier which could not be removed by our new friend. By\\nwhom or how it could be removed, we did not know, but we knew that.\\nEven what she read and said seemed to us to be ill-chosen for such\\nauditors, if it had been imparted ever so modestly and with ever so\\nmuch tact. As to the little book to which the man on the floor had\\nreferred, we acquired a knowledge of it afterwards, and Mr. Jarndyce\\nsaid he doubted if Robinson Crusoe could have read it, though he had\\nhad no other on his desolate island.\\n\\nWe were much relieved, under these circumstances, when Mrs. Pardiggle\\nleft off.\\n\\nThe man on the floor, then turning his head round again, said\\nmorosely, \"Well! You\\'ve done, have you?\"\\n\\n\"For to-day, I have, my friend. But I am never fatigued. I shall come\\nto you again in your regular order,\" returned Mrs. Pardiggle with\\ndemonstrative cheerfulness.\\n\\n\"So long as you goes now,\" said he, folding his arms and shutting his\\neyes with an oath, \"you may do wot you like!\"\\n\\nMrs. Pardiggle accordingly rose and made a little vortex in the\\nconfined room from which the pipe itself very narrowly escaped.\\nTaking one of her young family in each hand, and telling the others\\nto follow closely, and expressing her hope that the brickmaker and\\nall his house would be improved when she saw them next, she then\\nproceeded to another cottage. I hope it is not unkind in me to say\\nthat she certainly did make, in this as in everything else, a show\\nthat was not conciliatory of doing charity by wholesale and of\\ndealing in it to a large extent.\\n\\nShe supposed that we were following her, but as soon as the space was\\nleft clear, we approached the woman sitting by the fire to ask if the\\nbaby were ill.\\n\\nShe only looked at it as it lay on her lap. We had observed before\\nthat when she looked at it she covered her discoloured eye with her\\nhand, as though she wished to separate any association with noise and\\nviolence and ill treatment from the poor little child.\\n\\nAda, whose gentle heart was moved by its appearance, bent down to\\ntouch its little face. As she did so, I saw what happened and drew\\nher back. The child died.\\n\\n\"Oh, Esther!\" cried Ada, sinking on her knees beside it. \"Look here!\\nOh, Esther, my love, the little thing! The suffering, quiet, pretty\\nlittle thing! I am so sorry for it. I am so sorry for the mother. I\\nnever saw a sight so pitiful as this before! Oh, baby, baby!\"\\n\\nSuch compassion, such gentleness, as that with which she bent down\\nweeping and put her hand upon the mother\\'s might have softened any\\nmother\\'s heart that ever beat. The woman at first gazed at her in\\nastonishment and then burst into tears.\\n\\nPresently I took the light burden from her lap, did what I could to\\nmake the baby\\'s rest the prettier and gentler, laid it on a shelf,\\nand covered it with my own handkerchief. We tried to comfort the\\nmother, and we whispered to her what Our Saviour said of children.\\nShe answered nothing, but sat weeping--weeping very much.\\n\\nWhen I turned, I found that the young man had taken out the dog and\\nwas standing at the door looking in upon us with dry eyes, but quiet.\\nThe girl was quiet too and sat in a corner looking on the ground. The\\nman had risen. He still smoked his pipe with an air of defiance, but\\nhe was silent.\\n\\nAn ugly woman, very poorly clothed, hurried in while I was glancing\\nat them, and coming straight up to the mother, said, \"Jenny! Jenny!\"\\nThe mother rose on being so addressed and fell upon the woman\\'s neck.\\n\\nShe also had upon her face and arms the marks of ill usage. She had\\nno kind of grace about her, but the grace of sympathy; but when she\\ncondoled with the woman, and her own tears fell, she wanted no\\nbeauty. I say condoled, but her only words were \"Jenny! Jenny!\" All\\nthe rest was in the tone in which she said them.\\n\\nI thought it very touching to see these two women, coarse and shabby\\nand beaten, so united; to see what they could be to one another; to\\nsee how they felt for one another, how the heart of each to each was\\nsoftened by the hard trials of their lives. I think the best side of\\nsuch people is almost hidden from us. What the poor are to the poor\\nis little known, excepting to themselves and God.\\n\\nWe felt it better to withdraw and leave them uninterrupted. We stole\\nout quietly and without notice from any one except the man. He was\\nleaning against the wall near the door, and finding that there was\\nscarcely room for us to pass, went out before us. He seemed to want\\nto hide that he did this on our account, but we perceived that he\\ndid, and thanked him. He made no answer.\\n\\nAda was so full of grief all the way home, and Richard, whom we found\\nat home, was so distressed to see her in tears (though he said to me,\\nwhen she was not present, how beautiful it was too!), that we\\narranged to return at night with some little comforts and repeat our\\nvisit at the brick-maker\\'s house. We said as little as we could to\\nMr. Jarndyce, but the wind changed directly.\\n\\nRichard accompanied us at night to the scene of our morning\\nexpedition. On our way there, we had to pass a noisy drinking-house,\\nwhere a number of men were flocking about the door. Among them, and\\nprominent in some dispute, was the father of the little child. At a\\nshort distance, we passed the young man and the dog, in congenial\\ncompany. The sister was standing laughing and talking with some other\\nyoung women at the corner of the row of cottages, but she seemed\\nashamed and turned away as we went by.\\n\\nWe left our escort within sight of the brickmaker\\'s dwelling and\\nproceeded by ourselves. When we came to the door, we found the woman\\nwho had brought such consolation with her standing there looking\\nanxiously out.\\n\\n\"It\\'s you, young ladies, is it?\" she said in a whisper. \"I\\'m\\na-watching for my master. My heart\\'s in my mouth. If he was to catch\\nme away from home, he\\'d pretty near murder me.\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean your husband?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Yes, miss, my master. Jenny\\'s asleep, quite worn out. She\\'s scarcely\\nhad the child off her lap, poor thing, these seven days and nights,\\nexcept when I\\'ve been able to take it for a minute or two.\"\\n\\nAs she gave way for us, she went softly in and put what we had\\nbrought near the miserable bed on which the mother slept. No effort\\nhad been made to clean the room--it seemed in its nature almost\\nhopeless of being clean; but the small waxen form from which so much\\nsolemnity diffused itself had been composed afresh, and washed, and\\nneatly dressed in some fragments of white linen; and on my\\nhandkerchief, which still covered the poor baby, a little bunch of\\nsweet herbs had been laid by the same rough, scarred hands, so\\nlightly, so tenderly!\\n\\n\"May heaven reward you!\" we said to her. \"You are a good woman.\"\\n\\n\"Me, young ladies?\" she returned with surprise. \"Hush! Jenny, Jenny!\"\\n\\nThe mother had moaned in her sleep and moved. The sound of the\\nfamiliar voice seemed to calm her again. She was quiet once more.\\n\\nHow little I thought, when I raised my handkerchief to look upon the\\ntiny sleeper underneath and seemed to see a halo shine around the\\nchild through Ada\\'s drooping hair as her pity bent her head--how\\nlittle I thought in whose unquiet bosom that handkerchief would come\\nto lie after covering the motionless and peaceful breast! I only\\nthought that perhaps the Angel of the child might not be all\\nunconscious of the woman who replaced it with so compassionate a\\nhand; not all unconscious of her presently, when we had taken leave,\\nand left her at the door, by turns looking, and listening in terror\\nfor herself, and saying in her old soothing manner, \"Jenny, Jenny!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know how it is I seem to be always writing about myself. I\\nmean all the time to write about other people, and I try to think\\nabout myself as little as possible, and I am sure, when I find myself\\ncoming into the story again, I am really vexed and say, \"Dear, dear,\\nyou tiresome little creature, I wish you wouldn\\'t!\" but it is all of\\nno use. I hope any one who may read what I write will understand that\\nif these pages contain a great deal about me, I can only suppose it\\nmust be because I have really something to do with them and can\\'t be\\nkept out.\\n\\nMy darling and I read together, and worked, and practised, and found\\nso much employment for our time that the winter days flew by us like\\nbright-winged birds. Generally in the afternoons, and always in the\\nevenings, Richard gave us his company. Although he was one of the\\nmost restless creatures in the world, he certainly was very fond of\\nour society.\\n\\nHe was very, very, very fond of Ada. I mean it, and I had better say\\nit at once. I had never seen any young people falling in love before,\\nbut I found them out quite soon. I could not say so, of course, or\\nshow that I knew anything about it. On the contrary, I was so demure\\nand used to seem so unconscious that sometimes I considered within\\nmyself while I was sitting at work whether I was not growing quite\\ndeceitful.\\n\\nBut there was no help for it. All I had to do was to be quiet, and I\\nwas as quiet as a mouse. They were as quiet as mice too, so far as\\nany words were concerned, but the innocent manner in which they\\nrelied more and more upon me as they took more and more to one\\nanother was so charming that I had great difficulty in not showing\\nhow it interested me.\\n\\n\"Our dear little old woman is such a capital old woman,\" Richard\\nwould say, coming up to meet me in the garden early, with his\\npleasant laugh and perhaps the least tinge of a blush, \"that I can\\'t\\nget on without her. Before I begin my harum-scarum day--grinding away\\nat those books and instruments and then galloping up hill and down\\ndale, all the country round, like a highwayman--it does me so much\\ngood to come and have a steady walk with our comfortable friend, that\\nhere I am again!\"\\n\\n\"You know, Dame Durden, dear,\" Ada would say at night, with her head\\nupon my shoulder and the firelight shining in her thoughtful eyes, \"I\\ndon\\'t want to talk when we come upstairs here. Only to sit a little\\nwhile thinking, with your dear face for company, and to hear the wind\\nand remember the poor sailors at sea--\"\\n\\nAh! Perhaps Richard was going to be a sailor. We had talked it over\\nvery often now, and there was some talk of gratifying the inclination\\nof his childhood for the sea. Mr. Jarndyce had written to a relation\\nof the family, a great Sir Leicester Dedlock, for his interest in\\nRichard\\'s favour, generally; and Sir Leicester had replied in a\\ngracious manner that he would be happy to advance the prospects of\\nthe young gentleman if it should ever prove to be within his power,\\nwhich was not at all probable, and that my Lady sent her compliments\\nto the young gentleman (to whom she perfectly remembered that she was\\nallied by remote consanguinity) and trusted that he would ever do his\\nduty in any honourable profession to which he might devote himself.\\n\\n\"So I apprehend it\\'s pretty clear,\" said Richard to me, \"that I shall\\nhave to work my own way. Never mind! Plenty of people have had to do\\nthat before now, and have done it. I only wish I had the command of a\\nclipping privateer to begin with and could carry off the Chancellor\\nand keep him on short allowance until he gave judgment in our cause.\\nHe\\'d find himself growing thin, if he didn\\'t look sharp!\"\\n\\nWith a buoyancy and hopefulness and a gaiety that hardly ever\\nflagged, Richard had a carelessness in his character that quite\\nperplexed me, principally because he mistook it, in such a very odd\\nway, for prudence. It entered into all his calculations about money\\nin a singular manner which I don\\'t think I can better explain than by\\nreverting for a moment to our loan to Mr. Skimpole.\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce had ascertained the amount, either from Mr. Skimpole\\nhimself or from Coavinses, and had placed the money in my hands with\\ninstructions to me to retain my own part of it and hand the rest to\\nRichard. The number of little acts of thoughtless expenditure which\\nRichard justified by the recovery of his ten pounds, and the number\\nof times he talked to me as if he had saved or realized that amount,\\nwould form a sum in simple addition.\\n\\n\"My prudent Mother Hubbard, why not?\" he said to me when he wanted,\\nwithout the least consideration, to bestow five pounds on the\\nbrickmaker. \"I made ten pounds, clear, out of Coavinses\\' business.\"\\n\\n\"How was that?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Why, I got rid of ten pounds which I was quite content to get rid of\\nand never expected to see any more. You don\\'t deny that?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Very well! Then I came into possession of ten pounds--\"\\n\\n\"The same ten pounds,\" I hinted.\\n\\n\"That has nothing to do with it!\" returned Richard. \"I have got ten\\npounds more than I expected to have, and consequently I can afford to\\nspend it without being particular.\"\\n\\nIn exactly the same way, when he was persuaded out of the sacrifice\\nof these five pounds by being convinced that it would do no good, he\\ncarried that sum to his credit and drew upon it.\\n\\n\"Let me see!\" he would say. \"I saved five pounds out of the\\nbrickmaker\\'s affair, so if I have a good rattle to London and back in\\na post-chaise and put that down at four pounds, I shall have saved\\none. And it\\'s a very good thing to save one, let me tell you: a penny\\nsaved is a penny got!\"\\n\\nI believe Richard\\'s was as frank and generous a nature as there\\npossibly can be. He was ardent and brave, and in the midst of all his\\nwild restlessness, was so gentle that I knew him like a brother in a\\nfew weeks. His gentleness was natural to him and would have shown\\nitself abundantly even without Ada\\'s influence; but with it, he\\nbecame one of the most winning of companions, always so ready to be\\ninterested and always so happy, sanguine, and light-hearted. I am\\nsure that I, sitting with them, and walking with them, and talking\\nwith them, and noticing from day to day how they went on, falling\\ndeeper and deeper in love, and saying nothing about it, and each\\nshyly thinking that this love was the greatest of secrets, perhaps\\nnot yet suspected even by the other--I am sure that I was scarcely\\nless enchanted than they were and scarcely less pleased with the\\npretty dream.\\n\\nWe were going on in this way, when one morning at breakfast Mr.\\nJarndyce received a letter, and looking at the superscription, said,\\n\"From Boythorn? Aye, aye!\" and opened and read it with evident\\npleasure, announcing to us in a parenthesis when he was about\\nhalf-way through, that Boythorn was \"coming down\" on a visit. Now who\\nwas Boythorn, we all thought. And I dare say we all thought too--I am\\nsure I did, for one--would Boythorn at all interfere with what was\\ngoing forward?\\n\\n\"I went to school with this fellow, Lawrence Boythorn,\" said Mr.\\nJarndyce, tapping the letter as he laid it on the table, \"more than\\nfive and forty years ago. He was then the most impetuous boy in the\\nworld, and he is now the most impetuous man. He was then the loudest\\nboy in the world, and he is now the loudest man. He was then the\\nheartiest and sturdiest boy in the world, and he is now the heartiest\\nand sturdiest man. He is a tremendous fellow.\"\\n\\n\"In stature, sir?\" asked Richard.\\n\\n\"Pretty well, Rick, in that respect,\" said Mr. Jarndyce; \"being some\\nten years older than I and a couple of inches taller, with his head\\nthrown back like an old soldier, his stalwart chest squared, his\\nhands like a clean blacksmith\\'s, and his lungs! There\\'s no simile for\\nhis lungs. Talking, laughing, or snoring, they make the beams of the\\nhouse shake.\"\\n\\nAs Mr. Jarndyce sat enjoying the image of his friend Boythorn, we\\nobserved the favourable omen that there was not the least indication\\nof any change in the wind.\\n\\n\"But it\\'s the inside of the man, the warm heart of the man, the\\npassion of the man, the fresh blood of the man, Rick--and Ada, and\\nlittle Cobweb too, for you are all interested in a visitor--that I\\nspeak of,\" he pursued. \"His language is as sounding as his voice. He\\nis always in extremes, perpetually in the superlative degree. In his\\ncondemnation he is all ferocity. You might suppose him to be an ogre\\nfrom what he says, and I believe he has the reputation of one with\\nsome people. There! I tell you no more of him beforehand. You must\\nnot be surprised to see him take me under his protection, for he has\\nnever forgotten that I was a low boy at school and that our\\nfriendship began in his knocking two of my head tyrant\\'s teeth out\\n(he says six) before breakfast. Boythorn and his man,\" to me, \"will\\nbe here this afternoon, my dear.\"\\n\\nI took care that the necessary preparations were made for Mr.\\nBoythorn\\'s reception, and we looked forward to his arrival with some\\ncuriosity. The afternoon wore away, however, and he did not appear.\\nThe dinner-hour arrived, and still he did not appear. The dinner was\\nput back an hour, and we were sitting round the fire with no light\\nbut the blaze when the hall-door suddenly burst open and the hall\\nresounded with these words, uttered with the greatest vehemence and\\nin a stentorian tone: \"We have been misdirected, Jarndyce, by a most\\nabandoned ruffian, who told us to take the turning to the right\\ninstead of to the left. He is the most intolerable scoundrel on the\\nface of the earth. His father must have been a most consummate\\nvillain, ever to have such a son. I would have had that fellow shot\\nwithout the least remorse!\"\\n\\n\"Did he do it on purpose?\" Mr. Jarndyce inquired.\\n\\n\"I have not the slightest doubt that the scoundrel has passed his\\nwhole existence in misdirecting travellers!\" returned the other. \"By\\nmy soul, I thought him the worst-looking dog I had ever beheld when\\nhe was telling me to take the turning to the right. And yet I stood\\nbefore that fellow face to face and didn\\'t knock his brains out!\"\\n\\n\"Teeth, you mean?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, really making the whole\\nhouse vibrate. \"What, you have not forgotten it yet! Ha, ha, ha! And\\nthat was another most consummate vagabond! By my soul, the\\ncountenance of that fellow when he was a boy was the blackest image\\nof perfidy, cowardice, and cruelty ever set up as a scarecrow in a\\nfield of scoundrels. If I were to meet that most unparalleled despot\\nin the streets to-morrow, I would fell him like a rotten tree!\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"Now, will you come\\nupstairs?\"\\n\\n\"By my soul, Jarndyce,\" returned his guest, who seemed to refer to\\nhis watch, \"if you had been married, I would have turned back at the\\ngarden-gate and gone away to the remotest summits of the Himalaya\\nMountains sooner than I would have presented myself at this\\nunseasonable hour.\"\\n\\n\"Not quite so far, I hope?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"By my life and honour, yes!\" cried the visitor. \"I wouldn\\'t be\\nguilty of the audacious insolence of keeping a lady of the house\\nwaiting all this time for any earthly consideration. I would\\ninfinitely rather destroy myself--infinitely rather!\"\\n\\nTalking thus, they went upstairs, and presently we heard him in his\\nbedroom thundering \"Ha, ha, ha!\" and again \"Ha, ha, ha!\" until the\\nflattest echo in the neighbourhood seemed to catch the contagion and\\nto laugh as enjoyingly as he did or as we did when we heard him\\nlaugh.\\n\\nWe all conceived a prepossession in his favour, for there was a\\nsterling quality in this laugh, and in his vigorous, healthy voice,\\nand in the roundness and fullness with which he uttered every word he\\nspoke, and in the very fury of his superlatives, which seemed to go\\noff like blank cannons and hurt nothing. But we were hardly prepared\\nto have it so confirmed by his appearance when Mr. Jarndyce presented\\nhim. He was not only a very handsome old gentleman--upright and\\nstalwart as he had been described to us--with a massive grey head, a\\nfine composure of face when silent, a figure that might have become\\ncorpulent but for his being so continually in earnest that he gave it\\nno rest, and a chin that might have subsided into a double chin but\\nfor the vehement emphasis in which it was constantly required to\\nassist; but he was such a true gentleman in his manner, so\\nchivalrously polite, his face was lighted by a smile of so much\\nsweetness and tenderness, and it seemed so plain that he had nothing\\nto hide, but showed himself exactly as he was--incapable, as Richard\\nsaid, of anything on a limited scale, and firing away with those\\nblank great guns because he carried no small arms whatever--that\\nreally I could not help looking at him with equal pleasure as he sat\\nat dinner, whether he smilingly conversed with Ada and me, or was led\\nby Mr. Jarndyce into some great volley of superlatives, or threw up\\nhis head like a bloodhound and gave out that tremendous \"Ha, ha, ha!\"\\n\\n\"You have brought your bird with you, I suppose?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"By heaven, he is the most astonishing bird in Europe!\" replied the\\nother. \"He IS the most wonderful creature! I wouldn\\'t take ten\\nthousand guineas for that bird. I have left an annuity for his sole\\nsupport in case he should outlive me. He is, in sense and attachment,\\na phenomenon. And his father before him was one of the most\\nastonishing birds that ever lived!\"\\n\\nThe subject of this laudation was a very little canary, who was so\\ntame that he was brought down by Mr. Boythorn\\'s man, on his\\nforefinger, and after taking a gentle flight round the room, alighted\\non his master\\'s head. To hear Mr. Boythorn presently expressing the\\nmost implacable and passionate sentiments, with this fragile mite of\\na creature quietly perched on his forehead, was to have a good\\nillustration of his character, I thought.\\n\\n\"By my soul, Jarndyce,\" he said, very gently holding up a bit of\\nbread to the canary to peck at, \"if I were in your place I would\\nseize every master in Chancery by the throat to-morrow morning and\\nshake him until his money rolled out of his pockets and his bones\\nrattled in his skin. I would have a settlement out of somebody, by\\nfair means or by foul. If you would empower me to do it, I would do\\nit for you with the greatest satisfaction!\" (All this time the very\\nsmall canary was eating out of his hand.)\\n\\n\"I thank you, Lawrence, but the suit is hardly at such a point at\\npresent,\" returned Mr. Jarndyce, laughing, \"that it would be greatly\\nadvanced even by the legal process of shaking the bench and the whole\\nbar.\"\\n\\n\"There never was such an infernal cauldron as that Chancery on the\\nface of the earth!\" said Mr. Boythorn. \"Nothing but a mine below it\\non a busy day in term time, with all its records, rules, and\\nprecedents collected in it and every functionary belonging to it\\nalso, high and low, upward and downward, from its son the\\nAccountant-General to its father the Devil, and the whole blown to\\natoms with ten thousand hundredweight of gunpowder, would reform it\\nin the least!\"\\n\\nIt was impossible not to laugh at the energetic gravity with which he\\nrecommended this strong measure of reform. When we laughed, he threw\\nup his head and shook his broad chest, and again the whole country\\nseemed to echo to his \"Ha, ha, ha!\" It had not the least effect in\\ndisturbing the bird, whose sense of security was complete and who\\nhopped about the table with its quick head now on this side and now\\non that, turning its bright sudden eye on its master as if he were no\\nmore than another bird.\\n\\n\"But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right of\\nway?\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"You are not free from the toils of the law\\nyourself!\"\\n\\n\"The fellow has brought actions against ME for trespass, and I have\\nbrought actions against HIM for trespass,\" returned Mr. Boythorn. \"By\\nheaven, he is the proudest fellow breathing. It is morally impossible\\nthat his name can be Sir Leicester. It must be Sir Lucifer.\"\\n\\n\"Complimentary to our distant relation!\" said my guardian laughingly\\nto Ada and Richard.\\n\\n\"I would beg Miss Clare\\'s pardon and Mr. Carstone\\'s pardon,\" resumed\\nour visitor, \"if I were not reassured by seeing in the fair face of\\nthe lady and the smile of the gentleman that it is quite unnecessary\\nand that they keep their distant relation at a comfortable distance.\"\\n\\n\"Or he keeps us,\" suggested Richard.\\n\\n\"By my soul,\" exclaimed Mr. Boythorn, suddenly firing another volley,\\n\"that fellow is, and his father was, and his grandfather was, the\\nmost stiff-necked, arrogant imbecile, pig-headed numskull, ever, by\\nsome inexplicable mistake of Nature, born in any station of life but\\na walking-stick\\'s! The whole of that family are the most solemnly\\nconceited and consummate blockheads! But it\\'s no matter; he should\\nnot shut up my path if he were fifty baronets melted into one and\\nliving in a hundred Chesney Wolds, one within another, like the ivory\\nballs in a Chinese carving. The fellow, by his agent, or secretary,\\nor somebody, writes to me \\'Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, presents\\nhis compliments to Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, and has to call his\\nattention to the fact that the green pathway by the old\\nparsonage-house, now the property of Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, is Sir\\nLeicester\\'s right of way, being in fact a portion of the park of\\nChesney Wold, and that Sir Leicester finds it convenient to close up\\nthe same.\\' I write to the fellow, \\'Mr. Lawrence Boythorn presents his\\ncompliments to Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, and has to call HIS\\nattention to the fact that he totally denies the whole of Sir\\nLeicester Dedlock\\'s positions on every possible subject and has to\\nadd, in reference to closing up the pathway, that he will be glad to\\nsee the man who may undertake to do it.\\' The fellow sends a most\\nabandoned villain with one eye to construct a gateway. I play upon\\nthat execrable scoundrel with a fire-engine until the breath is\\nnearly driven out of his body. The fellow erects a gate in the night.\\nI chop it down and burn it in the morning. He sends his myrmidons to\\ncome over the fence and pass and repass. I catch them in humane man\\ntraps, fire split peas at their legs, play upon them with the\\nengine--resolve to free mankind from the insupportable burden of the\\nexistence of those lurking ruffians. He brings actions for trespass;\\nI bring actions for trespass. He brings actions for assault and\\nbattery; I defend them and continue to assault and batter. Ha, ha,\\nha!\"\\n\\nTo hear him say all this with unimaginable energy, one might have\\nthought him the angriest of mankind. To see him at the very same\\ntime, looking at the bird now perched upon his thumb and softly\\nsmoothing its feathers with his forefinger, one might have thought\\nhim the gentlest. To hear him laugh and see the broad good nature of\\nhis face then, one might have supposed that he had not a care in the\\nworld, or a dispute, or a dislike, but that his whole existence was a\\nsummer joke.\\n\\n\"No, no,\" he said, \"no closing up of my paths by any Dedlock! Though\\nI willingly confess,\" here he softened in a moment, \"that Lady\\nDedlock is the most accomplished lady in the world, to whom I would\\ndo any homage that a plain gentleman, and no baronet with a head\\nseven hundred years thick, may. A man who joined his regiment at\\ntwenty and within a week challenged the most imperious and\\npresumptuous coxcomb of a commanding officer that ever drew the\\nbreath of life through a tight waist--and got broke for it--is not\\nthe man to be walked over by all the Sir Lucifers, dead or alive,\\nlocked or unlocked. Ha, ha, ha!\"\\n\\n\"Nor the man to allow his junior to be walked over either?\" said my\\nguardian.\\n\\n\"Most assuredly not!\" said Mr. Boythorn, clapping him on the shoulder\\nwith an air of protection that had something serious in it, though he\\nlaughed. \"He will stand by the low boy, always. Jarndyce, you may\\nrely upon him! But speaking of this trespass--with apologies to Miss\\nClare and Miss Summerson for the length at which I have pursued so\\ndry a subject--is there nothing for me from your men Kenge and\\nCarboy?\"\\n\\n\"I think not, Esther?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Nothing, guardian.\"\\n\\n\"Much obliged!\" said Mr. Boythorn. \"Had no need to ask, after even my\\nslight experience of Miss Summerson\\'s forethought for every one about\\nher.\" (They all encouraged me; they were determined to do it.) \"I\\ninquired because, coming from Lincolnshire, I of course have not yet\\nbeen in town, and I thought some letters might have been sent down\\nhere. I dare say they will report progress to-morrow morning.\"\\n\\nI saw him so often in the course of the evening, which passed very\\npleasantly, contemplate Richard and Ada with an interest and a\\nsatisfaction that made his fine face remarkably agreeable as he sat\\nat a little distance from the piano listening to the music--and he\\nhad small occasion to tell us that he was passionately fond of music,\\nfor his face showed it--that I asked my guardian as we sat at the\\nbackgammon board whether Mr. Boythorn had ever been married.\\n\\n\"No,\" said he. \"No.\"\\n\\n\"But he meant to be!\" said I.\\n\\n\"How did you find out that?\" he returned with a smile. \"Why,\\nguardian,\" I explained, not without reddening a little at hazarding\\nwhat was in my thoughts, \"there is something so tender in his manner,\\nafter all, and he is so very courtly and gentle to us, and--\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce directed his eyes to where he was sitting as I have just\\ndescribed him.\\n\\nI said no more.\\n\\n\"You are right, little woman,\" he answered. \"He was all but married\\nonce. Long ago. And once.\"\\n\\n\"Did the lady die?\"\\n\\n\"No--but she died to him. That time has had its influence on all his\\nlater life. Would you suppose him to have a head and a heart full of\\nromance yet?\"\\n\\n\"I think, guardian, I might have supposed so. But it is easy to say\\nthat when you have told me so.\"\\n\\n\"He has never since been what he might have been,\" said Mr. Jarndyce,\\n\"and now you see him in his age with no one near him but his servant\\nand his little yellow friend. It\\'s your throw, my dear!\"\\n\\nI felt, from my guardian\\'s manner, that beyond this point I could not\\npursue the subject without changing the wind. I therefore forbore to\\nask any further questions. I was interested, but not curious. I\\nthought a little while about this old love story in the night, when I\\nwas awakened by Mr. Boythorn\\'s lusty snoring; and I tried to do that\\nvery difficult thing, imagine old people young again and invested\\nwith the graces of youth. But I fell asleep before I had succeeded,\\nand dreamed of the days when I lived in my godmother\\'s house. I am\\nnot sufficiently acquainted with such subjects to know whether it is\\nat all remarkable that I almost always dreamed of that period of my\\nlife.\\n\\nWith the morning there came a letter from Messrs. Kenge and Carboy to\\nMr. Boythorn informing him that one of their clerks would wait upon\\nhim at noon. As it was the day of the week on which I paid the bills,\\nand added up my books, and made all the household affairs as compact\\nas possible, I remained at home while Mr. Jarndyce, Ada, and Richard\\ntook advantage of a very fine day to make a little excursion, Mr.\\nBoythorn was to wait for Kenge and Carboy\\'s clerk and then was to go\\non foot to meet them on their return.\\n\\nWell! I was full of business, examining tradesmen\\'s books, adding up\\ncolumns, paying money, filing receipts, and I dare say making a great\\nbustle about it when Mr. Guppy was announced and shown in. I had had\\nsome idea that the clerk who was to be sent down might be the young\\ngentleman who had met me at the coach-office, and I was glad to see\\nhim, because he was associated with my present happiness.\\n\\nI scarcely knew him again, he was so uncommonly smart. He had an\\nentirely new suit of glossy clothes on, a shining hat, lilac-kid\\ngloves, a neckerchief of a variety of colours, a large hot-house\\nflower in his button-hole, and a thick gold ring on his little\\nfinger. Besides which, he quite scented the dining-room with\\nbear\\'s-grease and other perfumery. He looked at me with an attention\\nthat quite confused me when I begged him to take a seat until the\\nservant should return; and as he sat there crossing and uncrossing\\nhis legs in a corner, and I asked him if he had had a pleasant ride,\\nand hoped that Mr. Kenge was well, I never looked at him, but I found\\nhim looking at me in the same scrutinizing and curious way.\\n\\nWhen the request was brought to him that he would go upstairs to Mr.\\nBoythorn\\'s room, I mentioned that he would find lunch prepared for\\nhim when he came down, of which Mr. Jarndyce hoped he would partake.\\nHe said with some embarrassment, holding the handle of the door,\\n\"Shall I have the honour of finding you here, miss?\" I replied yes, I\\nshould be there; and he went out with a bow and another look.\\n\\nI thought him only awkward and shy, for he was evidently much\\nembarrassed; and I fancied that the best thing I could do would be to\\nwait until I saw that he had everything he wanted and then to leave\\nhim to himself. The lunch was soon brought, but it remained for some\\ntime on the table. The interview with Mr. Boythorn was a long one,\\nand a stormy one too, I should think, for although his room was at\\nsome distance I heard his loud voice rising every now and then like a\\nhigh wind, and evidently blowing perfect broadsides of denunciation.\\n\\nAt last Mr. Guppy came back, looking something the worse for the\\nconference. \"My eye, miss,\" he said in a low voice, \"he\\'s a Tartar!\"\\n\\n\"Pray take some refreshment, sir,\" said I.\\n\\nMr. Guppy sat down at the table and began nervously sharpening the\\ncarving-knife on the carving-fork, still looking at me (as I felt\\nquite sure without looking at him) in the same unusual manner. The\\nsharpening lasted so long that at last I felt a kind of obligation on\\nme to raise my eyes in order that I might break the spell under which\\nhe seemed to labour, of not being able to leave off.\\n\\nHe immediately looked at the dish and began to carve.\\n\\n\"What will you take yourself, miss? You\\'ll take a morsel of\\nsomething?\"\\n\\n\"No, thank you,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Shan\\'t I give you a piece of anything at all, miss?\" said Mr. Guppy,\\nhurriedly drinking off a glass of wine.\\n\\n\"Nothing, thank you,\" said I. \"I have only waited to see that you\\nhave everything you want. Is there anything I can order for you?\"\\n\\n\"No, I am much obliged to you, miss, I\\'m sure. I\\'ve everything that I\\ncan require to make me comfortable--at least I--not comfortable--I\\'m\\nnever that.\" He drank off two more glasses of wine, one after\\nanother.\\n\\nI thought I had better go.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, miss!\" said Mr. Guppy, rising when he saw me\\nrise. \"But would you allow me the favour of a minute\\'s private\\nconversation?\"\\n\\nNot knowing what to say, I sat down again.\\n\\n\"What follows is without prejudice, miss?\" said Mr. Guppy, anxiously\\nbringing a chair towards my table.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand what you mean,\" said I, wondering.\\n\\n\"It\\'s one of our law terms, miss. You won\\'t make any use of it to my\\ndetriment at Kenge and Carboy\\'s or elsewhere. If our conversation\\nshouldn\\'t lead to anything, I am to be as I was and am not to be\\nprejudiced in my situation or worldly prospects. In short, it\\'s in\\ntotal confidence.\"\\n\\n\"I am at a loss, sir,\" said I, \"to imagine what you can have to\\ncommunicate in total confidence to me, whom you have never seen but\\nonce; but I should be very sorry to do you any injury.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, miss. I\\'m sure of it--that\\'s quite sufficient.\" All this\\ntime Mr. Guppy was either planing his forehead with his handkerchief\\nor tightly rubbing the palm of his left hand with the palm of his\\nright. \"If you would excuse my taking another glass of wine, miss, I\\nthink it might assist me in getting on without a continual choke that\\ncannot fail to be mutually unpleasant.\"\\n\\nHe did so, and came back again. I took the opportunity of moving well\\nbehind my table.\\n\\n\"You wouldn\\'t allow me to offer you one, would you miss?\" said Mr.\\nGuppy, apparently refreshed.\\n\\n\"Not any,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Not half a glass?\" said Mr. Guppy. \"Quarter? No! Then, to proceed.\\nMy present salary, Miss Summerson, at Kenge and Carboy\\'s, is two\\npound a week. When I first had the happiness of looking upon you, it\\nwas one fifteen, and had stood at that figure for a lengthened\\nperiod. A rise of five has since taken place, and a further rise of\\nfive is guaranteed at the expiration of a term not exceeding twelve\\nmonths from the present date. My mother has a little property, which\\ntakes the form of a small life annuity, upon which she lives in an\\nindependent though unassuming manner in the Old Street Road. She is\\neminently calculated for a mother-in-law. She never interferes, is\\nall for peace, and her disposition easy. She has her failings--as who\\nhas not?--but I never knew her do it when company was present, at\\nwhich time you may freely trust her with wines, spirits, or malt\\nliquors. My own abode is lodgings at Penton Place, Pentonville. It is\\nlowly, but airy, open at the back, and considered one of the\\n\\'ealthiest outlets. Miss Summerson! In the mildest language, I adore\\nyou. Would you be so kind as to allow me (as I may say) to file a\\ndeclaration--to make an offer!\"\\n\\nMr. Guppy went down on his knees. I was well behind my table and not\\nmuch frightened. I said, \"Get up from that ridiculous position\\nimmediately, sir, or you will oblige me to break my implied promise\\nand ring the bell!\"\\n\\n\"Hear me out, miss!\" said Mr. Guppy, folding his hands.\\n\\n\"I cannot consent to hear another word, sir,\" I returned, \"Unless you\\nget up from the carpet directly and go and sit down at the table as\\nyou ought to do if you have any sense at all.\"\\n\\nHe looked piteously, but slowly rose and did so.\\n\\n\"Yet what a mockery it is, miss,\" he said with his hand upon his\\nheart and shaking his head at me in a melancholy manner over the\\ntray, \"to be stationed behind food at such a moment. The soul recoils\\nfrom food at such a moment, miss.\"\\n\\n\"I beg you to conclude,\" said I; \"you have asked me to hear you out,\\nand I beg you to conclude.\"\\n\\n\"I will, miss,\" said Mr. Guppy. \"As I love and honour, so likewise I\\nobey. Would that I could make thee the subject of that vow before the\\nshrine!\"\\n\\n\"That is quite impossible,\" said I, \"and entirely out of the\\nquestion.\"\\n\\n\"I am aware,\" said Mr. Guppy, leaning forward over the tray and\\nregarding me, as I again strangely felt, though my eyes were not\\ndirected to him, with his late intent look, \"I am aware that in a\\nworldly point of view, according to all appearances, my offer is a\\npoor one. But, Miss Summerson! Angel! No, don\\'t ring--I have been\\nbrought up in a sharp school and am accustomed to a variety of\\ngeneral practice. Though a young man, I have ferreted out evidence,\\ngot up cases, and seen lots of life. Blest with your hand, what means\\nmight I not find of advancing your interests and pushing your\\nfortunes! What might I not get to know, nearly concerning you? I know\\nnothing now, certainly; but what MIGHT I not if I had your\\nconfidence, and you set me on?\"\\n\\nI told him that he addressed my interest or what he supposed to be my\\ninterest quite as unsuccessfully as he addressed my inclination, and\\nhe would now understand that I requested him, if he pleased, to go\\naway immediately.\\n\\n\"Cruel miss,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"hear but another word! I think you\\nmust have seen that I was struck with those charms on the day when I\\nwaited at the Whytorseller. I think you must have remarked that I\\ncould not forbear a tribute to those charms when I put up the steps\\nof the \\'ackney-coach. It was a feeble tribute to thee, but it was\\nwell meant. Thy image has ever since been fixed in my breast. I have\\nwalked up and down of an evening opposite Jellyby\\'s house only to\\nlook upon the bricks that once contained thee. This out of to-day,\\nquite an unnecessary out so far as the attendance, which was its\\npretended object, went, was planned by me alone for thee alone. If I\\nspeak of interest, it is only to recommend myself and my respectful\\nwretchedness. Love was before it, and is before it.\"\\n\\n\"I should be pained, Mr. Guppy,\" said I, rising and putting my hand\\nupon the bell-rope, \"to do you or any one who was sincere the\\ninjustice of slighting any honest feeling, however disagreeably\\nexpressed. If you have really meant to give me a proof of your good\\nopinion, though ill-timed and misplaced, I feel that I ought to thank\\nyou. I have very little reason to be proud, and I am not proud. I\\nhope,\" I think I added, without very well knowing what I said, \"that\\nyou will now go away as if you had never been so exceedingly foolish\\nand attend to Messrs. Kenge and Carboy\\'s business.\"\\n\\n\"Half a minute, miss!\" cried Mr. Guppy, checking me as I was about to\\nring. \"This has been without prejudice?\"\\n\\n\"I will never mention it,\" said I, \"unless you should give me future\\noccasion to do so.\"\\n\\n\"A quarter of a minute, miss! In case you should think better at any\\ntime, however distant--THAT\\'S no consequence, for my feelings can\\nnever alter--of anything I have said, particularly what might I not\\ndo, Mr. William Guppy, eighty-seven, Penton Place, or if removed, or\\ndead (of blighted hopes or anything of that sort), care of Mrs.\\nGuppy, three hundred and two, Old Street Road, will be sufficient.\"\\n\\nI rang the bell, the servant came, and Mr. Guppy, laying his written\\ncard upon the table and making a dejected bow, departed. Raising my\\neyes as he went out, I once more saw him looking at me after he had\\npassed the door.\\n\\nI sat there for another hour or more, finishing my books and payments\\nand getting through plenty of business. Then I arranged my desk, and\\nput everything away, and was so composed and cheerful that I thought\\nI had quite dismissed this unexpected incident. But, when I went\\nupstairs to my own room, I surprised myself by beginning to laugh\\nabout it and then surprised myself still more by beginning to cry\\nabout it. In short, I was in a flutter for a little while and felt as\\nif an old chord had been more coarsely touched than it ever had been\\nsince the days of the dear old doll, long buried in the garden.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the eastern borders of Chancery Lane, that is to say, more\\nparticularly in Cook\\'s Court, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby,\\nlaw-stationer, pursues his lawful calling. In the shade of Cook\\'s\\nCourt, at most times a shady place, Mr. Snagsby has dealt in\\nall sorts of blank forms of legal process; in skins and rolls\\nof parchment; in paper--foolscap, brief, draft, brown, white,\\nwhitey-brown, and blotting; in stamps; in office-quills, pens,\\nink, India-rubber, pounce, pins, pencils, sealing-wax, and\\nwafers; in red tape and green ferret; in pocket-books, almanacs,\\ndiaries, and law lists; in string boxes, rulers, inkstands--glass\\nand leaden--pen-knives, scissors, bodkins, and other small\\noffice-cutlery; in short, in articles too numerous to mention, ever\\nsince he was out of his time and went into partnership with Peffer.\\nOn that occasion, Cook\\'s Court was in a manner revolutionized by the\\nnew inscription in fresh paint, PEFFER AND SNAGSBY, displacing the\\ntime-honoured and not easily to be deciphered legend PEFFER only. For\\nsmoke, which is the London ivy, had so wreathed itself round Peffer\\'s\\nname and clung to his dwelling-place that the affectionate parasite\\nquite overpowered the parent tree.\\n\\nPeffer is never seen in Cook\\'s Court now. He is not expected there,\\nfor he has been recumbent this quarter of a century in the churchyard\\nof St. Andrews, Holborn, with the waggons and hackney-coaches roaring\\npast him all the day and half the night like one great dragon. If he\\never steal forth when the dragon is at rest to air himself again in\\nCook\\'s Court until admonished to return by the crowing of the\\nsanguine cock in the cellar at the little dairy in Cursitor Street,\\nwhose ideas of daylight it would be curious to ascertain, since he\\nknows from his personal observation next to nothing about it--if\\nPeffer ever do revisit the pale glimpses of Cook\\'s Court, which no\\nlaw-stationer in the trade can positively deny, he comes invisibly,\\nand no one is the worse or wiser.\\n\\nIn his lifetime, and likewise in the period of Snagsby\\'s \"time\"\\nof seven long years, there dwelt with Peffer in the same\\nlaw-stationering premises a niece--a short, shrewd niece, something\\ntoo violently compressed about the waist, and with a sharp nose like\\na sharp autumn evening, inclining to be frosty towards the end. The\\nCook\\'s Courtiers had a rumour flying among them that the mother of\\nthis niece did, in her daughter\\'s childhood, moved by too jealous a\\nsolicitude that her figure should approach perfection, lace her\\nup every morning with her maternal foot against the bed-post for\\na stronger hold and purchase; and further, that she exhibited\\ninternally pints of vinegar and lemon-juice, which acids, they held,\\nhad mounted to the nose and temper of the patient. With whichsoever\\nof the many tongues of Rumour this frothy report originated, it\\neither never reached or never influenced the ears of young Snagsby,\\nwho, having wooed and won its fair subject on his arrival at man\\'s\\nestate, entered into two partnerships at once. So now, in Cook\\'s\\nCourt, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby and the niece are one; and the\\nniece still cherishes her figure, which, however tastes may differ,\\nis unquestionably so far precious that there is mighty little of it.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Snagsby are not only one bone and one flesh, but, to the\\nneighbours\\' thinking, one voice too. That voice, appearing to proceed\\nfrom Mrs. Snagsby alone, is heard in Cook\\'s Court very often. Mr.\\nSnagsby, otherwise than as he finds expression through these dulcet\\ntones, is rarely heard. He is a mild, bald, timid man with a shining\\nhead and a scrubby clump of black hair sticking out at the back. He\\ntends to meekness and obesity. As he stands at his door in Cook\\'s\\nCourt in his grey shop-coat and black calico sleeves, looking up at\\nthe clouds, or stands behind a desk in his dark shop with a heavy\\nflat ruler, snipping and slicing at sheepskin in company with his two\\n\\'prentices, he is emphatically a retiring and unassuming man. From\\nbeneath his feet, at such times, as from a shrill ghost unquiet in\\nits grave, there frequently arise complainings and lamentations in\\nthe voice already mentioned; and haply, on some occasions when these\\nreach a sharper pitch than usual, Mr. Snagsby mentions to the\\n\\'prentices, \"I think my little woman is a-giving it to Guster!\"\\n\\nThis proper name, so used by Mr. Snagsby, has before now sharpened\\nthe wit of the Cook\\'s Courtiers to remark that it ought to be the\\nname of Mrs. Snagsby, seeing that she might with great force and\\nexpression be termed a Guster, in compliment to her stormy character.\\nIt is, however, the possession, and the only possession except fifty\\nshillings per annum and a very small box indifferently filled with\\nclothing, of a lean young woman from a workhouse (by some supposed to\\nhave been christened Augusta) who, although she was farmed or\\ncontracted for during her growing time by an amiable benefactor of\\nhis species resident at Tooting, and cannot fail to have been\\ndeveloped under the most favourable circumstances, \"has fits,\" which\\nthe parish can\\'t account for.\\n\\nGuster, really aged three or four and twenty, but looking a round ten\\nyears older, goes cheap with this unaccountable drawback of fits, and\\nis so apprehensive of being returned on the hands of her patron saint\\nthat except when she is found with her head in the pail, or the sink,\\nor the copper, or the dinner, or anything else that happens to be\\nnear her at the time of her seizure, she is always at work. She is a\\nsatisfaction to the parents and guardians of the \\'prentices, who feel\\nthat there is little danger of her inspiring tender emotions in the\\nbreast of youth; she is a satisfaction to Mrs. Snagsby, who can\\nalways find fault with her; she is a satisfaction to Mr. Snagsby, who\\nthinks it a charity to keep her. The law-stationer\\'s establishment\\nis, in Guster\\'s eyes, a temple of plenty and splendour. She believes\\nthe little drawing-room upstairs, always kept, as one may say, with\\nits hair in papers and its pinafore on, to be the most elegant\\napartment in Christendom. The view it commands of Cook\\'s Court at one\\nend (not to mention a squint into Cursitor Street) and of Coavinses\\'\\nthe sheriff\\'s officer\\'s backyard at the other she regards as a\\nprospect of unequalled beauty. The portraits it displays in oil--and\\nplenty of it too--of Mr. Snagsby looking at Mrs. Snagsby and of Mrs.\\nSnagsby looking at Mr. Snagsby are in her eyes as achievements of\\nRaphael or Titian. Guster has some recompenses for her many\\nprivations.\\n\\nMr. Snagsby refers everything not in the practical mysteries of the\\nbusiness to Mrs. Snagsby. She manages the money, reproaches the\\ntax-gatherers, appoints the times and places of devotion on Sundays,\\nlicenses Mr. Snagsby\\'s entertainments, and acknowledges no\\nresponsibility as to what she thinks fit to provide for dinner,\\ninsomuch that she is the high standard of comparison among the\\nneighbouring wives a long way down Chancery Lane on both sides, and\\neven out in Holborn, who in any domestic passages of arms habitually\\ncall upon their husbands to look at the difference between their (the\\nwives\\') position and Mrs. Snagsby\\'s, and their (the husbands\\')\\nbehaviour and Mr. Snagsby\\'s. Rumour, always flying bat-like about\\nCook\\'s Court and skimming in and out at everybody\\'s windows, does say\\nthat Mrs. Snagsby is jealous and inquisitive and that Mr. Snagsby is\\nsometimes worried out of house and home, and that if he had the\\nspirit of a mouse he wouldn\\'t stand it. It is even observed that the\\nwives who quote him to their self-willed husbands as a shining\\nexample in reality look down upon him and that nobody does so with\\ngreater superciliousness than one particular lady whose lord is more\\nthan suspected of laying his umbrella on her as an instrument of\\ncorrection. But these vague whisperings may arise from Mr. Snagsby\\'s\\nbeing in his way rather a meditative and poetical man, loving to walk\\nin Staple Inn in the summer-time and to observe how countrified the\\nsparrows and the leaves are, also to lounge about the Rolls Yard of a\\nSunday afternoon and to remark (if in good spirits) that there were\\nold times once and that you\\'d find a stone coffin or two now under\\nthat chapel, he\\'ll be bound, if you was to dig for it. He solaces his\\nimagination, too, by thinking of the many Chancellors and Vices, and\\nMasters of the Rolls who are deceased; and he gets such a flavour of\\nthe country out of telling the two \\'prentices how he HAS heard say\\nthat a brook \"as clear as crystal\" once ran right down the middle of\\nHolborn, when Turnstile really was a turnstile, leading slap away\\ninto the meadows--gets such a flavour of the country out of this that\\nhe never wants to go there.\\n\\nThe day is closing in and the gas is lighted, but is not yet fully\\neffective, for it is not quite dark. Mr. Snagsby standing at his\\nshop-door looking up at the clouds sees a crow who is out late skim\\nwestward over the slice of sky belonging to Cook\\'s Court. The crow\\nflies straight across Chancery Lane and Lincoln\\'s Inn Garden into\\nLincoln\\'s Inn Fields.\\n\\nHere, in a large house, formerly a house of state, lives Mr.\\nTulkinghorn. It is let off in sets of chambers now, and in those\\nshrunken fragments of its greatness, lawyers lie like maggots in\\nnuts. But its roomy staircases, passages, and antechambers still\\nremain; and even its painted ceilings, where Allegory, in Roman\\nhelmet and celestial linen, sprawls among balustrades and pillars,\\nflowers, clouds, and big-legged boys, and makes the head ache--as\\nwould seem to be Allegory\\'s object always, more or less. Here, among\\nhis many boxes labelled with transcendent names, lives Mr.\\nTulkinghorn, when not speechlessly at home in country-houses where\\nthe great ones of the earth are bored to death. Here he is to-day,\\nquiet at his table. An oyster of the old school whom nobody can open.\\n\\nLike as he is to look at, so is his apartment in the dusk of\\nthe present afternoon. Rusty, out of date, withdrawing from\\nattention, able to afford it. Heavy, broad-backed, old-fashioned,\\nmahogany-and-horsehair chairs, not easily lifted; obsolete tables\\nwith spindle-legs and dusty baize covers; presentation prints of the\\nholders of great titles in the last generation or the last but one,\\nenviron him. A thick and dingy Turkey-carpet muffles the floor where\\nhe sits, attended by two candles in old-fashioned silver candlesticks\\nthat give a very insufficient light to his large room. The titles on\\nthe backs of his books have retired into the binding; everything that\\ncan have a lock has got one; no key is visible. Very few loose papers\\nare about. He has some manuscript near him, but is not referring\\nto it. With the round top of an inkstand and two broken bits of\\nsealing-wax he is silently and slowly working out whatever train of\\nindecision is in his mind. Now the inkstand top is in the middle, now\\nthe red bit of sealing-wax, now the black bit. That\\'s not it. Mr.\\nTulkinghorn must gather them all up and begin again.\\n\\nHere, beneath the painted ceiling, with foreshortened Allegory\\nstaring down at his intrusion as if it meant to swoop upon him, and\\nhe cutting it dead, Mr. Tulkinghorn has at once his house and office.\\nHe keeps no staff, only one middle-aged man, usually a little out at\\nelbows, who sits in a high pew in the hall and is rarely overburdened\\nwith business. Mr. Tulkinghorn is not in a common way. He wants no\\nclerks. He is a great reservoir of confidences, not to be so tapped.\\nHis clients want HIM; he is all in all. Drafts that he requires to be\\ndrawn are drawn by special-pleaders in the temple on mysterious\\ninstructions; fair copies that he requires to be made are made at the\\nstationers\\', expense being no consideration. The middle-aged man in\\nthe pew knows scarcely more of the affairs of the peerage than any\\ncrossing-sweeper in Holborn.\\n\\nThe red bit, the black bit, the inkstand top, the other inkstand top,\\nthe little sand-box. So! You to the middle, you to the right, you to\\nthe left. This train of indecision must surely be worked out now or\\nnever. Now! Mr. Tulkinghorn gets up, adjusts his spectacles, puts on\\nhis hat, puts the manuscript in his pocket, goes out, tells the\\nmiddle-aged man out at elbows, \"I shall be back presently.\" Very\\nrarely tells him anything more explicit.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn goes, as the crow came--not quite so straight, but\\nnearly--to Cook\\'s Court, Cursitor Street. To Snagsby\\'s,\\nLaw-Stationer\\'s, Deeds engrossed and copied, Law-Writing executed in\\nall its branches, &c., &c., &c.\\n\\nIt is somewhere about five or six o\\'clock in the afternoon, and a\\nbalmy fragrance of warm tea hovers in Cook\\'s Court. It hovers about\\nSnagsby\\'s door. The hours are early there: dinner at half-past one\\nand supper at half-past nine. Mr. Snagsby was about to descend into\\nthe subterranean regions to take tea when he looked out of his door\\njust now and saw the crow who was out late.\\n\\n\"Master at home?\"\\n\\nGuster is minding the shop, for the \\'prentices take tea in the\\nkitchen with Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby; consequently, the robe-maker\\'s two\\ndaughters, combing their curls at the two glasses in the two\\nsecond-floor windows of the opposite house, are not driving the two\\n\\'prentices to distraction as they fondly suppose, but are merely\\nawakening the unprofitable admiration of Guster, whose hair won\\'t\\ngrow, and never would, and it is confidently thought, never will.\\n\\n\"Master at home?\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\nMaster is at home, and Guster will fetch him. Guster disappears, glad\\nto get out of the shop, which she regards with mingled dread and\\nveneration as a storehouse of awful implements of the great torture\\nof the law--a place not to be entered after the gas is turned off.\\n\\nMr. Snagsby appears, greasy, warm, herbaceous, and chewing. Bolts a\\nbit of bread and butter. Says, \"Bless my soul, sir! Mr. Tulkinghorn!\"\\n\\n\"I want half a word with you, Snagsby.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, sir! Dear me, sir, why didn\\'t you send your young man\\nround for me? Pray walk into the back shop, sir.\" Snagsby has\\nbrightened in a moment.\\n\\nThe confined room, strong of parchment-grease, is warehouse,\\ncounting-house, and copying-office. Mr. Tulkinghorn sits, facing\\nround, on a stool at the desk.\\n\\n\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Snagsby.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\" Mr. Snagsby turns up the gas and coughs behind his hand,\\nmodestly anticipating profit. Mr. Snagsby, as a timid man, is\\naccustomed to cough with a variety of expressions, and so to save\\nwords.\\n\\n\"You copied some affidavits in that cause for me lately.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, we did.\"\\n\\n\"There was one of them,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, carelessly\\nfeeling--tight, unopenable oyster of the old school!--in the wrong\\ncoat-pocket, \"the handwriting of which is peculiar, and I rather\\nlike. As I happened to be passing, and thought I had it about me, I\\nlooked in to ask you--but I haven\\'t got it. No matter, any other time\\nwill do. Ah! here it is! I looked in to ask you who copied this.\"\\n\\n\"Who copied this, sir?\" says Mr. Snagsby, taking it, laying it flat\\non the desk, and separating all the sheets at once with a twirl and a\\ntwist of the left hand peculiar to lawstationers. \"We gave this out,\\nsir. We were giving out rather a large quantity of work just at that\\ntime. I can tell you in a moment who copied it, sir, by referring to\\nmy book.\"\\n\\nMr. Snagsby takes his book down from the safe, makes another bolt of\\nthe bit of bread and butter which seemed to have stopped short, eyes\\nthe affidavit aside, and brings his right forefinger travelling down\\na page of the book, \"Jewby--Packer--Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Jarndyce! Here we are, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby. \"To be sure! I might\\nhave remembered it. This was given out, sir, to a writer who lodges\\njust over on the opposite side of the lane.\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn has seen the entry, found it before the\\nlaw-stationer, read it while the forefinger was coming down the hill.\\n\\n\"WHAT do you call him? Nemo?\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"Nemo, sir. Here\\nit is. Forty-two folio. Given out on the Wednesday night at eight\\no\\'clock, brought in on the Thursday morning at half after nine.\"\\n\\n\"Nemo!\" repeats Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"Nemo is Latin for no one.\"\\n\\n\"It must be English for some one, sir, I think,\" Mr. Snagsby submits\\nwith his deferential cough. \"It is a person\\'s name. Here it is, you\\nsee, sir! Forty-two folio. Given out Wednesday night, eight o\\'clock;\\nbrought in Thursday morning, half after nine.\"\\n\\nThe tail of Mr. Snagsby\\'s eye becomes conscious of the head of Mrs.\\nSnagsby looking in at the shop-door to know what he means by\\ndeserting his tea. Mr. Snagsby addresses an explanatory cough to Mrs.\\nSnagsby, as who should say, \"My dear, a customer!\"\\n\\n\"Half after nine, sir,\" repeats Mr. Snagsby. \"Our law-writers, who\\nlive by job-work, are a queer lot; and this may not be his name, but\\nit\\'s the name he goes by. I remember now, sir, that he gives it in a\\nwritten advertisement he sticks up down at the Rule Office, and the\\nKing\\'s Bench Office, and the Judges\\' Chambers, and so forth. You know\\nthe kind of document, sir--wanting employ?\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn glances through the little window at the back of\\nCoavinses\\', the sheriff\\'s officer\\'s, where lights shine in Coavinses\\'\\nwindows. Coavinses\\' coffee-room is at the back, and the shadows of\\nseveral gentlemen under a cloud loom cloudily upon the blinds. Mr.\\nSnagsby takes the opportunity of slightly turning his head to glance\\nover his shoulder at his little woman and to make apologetic motions\\nwith his mouth to this effect: \"Tul-king-horn--rich--in-flu-en-tial!\"\\n\\n\"Have you given this man work before?\" asks Mr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, yes, sir! Work of yours.\"\\n\\n\"Thinking of more important matters, I forget where you said he\\nlived?\"\\n\\n\"Across the lane, sir. In fact, he lodges at a--\" Mr. Snagsby makes\\nanother bolt, as if the bit of bread and butter were insurmountable\\n\"--at a rag and bottle shop.\"\\n\\n\"Can you show me the place as I go back?\"\\n\\n\"With the greatest pleasure, sir!\"\\n\\nMr. Snagsby pulls off his sleeves and his grey coat, pulls on his\\nblack coat, takes his hat from its peg. \"Oh! Here is my little\\nwoman!\" he says aloud. \"My dear, will you be so kind as to tell one\\nof the lads to look after the shop while I step across the lane with\\nMr. Tulkinghorn? Mrs. Snagsby, sir--I shan\\'t be two minutes, my\\nlove!\"\\n\\nMrs. Snagsby bends to the lawyer, retires behind the counter, peeps\\nat them through the window-blind, goes softly into the back office,\\nrefers to the entries in the book still lying open. Is evidently\\ncurious.\\n\\n\"You will find that the place is rough, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby,\\nwalking deferentially in the road and leaving the narrow pavement to\\nthe lawyer; \"and the party is very rough. But they\\'re a wild lot in\\ngeneral, sir. The advantage of this particular man is that he never\\nwants sleep. He\\'ll go at it right on end if you want him to, as long\\nas ever you like.\"\\n\\nIt is quite dark now, and the gas-lamps have acquired their full\\neffect. Jostling against clerks going to post the day\\'s letters, and\\nagainst counsel and attorneys going home to dinner, and against\\nplaintiffs and defendants and suitors of all sorts, and against the\\ngeneral crowd, in whose way the forensic wisdom of ages has\\ninterposed a million of obstacles to the transaction of the commonest\\nbusiness of life; diving through law and equity, and through that\\nkindred mystery, the street mud, which is made of nobody knows what\\nand collects about us nobody knows whence or how--we only knowing in\\ngeneral that when there is too much of it we find it necessary to\\nshovel it away--the lawyer and the law-stationer come to a rag and\\nbottle shop and general emporium of much disregarded merchandise,\\nlying and being in the shadow of the wall of Lincoln\\'s Inn, and kept,\\nas is announced in paint, to all whom it may concern, by one Krook.\\n\\n\"This is where he lives, sir,\" says the law-stationer.\\n\\n\"This is where he lives, is it?\" says the lawyer unconcernedly.\\n\"Thank you.\"\\n\\n\"Are you not going in, sir?\"\\n\\n\"No, thank you, no; I am going on to the Fields at present. Good\\nevening. Thank you!\" Mr. Snagsby lifts his hat and returns to his\\nlittle woman and his tea.\\n\\nBut Mr. Tulkinghorn does not go on to the Fields at present. He goes\\na short way, turns back, comes again to the shop of Mr. Krook, and\\nenters it straight. It is dim enough, with a blot-headed candle or so\\nin the windows, and an old man and a cat sitting in the back part by\\na fire. The old man rises and comes forward, with another blot-headed\\ncandle in his hand.\\n\\n\"Pray is your lodger within?\"\\n\\n\"Male or female, sir?\" says Mr. Krook.\\n\\n\"Male. The person who does copying.\"\\n\\nMr. Krook has eyed his man narrowly. Knows him by sight. Has an\\nindistinct impression of his aristocratic repute.\\n\\n\"Did you wish to see him, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s what I seldom do myself,\" says Mr. Krook with a grin. \"Shall I\\ncall him down? But it\\'s a weak chance if he\\'d come, sir!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go up to him, then,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"Second floor, sir. Take the candle. Up there!\" Mr. Krook, with his\\ncat beside him, stands at the bottom of the staircase, looking after\\nMr. Tulkinghorn. \"Hi-hi!\" he says when Mr. Tulkinghorn has nearly\\ndisappeared. The lawyer looks down over the hand-rail. The cat\\nexpands her wicked mouth and snarls at him.\\n\\n\"Order, Lady Jane! Behave yourself to visitors, my lady! You know\\nwhat they say of my lodger?\" whispers Krook, going up a step or two.\\n\\n\"What do they say of him?\"\\n\\n\"They say he has sold himself to the enemy, but you and I know\\nbetter--he don\\'t buy. I\\'ll tell you what, though; my lodger is so\\nblack-humoured and gloomy that I believe he\\'d as soon make that\\nbargain as any other. Don\\'t put him out, sir. That\\'s my advice!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn with a nod goes on his way. He comes to the dark door\\non the second floor. He knocks, receives no answer, opens it, and\\naccidentally extinguishes his candle in doing so.\\n\\nThe air of the room is almost bad enough to have extinguished it if\\nhe had not. It is a small room, nearly black with soot, and grease,\\nand dirt. In the rusty skeleton of a grate, pinched at the middle as\\nif poverty had gripped it, a red coke fire burns low. In the corner\\nby the chimney stand a deal table and a broken desk, a wilderness\\nmarked with a rain of ink. In another corner a ragged old portmanteau\\non one of the two chairs serves for cabinet or wardrobe; no larger\\none is needed, for it collapses like the cheeks of a starved man. The\\nfloor is bare, except that one old mat, trodden to shreds of\\nrope-yarn, lies perishing upon the hearth. No curtain veils the\\ndarkness of the night, but the discoloured shutters are drawn\\ntogether, and through the two gaunt holes pierced in them, famine\\nmight be staring in--the banshee of the man upon the bed.\\n\\nFor, on a low bed opposite the fire, a confusion of dirty patchwork,\\nlean-ribbed ticking, and coarse sacking, the lawyer, hesitating just\\nwithin the doorway, sees a man. He lies there, dressed in shirt and\\ntrousers, with bare feet. He has a yellow look in the spectral\\ndarkness of a candle that has guttered down until the whole length of\\nits wick (still burning) has doubled over and left a tower of\\nwinding-sheet above it. His hair is ragged, mingling with his\\nwhiskers and his beard--the latter, ragged too, and grown, like the\\nscum and mist around him, in neglect. Foul and filthy as the room is,\\nfoul and filthy as the air is, it is not easy to perceive what fumes\\nthose are which most oppress the senses in it; but through the\\ngeneral sickliness and faintness, and the odour of stale tobacco,\\nthere comes into the lawyer\\'s mouth the bitter, vapid taste of opium.\\n\\n\"Hallo, my friend!\" he cries, and strikes his iron candlestick\\nagainst the door.\\n\\nHe thinks he has awakened his friend. He lies a little turned away,\\nbut his eyes are surely open.\\n\\n\"Hallo, my friend!\" he cries again. \"Hallo! Hallo!\"\\n\\nAs he rattles on the door, the candle which has drooped so long goes\\nout and leaves him in the dark, with the gaunt eyes in the shutters\\nstaring down upon the bed.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'model_output': 'Esther wakes before dawn in early to mid 19th century England and watches the gradual reveal of the landscape outside her window at the house where she lives with her guardian Mr. Jarndyce and her friend Ada, taking pleasure in discovering its details. She busies herself taking inventory of the house\\'s pantries, cellars, and store-rooms, making notes about the food supplies. When the breakfast bell rings, Esther hurries to make tea, and since the others haven\\'t come down yet, she takes a walk in the garden. She finds the house very well-kept and the garden delightful. Beyond them are a farm yard and fields. Esther sees her dear friend Ada at an upstairs window. At breakfast Mr. Skimpole, a friend of Mr. Jarndyce, likens himself to a drone bee, claiming he cannot be expected to actively attend to responsibilities.\\n\\nEsther returns to her duties around the house. Mr. Jarndyce calls her into his \"growlery\" where he goes when out of humor. Esther becomes emotional, kissing his hand. He gently reassures her this show of affection is alright and explains the complex Chancery case about a disputed will related to the Jarndyce family that has dragged on endlessly, consuming the estate with costs. Esther admits she doesn\\'t understand the Chancery business. Mr. Jarndyce says hardly anyone does, as it has become solely about costs. \\n\\nLater, Mrs. Pardiggle visits with her five unhappy, discontented sons, forcing them into charity work. She criticizes Mrs. Jellyby\\'s parenting and invites Ada and Esther to visit a brickmaker with her. On the way, her son Egbert demands money from Esther and pinches her when she refuses. At the brickmaker\\'s, Mrs. Pardiggle\\'s loud, ill-suited efforts seem unwanted. The family largely ignores her. The man complains when she\\'s done. A baby dies while they are there. Ada comforts the mourning mother while Esther makes the baby look peaceful. They leave to avoid interrupting the mourners and later return with comforts, though the man\\'s wife fears his anger if gone too long.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Richard and Ada are secretly falling in love after Richard started visiting. Esther realizes it but keeps it to herself. Mr. Jarndyce\\'s eccentric, loud friend Mr. Boythorn arrives very late one night, raging about being misdirected. Boythorn tells of his dispute with the haughty Dedlocks over a footpath, though Esther observes his gentle manner with her and the others. Later, a clerk named Guppy proposes marriage to Esther but she firmly rejects him. \\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn, a reclusive lawyer, visits the law stationer Snagsby seeking the writer of an unusual affidavit - a lodger named Nemo. At Nemo\\'s residence, Tulkinghorn finds a gaunt, unkempt opium user seemingly selling himself to the enemy due to gloomy circumstances. In another scene, Mr. Tulkinghorn, the lawyer, visits the rag and bottle shop where the lodger Nemo lives in squalor and poverty. Tulkinghorn finds Nemo lying disheveled and unwell on a low bed, under the influence of opium. He tries to rouse Nemo by knocking and calling out, in order to investigate him further.'}, {'summary': 'The scene opens in London on a foggy, smoggy day. The High Court of Chancery is in session, and it appears that the fog has settled thickest on this part of London. This is where the legal suit of Jarndyce and Jarndyce is being argued. A little mad old woman (Miss Flite), and a man from Shropshire (Mr. Gridley) are in attendance. A \"sallow prisoner\" is brought forward. Mr. Tangle, a lawyer, speaks with the Lord High Chancellor, and the matter of the two young wards in Jarndyce is discussed. This matter will come up before the court tomorrow.\\n\\nThe scene changes in Chapter 2 to Chesney Wold, a stately home in Lincolnshire. Here the weather is also bad, but it is constant rain rather than fog. The lady of the manor, Lady Dedlock, is bored to death. She had been in London, and has come back to the country seat before leaving for Paris in a few days.\\n\\nLady Dedlock is introduced to us as a very beautiful middle-aged society lady, her charms undimmed by time. She is exceedingly dignified and self-controlled, but her \"caprices,\" which she tries to hide, are known to her servants and tradesmen. She is the wife of Sir Leicester Dedlock, a baronet, who has married somehat beneath him. It is clear that Lady Dedlock has brought neither an aristocratic lineage or a fortune to the marriage. It is also clear that Sir Leicester has such a great amount of both of those things, and loves her so dearly, that it matters not to him.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn, the family solicitor, has come down to Chesney Wold to discuss the Jarndyce case, in which Lady Dedlock has some slight interest. He is a secretive, enigmatic man, of the most controlled and logical character. He brings many legal papers with him, and Lady Dedlock seems to take an interest in the handwriting on one of them. She asks whose writing it is, but Mr. Tulkinghorn cannot answer her. She becomes faint and must be taken to her room.\\n\\nIn Chapter 3, Esther Summerson\\'s life story is told. She has been materially provided for but emotionally neglected by her \"godmother\" in the town of Windsor. When Esther is about fourteen, her godmother dies, and Esther is sent to Greenleaf school. Through Mr. Kenge, John Jarndyce\\'s solicitor, who comes to see Esther after her godmother\\'s death, she learns her benefactor is Mr. Jarndyce. She has never seen him, but he appears, unbeknownst to her until years later, in the carriage that takes her to Greenleaf school. She is sent there after her godmother\\'s death, and passes six happy years there, being taught by the Misses Donny. Her accounts are paid by her unknown benefactor all the while. When she is older she becomes a teacher of the other girls there, and inspires great affection in her students.\\n\\nWhen she has grown old and educated enough to leave Greenleaf school, she is asked to serve in her benefactor\\'s house, Bleak House. She is brought to Chancery Court to meet Ada Clare and Richard Carstone, two wards in the Jarndyce suit, who are also under the guardianship of Mr. Jarndyce. Esther is meant to be Ada\\'s lady companion.\\n\\nAs they leave the court, they meet Miss Flite, who introduces herself. They learn she is also a suitor in Chancery, and observe that she is poor, eccentric, and perhaps a little mad.\\n\\nIn Chapter 4, the three young people are sent to stay the night at the Jellyby household. Mrs. Jellyby is a philanthropic lady who neglects her large and chaotic household in favor of writing long letters, dictated to her eldest daughter Caddy, about the social conditions in places in Africa. Caddy, an overworked waif, clings to Esther and becomes her friend, as does the youngest neglected child, Peepy. ', 'text': 'London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting\\nin Lincoln\\'s Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in\\nthe streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of\\nthe earth, and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus,\\nforty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn\\nHill. Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black\\ndrizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown\\nsnowflakes--gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of\\nthe sun. Dogs, undistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better;\\nsplashed to their very blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one\\nanother\\'s umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper, and losing\\ntheir foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of thousands of other\\nfoot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke\\n(if this day ever broke), adding new deposits to the crust upon crust\\nof mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and\\naccumulating at compound interest.\\n\\nFog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and\\nmeadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers\\nof shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city.\\nFog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping\\ninto the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards and\\nhovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales\\nof barges and small boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient\\nGreenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog\\nin the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper,\\ndown in his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of\\nhis shivering little \\'prentice boy on deck. Chance people on the\\nbridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog\\nall round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the\\nmisty clouds.\\n\\nGas looming through the fog in divers places in the streets, much as\\nthe sun may, from the spongey fields, be seen to loom by husbandman\\nand ploughboy. Most of the shops lighted two hours before their\\ntime--as the gas seems to know, for it has a haggard and unwilling\\nlook.\\n\\nThe raw afternoon is rawest, and the dense fog is densest, and the\\nmuddy streets are muddiest near that leaden-headed old obstruction,\\nappropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed old\\ncorporation, Temple Bar. And hard by Temple Bar, in Lincoln\\'s Inn\\nHall, at the very heart of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor in\\nhis High Court of Chancery.\\n\\nNever can there come fog too thick, never can there come mud and mire\\ntoo deep, to assort with the groping and floundering condition which\\nthis High Court of Chancery, most pestilent of hoary sinners, holds\\nthis day in the sight of heaven and earth.\\n\\nOn such an afternoon, if ever, the Lord High Chancellor ought to be\\nsitting here--as here he is--with a foggy glory round his head,\\nsoftly fenced in with crimson cloth and curtains, addressed by a\\nlarge advocate with great whiskers, a little voice, and an\\ninterminable brief, and outwardly directing his contemplation to the\\nlantern in the roof, where he can see nothing but fog. On such an\\nafternoon some score of members of the High Court of Chancery bar\\nought to be--as here they are--mistily engaged in one of the ten\\nthousand stages of an endless cause, tripping one another up on\\nslippery precedents, groping knee-deep in technicalities, running\\ntheir goat-hair and horsehair warded heads against walls of words and\\nmaking a pretence of equity with serious faces, as players might. On\\nsuch an afternoon the various solicitors in the cause, some two or\\nthree of whom have inherited it from their fathers, who made a\\nfortune by it, ought to be--as are they not?--ranged in a line, in a\\nlong matted well (but you might look in vain for truth at the bottom\\nof it) between the registrar\\'s red table and the silk gowns, with\\nbills, cross-bills, answers, rejoinders, injunctions, affidavits,\\nissues, references to masters, masters\\' reports, mountains of costly\\nnonsense, piled before them. Well may the court be dim, with wasting\\ncandles here and there; well may the fog hang heavy in it, as if it\\nwould never get out; well may the stained-glass windows lose their\\ncolour and admit no light of day into the place; well may the\\nuninitiated from the streets, who peep in through the glass panes in\\nthe door, be deterred from entrance by its owlish aspect and by the\\ndrawl, languidly echoing to the roof from the padded dais where the\\nLord High Chancellor looks into the lantern that has no light in it\\nand where the attendant wigs are all stuck in a fog-bank! This is the\\nCourt of Chancery, which has its decaying houses and its blighted\\nlands in every shire, which has its worn-out lunatic in every\\nmadhouse and its dead in every churchyard, which has its ruined\\nsuitor with his slipshod heels and threadbare dress borrowing and\\nbegging through the round of every man\\'s acquaintance, which gives to\\nmonied might the means abundantly of wearying out the right, which so\\nexhausts finances, patience, courage, hope, so overthrows the brain\\nand breaks the heart, that there is not an honourable man among its\\npractitioners who would not give--who does not often give--the\\nwarning, \"Suffer any wrong that can be done you rather than come\\nhere!\"\\n\\nWho happen to be in the Lord Chancellor\\'s court this murky afternoon\\nbesides the Lord Chancellor, the counsel in the cause, two or three\\ncounsel who are never in any cause, and the well of solicitors before\\nmentioned? There is the registrar below the judge, in wig and gown;\\nand there are two or three maces, or petty-bags, or privy purses, or\\nwhatever they may be, in legal court suits. These are all yawning,\\nfor no crumb of amusement ever falls from Jarndyce and Jarndyce (the\\ncause in hand), which was squeezed dry years upon years ago. The\\nshort-hand writers, the reporters of the court, and the reporters of\\nthe newspapers invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce comes on. Their places are a blank. Standing on\\na seat at the side of the hall, the better to peer into the curtained\\nsanctuary, is a little mad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is\\nalways in court, from its sitting to its rising, and always expecting\\nsome incomprehensible judgment to be given in her favour. Some say\\nshe really is, or was, a party to a suit, but no one knows for\\ncertain because no one cares. She carries some small litter in a\\nreticule which she calls her documents, principally consisting of\\npaper matches and dry lavender. A sallow prisoner has come up, in\\ncustody, for the half-dozenth time to make a personal application \"to\\npurge himself of his contempt,\" which, being a solitary surviving\\nexecutor who has fallen into a state of conglomeration about accounts\\nof which it is not pretended that he had ever any knowledge, he is\\nnot at all likely ever to do. In the meantime his prospects in life\\nare ended. Another ruined suitor, who periodically appears from\\nShropshire and breaks out into efforts to address the Chancellor at\\nthe close of the day\\'s business and who can by no means be made to\\nunderstand that the Chancellor is legally ignorant of his existence\\nafter making it desolate for a quarter of a century, plants himself\\nin a good place and keeps an eye on the judge, ready to call out \"My\\nLord!\" in a voice of sonorous complaint on the instant of his rising.\\nA few lawyers\\' clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger\\non the chance of his furnishing some fun and enlivening the dismal\\nweather a little.\\n\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in\\ncourse of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it\\nmeans. The parties to it understand it least, but it has been\\nobserved that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five\\nminutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the\\npremises. Innumerable children have been born into the cause;\\ninnumerable young people have married into it; innumerable old people\\nhave died out of it. Scores of persons have deliriously found\\nthemselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without knowing how\\nor why; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the\\nsuit. The little plaintiff or defendant who was promised a new\\nrocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled has grown\\nup, possessed himself of a real horse, and trotted away into the\\nother world. Fair wards of court have faded into mothers and\\ngrandmothers; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone\\nout; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere\\nbills of mortality; there are not three Jarndyces left upon the earth\\nperhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a\\ncoffee-house in Chancery Lane; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags\\nits dreary length before the court, perennially hopeless.\\n\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce has passed into a joke. That is the only good\\nthat has ever come of it. It has been death to many, but it is a joke\\nin the profession. Every master in Chancery has had a reference out\\nof it. Every Chancellor was \"in it,\" for somebody or other, when he\\nwas counsel at the bar. Good things have been said about it by\\nblue-nosed, bulbous-shoed old benchers in select port-wine committee\\nafter dinner in hall. Articled clerks have been in the habit of\\nfleshing their legal wit upon it. The last Lord Chancellor handled it\\nneatly, when, correcting Mr. Blowers, the eminent silk gown who said\\nthat such a thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes, he\\nobserved, \"or when we get through Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mr.\\nBlowers\"--a pleasantry that particularly tickled the maces, bags, and\\npurses.\\n\\nHow many people out of the suit Jarndyce and Jarndyce has stretched\\nforth its unwholesome hand to spoil and corrupt would be a very wide\\nquestion. From the master upon whose impaling files reams of dusty\\nwarrants in Jarndyce and Jarndyce have grimly writhed into many\\nshapes, down to the copying-clerk in the Six Clerks\\' Office who has\\ncopied his tens of thousands of Chancery folio-pages under that\\neternal heading, no man\\'s nature has been made better by it. In\\ntrickery, evasion, procrastination, spoliation, botheration, under\\nfalse pretences of all sorts, there are influences that can never\\ncome to good. The very solicitors\\' boys who have kept the wretched\\nsuitors at bay, by protesting time out of mind that Mr. Chizzle,\\nMizzle, or otherwise was particularly engaged and had appointments\\nuntil dinner, may have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into\\nthemselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The receiver in the cause\\nhas acquired a goodly sum of money by it but has acquired too a\\ndistrust of his own mother and a contempt for his own kind. Chizzle,\\nMizzle, and otherwise have lapsed into a habit of vaguely promising\\nthemselves that they will look into that outstanding little matter\\nand see what can be done for Drizzle--who was not well used--when\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of the office. Shirking and\\nsharking in all their many varieties have been sown broadcast by the\\nill-fated cause; and even those who have contemplated its history\\nfrom the outermost circle of such evil have been insensibly tempted\\ninto a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad\\ncourse, and a loose belief that if the world go wrong it was in some\\noff-hand manner never meant to go right.\\n\\nThus, in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog, sits the\\nLord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery.\\n\\n\"Mr. Tangle,\" says the Lord High Chancellor, latterly something\\nrestless under the eloquence of that learned gentleman.\\n\\n\"Mlud,\" says Mr. Tangle. Mr. Tangle knows more of Jarndyce and\\nJarndyce than anybody. He is famous for it--supposed never to have\\nread anything else since he left school.\\n\\n\"Have you nearly concluded your argument?\"\\n\\n\"Mlud, no--variety of points--feel it my duty tsubmit--ludship,\" is\\nthe reply that slides out of Mr. Tangle.\\n\\n\"Several members of the bar are still to be heard, I believe?\" says\\nthe Chancellor with a slight smile.\\n\\nEighteen of Mr. Tangle\\'s learned friends, each armed with a little\\nsummary of eighteen hundred sheets, bob up like eighteen hammers in a\\npianoforte, make eighteen bows, and drop into their eighteen places\\nof obscurity.\\n\\n\"We will proceed with the hearing on Wednesday fortnight,\" says the\\nChancellor. For the question at issue is only a question of costs, a\\nmere bud on the forest tree of the parent suit, and really will come\\nto a settlement one of these days.\\n\\nThe Chancellor rises; the bar rises; the prisoner is brought forward\\nin a hurry; the man from Shropshire cries, \"My lord!\" Maces, bags,\\nand purses indignantly proclaim silence and frown at the man from\\nShropshire.\\n\\n\"In reference,\" proceeds the Chancellor, still on Jarndyce and\\nJarndyce, \"to the young girl--\"\\n\\n\"Begludship\\'s pardon--boy,\" says Mr. Tangle prematurely. \"In\\nreference,\" proceeds the Chancellor with extra distinctness, \"to the\\nyoung girl and boy, the two young people\"--Mr. Tangle crushed--\"whom\\nI directed to be in attendance to-day and who are now in my private\\nroom, I will see them and satisfy myself as to the expediency of\\nmaking the order for their residing with their uncle.\"\\n\\nMr. Tangle on his legs again. \"Begludship\\'s pardon--dead.\"\\n\\n\"With their\"--Chancellor looking through his double eye-glass at the\\npapers on his desk--\"grandfather.\"\\n\\n\"Begludship\\'s pardon--victim of rash action--brains.\"\\n\\nSuddenly a very little counsel with a terrific bass voice arises,\\nfully inflated, in the back settlements of the fog, and says, \"Will\\nyour lordship allow me? I appear for him. He is a cousin, several\\ntimes removed. I am not at the moment prepared to inform the court in\\nwhat exact remove he is a cousin, but he IS a cousin.\"\\n\\nLeaving this address (delivered like a sepulchral message) ringing in\\nthe rafters of the roof, the very little counsel drops, and the fog\\nknows him no more. Everybody looks for him. Nobody can see him.\\n\\n\"I will speak with both the young people,\" says the Chancellor anew,\\n\"and satisfy myself on the subject of their residing with their\\ncousin. I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I take my\\nseat.\"\\n\\nThe Chancellor is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is\\npresented. Nothing can possibly come of the prisoner\\'s conglomeration\\nbut his being sent back to prison, which is soon done. The man from\\nShropshire ventures another remonstrative \"My lord!\" but the\\nChancellor, being aware of him, has dexterously vanished. Everybody\\nelse quickly vanishes too. A battery of blue bags is loaded with\\nheavy charges of papers and carried off by clerks; the little mad old\\nwoman marches off with her documents; the empty court is locked up.\\nIf all the injustice it has committed and all the misery it has\\ncaused could only be locked up with it, and the whole burnt away in a\\ngreat funeral pyre--why so much the better for other parties than the\\nparties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce!\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this same\\nmiry afternoon. It is not so unlike the Court of Chancery but that we\\nmay pass from the one scene to the other, as the crow flies. Both the\\nworld of fashion and the Court of Chancery are things of precedent\\nand usage: oversleeping Rip Van Winkles who have played at strange\\ngames through a deal of thundery weather; sleeping beauties whom the\\nknight will wake one day, when all the stopped spits in the kitchen\\nshall begin to turn prodigiously!\\n\\nIt is not a large world. Relatively even to this world of ours, which\\nhas its limits too (as your Highness shall find when you have made\\nthe tour of it and are come to the brink of the void beyond), it is a\\nvery little speck. There is much good in it; there are many good and\\ntrue people in it; it has its appointed place. But the evil of it is\\nthat it is a world wrapped up in too much jeweller\\'s cotton and fine\\nwool, and cannot hear the rushing of the larger worlds, and cannot\\nsee them as they circle round the sun. It is a deadened world, and\\nits growth is sometimes unhealthy for want of air.\\n\\nMy Lady Dedlock has returned to her house in town for a few days\\nprevious to her departure for Paris, where her ladyship intends to\\nstay some weeks, after which her movements are uncertain. The\\nfashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the Parisians,\\nand it knows all fashionable things. To know things otherwise were to\\nbe unfashionable. My Lady Dedlock has been down at what she calls, in\\nfamiliar conversation, her \"place\" in Lincolnshire. The waters are\\nout in Lincolnshire. An arch of the bridge in the park has been\\nsapped and sopped away. The adjacent low-lying ground for half a mile\\nin breadth is a stagnant river with melancholy trees for islands in\\nit and a surface punctured all over, all day long, with falling rain.\\nMy Lady Dedlock\\'s place has been extremely dreary. The weather for\\nmany a day and night has been so wet that the trees seem wet through,\\nand the soft loppings and prunings of the woodman\\'s axe can make no\\ncrash or crackle as they fall. The deer, looking soaked, leave\\nquagmires where they pass. The shot of a rifle loses its sharpness in\\nthe moist air, and its smoke moves in a tardy little cloud towards\\nthe green rise, coppice-topped, that makes a background for the\\nfalling rain. The view from my Lady Dedlock\\'s own windows is\\nalternately a lead-coloured view and a view in Indian ink. The vases\\non the stone terrace in the foreground catch the rain all day; and\\nthe heavy drops fall--drip, drip, drip--upon the broad flagged\\npavement, called from old time the Ghost\\'s Walk, all night. On\\nSundays the little church in the park is mouldy; the oaken pulpit\\nbreaks out into a cold sweat; and there is a general smell and taste\\nas of the ancient Dedlocks in their graves. My Lady Dedlock (who is\\nchildless), looking out in the early twilight from her boudoir at a\\nkeeper\\'s lodge and seeing the light of a fire upon the latticed\\npanes, and smoke rising from the chimney, and a child, chased by a\\nwoman, running out into the rain to meet the shining figure of a\\nwrapped-up man coming through the gate, has been put quite out of\\ntemper. My Lady Dedlock says she has been \"bored to death.\"\\n\\nTherefore my Lady Dedlock has come away from the place in\\nLincolnshire and has left it to the rain, and the crows, and the\\nrabbits, and the deer, and the partridges and pheasants. The pictures\\nof the Dedlocks past and gone have seemed to vanish into the damp\\nwalls in mere lowness of spirits, as the housekeeper has passed along\\nthe old rooms shutting up the shutters. And when they will next come\\nforth again, the fashionable intelligence--which, like the fiend, is\\nomniscient of the past and present, but not the future--cannot yet\\nundertake to say.\\n\\nSir Leicester Dedlock is only a baronet, but there is no mightier\\nbaronet than he. His family is as old as the hills, and infinitely\\nmore respectable. He has a general opinion that the world might get\\non without hills but would be done up without Dedlocks. He would on\\nthe whole admit nature to be a good idea (a little low, perhaps, when\\nnot enclosed with a park-fence), but an idea dependent for its\\nexecution on your great county families. He is a gentleman of strict\\nconscience, disdainful of all littleness and meanness and ready on\\nthe shortest notice to die any death you may please to mention rather\\nthan give occasion for the least impeachment of his integrity. He is\\nan honourable, obstinate, truthful, high-spirited, intensely\\nprejudiced, perfectly unreasonable man.\\n\\nSir Leicester is twenty years, full measure, older than my Lady. He\\nwill never see sixty-five again, nor perhaps sixty-six, nor yet\\nsixty-seven. He has a twist of the gout now and then and walks a\\nlittle stiffly. He is of a worthy presence, with his light-grey hair\\nand whiskers, his fine shirt-frill, his pure-white waistcoat, and his\\nblue coat with bright buttons always buttoned. He is ceremonious,\\nstately, most polite on every occasion to my Lady, and holds her\\npersonal attractions in the highest estimation. His gallantry to my\\nLady, which has never changed since he courted her, is the one little\\ntouch of romantic fancy in him.\\n\\nIndeed, he married her for love. A whisper still goes about that she\\nhad not even family; howbeit, Sir Leicester had so much family that\\nperhaps he had enough and could dispense with any more. But she had\\nbeauty, pride, ambition, insolent resolve, and sense enough to\\nportion out a legion of fine ladies. Wealth and station, added to\\nthese, soon floated her upward, and for years now my Lady Dedlock has\\nbeen at the centre of the fashionable intelligence and at the top of\\nthe fashionable tree.\\n\\nHow Alexander wept when he had no more worlds to conquer, everybody\\nknows--or has some reason to know by this time, the matter having\\nbeen rather frequently mentioned. My Lady Dedlock, having conquered\\nHER world, fell not into the melting, but rather into the freezing,\\nmood. An exhausted composure, a worn-out placidity, an equanimity of\\nfatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction, are the\\ntrophies of her victory. She is perfectly well-bred. If she could be\\ntranslated to heaven to-morrow, she might be expected to ascend\\nwithout any rapture.\\n\\nShe has beauty still, and if it be not in its heyday, it is not yet\\nin its autumn. She has a fine face--originally of a character that\\nwould be rather called very pretty than handsome, but improved into\\nclassicality by the acquired expression of her fashionable state. Her\\nfigure is elegant and has the effect of being tall. Not that she is\\nso, but that \"the most is made,\" as the Honourable Bob Stables has\\nfrequently asserted upon oath, \"of all her points.\" The same\\nauthority observes that she is perfectly got up and remarks in\\ncommendation of her hair especially that she is the best-groomed\\nwoman in the whole stud.\\n\\nWith all her perfections on her head, my Lady Dedlock has come up\\nfrom her place in Lincolnshire (hotly pursued by the fashionable\\nintelligence) to pass a few days at her house in town previous to her\\ndeparture for Paris, where her ladyship intends to stay some weeks,\\nafter which her movements are uncertain. And at her house in town,\\nupon this muddy, murky afternoon, presents himself an old-fashioned\\nold gentleman, attorney-at-law and eke solicitor of the High Court of\\nChancery, who has the honour of acting as legal adviser of the\\nDedlocks and has as many cast-iron boxes in his office with that name\\noutside as if the present baronet were the coin of the conjuror\\'s\\ntrick and were constantly being juggled through the whole set. Across\\nthe hall, and up the stairs, and along the passages, and through the\\nrooms, which are very brilliant in the season and very dismal out of\\nit--fairy-land to visit, but a desert to live in--the old gentleman\\nis conducted by a Mercury in powder to my Lady\\'s presence.\\n\\nThe old gentleman is rusty to look at, but is reputed to have made\\ngood thrift out of aristocratic marriage settlements and aristocratic\\nwills, and to be very rich. He is surrounded by a mysterious halo of\\nfamily confidences, of which he is known to be the silent depository.\\nThere are noble mausoleums rooted for centuries in retired glades of\\nparks among the growing timber and the fern, which perhaps hold fewer\\nnoble secrets than walk abroad among men, shut up in the breast of\\nMr. Tulkinghorn. He is of what is called the old school--a phrase\\ngenerally meaning any school that seems never to have been young--and\\nwears knee-breeches tied with ribbons, and gaiters or stockings. One\\npeculiarity of his black clothes and of his black stockings, be they\\nsilk or worsted, is that they never shine. Mute, close, irresponsive\\nto any glancing light, his dress is like himself. He never converses\\nwhen not professionally consulted. He is found sometimes, speechless\\nbut quite at home, at corners of dinner-tables in great country\\nhouses and near doors of drawing-rooms, concerning which the\\nfashionable intelligence is eloquent, where everybody knows him and\\nwhere half the Peerage stops to say \"How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?\"\\nHe receives these salutations with gravity and buries them along with\\nthe rest of his knowledge.\\n\\nSir Leicester Dedlock is with my Lady and is happy to see Mr.\\nTulkinghorn. There is an air of prescription about him which is\\nalways agreeable to Sir Leicester; he receives it as a kind of\\ntribute. He likes Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s dress; there is a kind of tribute\\nin that too. It is eminently respectable, and likewise, in a general\\nway, retainer-like. It expresses, as it were, the steward of the\\nlegal mysteries, the butler of the legal cellar, of the Dedlocks.\\n\\nHas Mr. Tulkinghorn any idea of this himself? It may be so, or it may\\nnot, but there is this remarkable circumstance to be noted in\\neverything associated with my Lady Dedlock as one of a class--as one\\nof the leaders and representatives of her little world. She supposes\\nherself to be an inscrutable Being, quite out of the reach and ken of\\nordinary mortals--seeing herself in her glass, where indeed she looks\\nso. Yet every dim little star revolving about her, from her maid to\\nthe manager of the Italian Opera, knows her weaknesses, prejudices,\\nfollies, haughtinesses, and caprices and lives upon as accurate a\\ncalculation and as nice a measure of her moral nature as her\\ndressmaker takes of her physical proportions. Is a new dress, a new\\ncustom, a new singer, a new dancer, a new form of jewellery, a new\\ndwarf or giant, a new chapel, a new anything, to be set up? There are\\ndeferential people in a dozen callings whom my Lady Dedlock suspects\\nof nothing but prostration before her, who can tell you how to manage\\nher as if she were a baby, who do nothing but nurse her all their\\nlives, who, humbly affecting to follow with profound subservience,\\nlead her and her whole troop after them; who, in hooking one, hook\\nall and bear them off as Lemuel Gulliver bore away the stately fleet\\nof the majestic Lilliput. \"If you want to address our people, sir,\"\\nsay Blaze and Sparkle, the jewellers--meaning by our people Lady\\nDedlock and the rest--\"you must remember that you are not dealing\\nwith the general public; you must hit our people in their weakest\\nplace, and their weakest place is such a place.\" \"To make this\\narticle go down, gentlemen,\" say Sheen and Gloss, the mercers, to\\ntheir friends the manufacturers, \"you must come to us, because we\\nknow where to have the fashionable people, and we can make it\\nfashionable.\" \"If you want to get this print upon the tables of my\\nhigh connexion, sir,\" says Mr. Sladdery, the librarian, \"or if you\\nwant to get this dwarf or giant into the houses of my high connexion,\\nsir, or if you want to secure to this entertainment the patronage of\\nmy high connexion, sir, you must leave it, if you please, to me, for\\nI have been accustomed to study the leaders of my high connexion,\\nsir, and I may tell you without vanity that I can turn them round my\\nfinger\"--in which Mr. Sladdery, who is an honest man, does not\\nexaggerate at all.\\n\\nTherefore, while Mr. Tulkinghorn may not know what is passing in the\\nDedlock mind at present, it is very possible that he may.\\n\\n\"My Lady\\'s cause has been again before the Chancellor, has it, Mr.\\nTulkinghorn?\" says Sir Leicester, giving him his hand.\\n\\n\"Yes. It has been on again to-day,\" Mr. Tulkinghorn replies, making\\none of his quiet bows to my Lady, who is on a sofa near the fire,\\nshading her face with a hand-screen.\\n\\n\"It would be useless to ask,\" says my Lady with the dreariness of the\\nplace in Lincolnshire still upon her, \"whether anything has been\\ndone.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing that YOU would call anything has been done to-day,\" replies\\nMr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"Nor ever will be,\" says my Lady.\\n\\nSir Leicester has no objection to an interminable Chancery suit. It\\nis a slow, expensive, British, constitutional kind of thing. To be\\nsure, he has not a vital interest in the suit in question, her part\\nin which was the only property my Lady brought him; and he has a\\nshadowy impression that for his name--the name of Dedlock--to be in a\\ncause, and not in the title of that cause, is a most ridiculous\\naccident. But he regards the Court of Chancery, even if it should\\ninvolve an occasional delay of justice and a trifling amount of\\nconfusion, as a something devised in conjunction with a variety of\\nother somethings by the perfection of human wisdom for the eternal\\nsettlement (humanly speaking) of everything. And he is upon the whole\\nof a fixed opinion that to give the sanction of his countenance to\\nany complaints respecting it would be to encourage some person in the\\nlower classes to rise up somewhere--like Wat Tyler.\\n\\n\"As a few fresh affidavits have been put upon the file,\" says Mr.\\nTulkinghorn, \"and as they are short, and as I proceed upon the\\ntroublesome principle of begging leave to possess my clients with any\\nnew proceedings in a cause\"--cautious man Mr. Tulkinghorn, taking no\\nmore responsibility than necessary--\"and further, as I see you are\\ngoing to Paris, I have brought them in my pocket.\"\\n\\n(Sir Leicester was going to Paris too, by the by, but the delight of\\nthe fashionable intelligence was in his Lady.)\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn takes out his papers, asks permission to place them\\non a golden talisman of a table at my Lady\\'s elbow, puts on his\\nspectacles, and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp.\\n\\n\"\\'In Chancery. Between John Jarndyce--\\'\"\\n\\nMy Lady interrupts, requesting him to miss as many of the formal\\nhorrors as he can.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn glances over his spectacles and begins again lower\\ndown. My Lady carelessly and scornfully abstracts her attention. Sir\\nLeicester in a great chair looks at the file and appears to have a\\nstately liking for the legal repetitions and prolixities as ranging\\namong the national bulwarks. It happens that the fire is hot where my\\nLady sits and that the hand-screen is more beautiful than useful,\\nbeing priceless but small. My Lady, changing her position, sees the\\npapers on the table--looks at them nearer--looks at them nearer\\nstill--asks impulsively, \"Who copied that?\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn stops short, surprised by my Lady\\'s animation and her\\nunusual tone.\\n\\n\"Is it what you people call law-hand?\" she asks, looking full at him\\nin her careless way again and toying with her screen.\\n\\n\"Not quite. Probably\"--Mr. Tulkinghorn examines it as he speaks--\"the\\nlegal character which it has was acquired after the original hand was\\nformed. Why do you ask?\"\\n\\n\"Anything to vary this detestable monotony. Oh, go on, do!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn reads again. The heat is greater; my Lady screens her\\nface. Sir Leicester dozes, starts up suddenly, and cries, \"Eh? What\\ndo you say?\"\\n\\n\"I say I am afraid,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, who had risen hastily,\\n\"that Lady Dedlock is ill.\"\\n\\n\"Faint,\" my Lady murmurs with white lips, \"only that; but it is like\\nthe faintness of death. Don\\'t speak to me. Ring, and take me to my\\nroom!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn retires into another chamber; bells ring, feet\\nshuffle and patter, silence ensues. Mercury at last begs Mr.\\nTulkinghorn to return.\\n\\n\"Better now,\" quoth Sir Leicester, motioning the lawyer to sit down\\nand read to him alone. \"I have been quite alarmed. I never knew my\\nLady swoon before. But the weather is extremely trying, and she\\nreally has been bored to death down at our place in Lincolnshire.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my portion of\\nthese pages, for I know I am not clever. I always knew that. I can\\nremember, when I was a very little girl indeed, I used to say to my\\ndoll when we were alone together, \"Now, Dolly, I am not clever, you\\nknow very well, and you must be patient with me, like a dear!\" And so\\nshe used to sit propped up in a great arm-chair, with her beautiful\\ncomplexion and rosy lips, staring at me--or not so much at me, I\\nthink, as at nothing--while I busily stitched away and told her every\\none of my secrets.\\n\\nMy dear old doll! I was such a shy little thing that I seldom dared\\nto open my lips, and never dared to open my heart, to anybody else.\\nIt almost makes me cry to think what a relief it used to be to me\\nwhen I came home from school of a day to run upstairs to my room and\\nsay, \"Oh, you dear faithful Dolly, I knew you would be expecting me!\"\\nand then to sit down on the floor, leaning on the elbow of her great\\nchair, and tell her all I had noticed since we parted. I had always\\nrather a noticing way--not a quick way, oh, no!--a silent way of\\nnoticing what passed before me and thinking I should like to\\nunderstand it better. I have not by any means a quick understanding.\\nWhen I love a person very tenderly indeed, it seems to brighten. But\\neven that may be my vanity.\\n\\nI was brought up, from my earliest remembrance--like some of the\\nprincesses in the fairy stories, only I was not charming--by my\\ngodmother. At least, I only knew her as such. She was a good, good\\nwoman! She went to church three times every Sunday, and to morning\\nprayers on Wednesdays and Fridays, and to lectures whenever there\\nwere lectures; and never missed. She was handsome; and if she had\\never smiled, would have been (I used to think) like an angel--but she\\nnever smiled. She was always grave and strict. She was so very good\\nherself, I thought, that the badness of other people made her frown\\nall her life. I felt so different from her, even making every\\nallowance for the differences between a child and a woman; I felt so\\npoor, so trifling, and so far off that I never could be unrestrained\\nwith her--no, could never even love her as I wished. It made me very\\nsorry to consider how good she was and how unworthy of her I was, and\\nI used ardently to hope that I might have a better heart; and I\\ntalked it over very often with the dear old doll, but I never loved\\nmy godmother as I ought to have loved her and as I felt I must have\\nloved her if I had been a better girl.\\n\\nThis made me, I dare say, more timid and retiring than I naturally\\nwas and cast me upon Dolly as the only friend with whom I felt at\\nease. But something happened when I was still quite a little thing\\nthat helped it very much.\\n\\nI had never heard my mama spoken of. I had never heard of my papa\\neither, but I felt more interested about my mama. I had never worn a\\nblack frock, that I could recollect. I had never been shown my mama\\'s\\ngrave. I had never been told where it was. Yet I had never been\\ntaught to pray for any relation but my godmother. I had more than\\nonce approached this subject of my thoughts with Mrs. Rachael, our\\nonly servant, who took my light away when I was in bed (another very\\ngood woman, but austere to me), and she had only said, \"Esther, good\\nnight!\" and gone away and left me.\\n\\nAlthough there were seven girls at the neighbouring school where I\\nwas a day boarder, and although they called me little Esther\\nSummerson, I knew none of them at home. All of them were older than\\nI, to be sure (I was the youngest there by a good deal), but there\\nseemed to be some other separation between us besides that, and\\nbesides their being far more clever than I was and knowing much more\\nthan I did. One of them in the first week of my going to the school\\n(I remember it very well) invited me home to a little party, to my\\ngreat joy. But my godmother wrote a stiff letter declining for me,\\nand I never went. I never went out at all.\\n\\nIt was my birthday. There were holidays at school on other\\nbirthdays--none on mine. There were rejoicings at home on other\\nbirthdays, as I knew from what I heard the girls relate to one\\nanother--there were none on mine. My birthday was the most melancholy\\nday at home in the whole year.\\n\\nI have mentioned that unless my vanity should deceive me (as I know\\nit may, for I may be very vain without suspecting it, though indeed I\\ndon\\'t), my comprehension is quickened when my affection is. My\\ndisposition is very affectionate, and perhaps I might still feel such\\na wound if such a wound could be received more than once with the\\nquickness of that birthday.\\n\\nDinner was over, and my godmother and I were sitting at the table\\nbefore the fire. The clock ticked, the fire clicked; not another\\nsound had been heard in the room or in the house for I don\\'t know how\\nlong. I happened to look timidly up from my stitching, across the\\ntable at my godmother, and I saw in her face, looking gloomily at me,\\n\"It would have been far better, little Esther, that you had had no\\nbirthday, that you had never been born!\"\\n\\nI broke out crying and sobbing, and I said, \"Oh, dear godmother, tell\\nme, pray do tell me, did Mama die on my birthday?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" she returned. \"Ask me no more, child!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, do pray tell me something of her. Do now, at last, dear\\ngodmother, if you please! What did I do to her? How did I lose her?\\nWhy am I so different from other children, and why is it my fault,\\ndear godmother? No, no, no, don\\'t go away. Oh, speak to me!\"\\n\\nI was in a kind of fright beyond my grief, and I caught hold of her\\ndress and was kneeling to her. She had been saying all the while,\\n\"Let me go!\" But now she stood still.\\n\\nHer darkened face had such power over me that it stopped me in the\\nmidst of my vehemence. I put up my trembling little hand to clasp\\nhers or to beg her pardon with what earnestness I might, but withdrew\\nit as she looked at me, and laid it on my fluttering heart. She\\nraised me, sat in her chair, and standing me before her, said slowly\\nin a cold, low voice--I see her knitted brow and pointed\\nfinger--\"Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers.\\nThe time will come--and soon enough--when you will understand this\\nbetter and will feel it too, as no one save a woman can. I have\\nforgiven her\"--but her face did not relent--\"the wrong she did to me,\\nand I say no more of it, though it was greater than you will ever\\nknow--than any one will ever know but I, the sufferer. For yourself,\\nunfortunate girl, orphaned and degraded from the first of these evil\\nanniversaries, pray daily that the sins of others be not visited upon\\nyour head, according to what is written. Forget your mother and leave\\nall other people to forget her who will do her unhappy child that\\ngreatest kindness. Now, go!\"\\n\\nShe checked me, however, as I was about to depart from her--so frozen\\nas I was!--and added this, \"Submission, self-denial, diligent work,\\nare the preparations for a life begun with such a shadow on it. You\\nare different from other children, Esther, because you were not born,\\nlike them, in common sinfulness and wrath. You are set apart.\"\\n\\nI went up to my room, and crept to bed, and laid my doll\\'s cheek\\nagainst mine wet with tears, and holding that solitary friend upon my\\nbosom, cried myself to sleep. Imperfect as my understanding of my\\nsorrow was, I knew that I had brought no joy at any time to anybody\\'s\\nheart and that I was to no one upon earth what Dolly was to me.\\n\\nDear, dear, to think how much time we passed alone together\\nafterwards, and how often I repeated to the doll the story of my\\nbirthday and confided to her that I would try as hard as ever I could\\nto repair the fault I had been born with (of which I confessedly felt\\nguilty and yet innocent) and would strive as I grew up to be\\nindustrious, contented, and kind-hearted and to do some good to some\\none, and win some love to myself if I could. I hope it is not\\nself-indulgent to shed these tears as I think of it. I am very\\nthankful, I am very cheerful, but I cannot quite help their coming to\\nmy eyes.\\n\\nThere! I have wiped them away now and can go on again properly.\\n\\nI felt the distance between my godmother and myself so much more\\nafter the birthday, and felt so sensible of filling a place in her\\nhouse which ought to have been empty, that I found her more difficult\\nof approach, though I was fervently grateful to her in my heart, than\\never. I felt in the same way towards my school companions; I felt in\\nthe same way towards Mrs. Rachael, who was a widow; and oh, towards\\nher daughter, of whom she was proud, who came to see her once a\\nfortnight! I was very retired and quiet, and tried to be very\\ndiligent.\\n\\nOne sunny afternoon when I had come home from school with my books\\nand portfolio, watching my long shadow at my side, and as I was\\ngliding upstairs to my room as usual, my godmother looked out of the\\nparlour-door and called me back. Sitting with her, I found--which was\\nvery unusual indeed--a stranger. A portly, important-looking\\ngentleman, dressed all in black, with a white cravat, large gold\\nwatch seals, a pair of gold eye-glasses, and a large seal-ring upon\\nhis little finger.\\n\\n\"This,\" said my godmother in an undertone, \"is the child.\" Then she\\nsaid in her naturally stern way of speaking, \"This is Esther, sir.\"\\n\\nThe gentleman put up his eye-glasses to look at me and said, \"Come\\nhere, my dear!\" He shook hands with me and asked me to take off my\\nbonnet, looking at me all the while. When I had complied, he said,\\n\"Ah!\" and afterwards \"Yes!\" And then, taking off his eye-glasses and\\nfolding them in a red case, and leaning back in his arm-chair,\\nturning the case about in his two hands, he gave my godmother a nod.\\nUpon that, my godmother said, \"You may go upstairs, Esther!\" And I\\nmade him my curtsy and left him.\\n\\nIt must have been two years afterwards, and I was almost fourteen,\\nwhen one dreadful night my godmother and I sat at the fireside. I was\\nreading aloud, and she was listening. I had come down at nine o\\'clock\\nas I always did to read the Bible to her, and was reading from St.\\nJohn how our Saviour stooped down, writing with his finger in the\\ndust, when they brought the sinful woman to him.\\n\\n\"So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself and said\\nunto them, \\'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a\\nstone at her!\\'\"\\n\\nI was stopped by my godmother\\'s rising, putting her hand to her head,\\nand crying out in an awful voice from quite another part of the book,\\n\"\\'Watch ye, therefore, lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And\\nwhat I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch!\\'\"\\n\\nIn an instant, while she stood before me repeating these words, she\\nfell down on the floor. I had no need to cry out; her voice had\\nsounded through the house and been heard in the street.\\n\\nShe was laid upon her bed. For more than a week she lay there, little\\naltered outwardly, with her old handsome resolute frown that I so\\nwell knew carved upon her face. Many and many a time, in the day and\\nin the night, with my head upon the pillow by her that my whispers\\nmight be plainer to her, I kissed her, thanked her, prayed for her,\\nasked her for her blessing and forgiveness, entreated her to give me\\nthe least sign that she knew or heard me. No, no, no. Her face was\\nimmovable. To the very last, and even afterwards, her frown remained\\nunsoftened.\\n\\nOn the day after my poor good godmother was buried, the gentleman in\\nblack with the white neckcloth reappeared. I was sent for by Mrs.\\nRachael, and found him in the same place, as if he had never gone\\naway.\\n\\n\"My name is Kenge,\" he said; \"you may remember it, my child; Kenge\\nand Carboy, Lincoln\\'s Inn.\"\\n\\nI replied that I remembered to have seen him once before.\\n\\n\"Pray be seated--here near me. Don\\'t distress yourself; it\\'s of no\\nuse. Mrs. Rachael, I needn\\'t inform you who were acquainted with the\\nlate Miss Barbary\\'s affairs, that her means die with her and that\\nthis young lady, now her aunt is dead--\"\\n\\n\"My aunt, sir!\"\\n\\n\"It is really of no use carrying on a deception when no object is to\\nbe gained by it,\" said Mr. Kenge smoothly, \"Aunt in fact, though not\\nin law. Don\\'t distress yourself! Don\\'t weep! Don\\'t tremble! Mrs.\\nRachael, our young friend has no doubt heard of--the--a--Jarndyce and\\nJarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Never,\" said Mrs. Rachael.\\n\\n\"Is it possible,\" pursued Mr. Kenge, putting up his eye-glasses,\\n\"that our young friend--I BEG you won\\'t distress yourself!--never\\nheard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce!\"\\n\\nI shook my head, wondering even what it was.\\n\\n\"Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce?\" said Mr. Kenge, looking over his\\nglasses at me and softly turning the case about and about as if he\\nwere petting something. \"Not of one of the greatest Chancery suits\\nknown? Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce--the--a--in itself a monument of\\nChancery practice. In which (I would say) every difficulty, every\\ncontingency, every masterly fiction, every form of procedure known\\nin that court, is represented over and over again? It is a cause\\nthat could not exist out of this free and great country. I should\\nsay that the aggregate of costs in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mrs.\\nRachael\"--I was afraid he addressed himself to her because I appeared\\ninattentive\"--amounts at the present hour to from SIX-ty to SEVEN-ty\\nTHOUSAND POUNDS!\" said Mr. Kenge, leaning back in his chair.\\n\\nI felt very ignorant, but what could I do? I was so entirely\\nunacquainted with the subject that I understood nothing about it even\\nthen.\\n\\n\"And she really never heard of the cause!\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\"Surprising!\"\\n\\n\"Miss Barbary, sir,\" returned Mrs. Rachael, \"who is now among the\\nSeraphim--\"\\n\\n\"I hope so, I am sure,\" said Mr. Kenge politely.\\n\\n\"--Wished Esther only to know what would be serviceable to her. And\\nshe knows, from any teaching she has had here, nothing more.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Upon the whole, very proper. Now to the\\npoint,\" addressing me. \"Miss Barbary, your sole relation (in fact\\nthat is, for I am bound to observe that in law you had none) being\\ndeceased and it naturally not being to be expected that Mrs.\\nRachael--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear no!\" said Mrs. Rachael quickly.\\n\\n\"Quite so,\" assented Mr. Kenge; \"--that Mrs. Rachael should charge\\nherself with your maintenance and support (I beg you won\\'t distress\\nyourself), you are in a position to receive the renewal of an offer\\nwhich I was instructed to make to Miss Barbary some two years ago and\\nwhich, though rejected then, was understood to be renewable under the\\nlamentable circumstances that have since occurred. Now, if I avow\\nthat I represent, in Jarndyce and Jarndyce and otherwise, a highly\\nhumane, but at the same time singular, man, shall I compromise myself\\nby any stretch of my professional caution?\" said Mr. Kenge, leaning\\nback in his chair again and looking calmly at us both.\\n\\nHe appeared to enjoy beyond everything the sound of his own voice. I\\ncouldn\\'t wonder at that, for it was mellow and full and gave great\\nimportance to every word he uttered. He listened to himself with\\nobvious satisfaction and sometimes gently beat time to his own music\\nwith his head or rounded a sentence with his hand. I was very much\\nimpressed by him--even then, before I knew that he formed himself on\\nthe model of a great lord who was his client and that he was\\ngenerally called Conversation Kenge.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he pursued, \"being aware of the--I would say,\\ndesolate--position of our young friend, offers to place her at a\\nfirst-rate establishment where her education shall be completed,\\nwhere her comfort shall be secured, where her reasonable wants shall\\nbe anticipated, where she shall be eminently qualified to discharge\\nher duty in that station of life unto which it has pleased--shall I\\nsay Providence?--to call her.\"\\n\\nMy heart was filled so full, both by what he said and by his\\naffecting manner of saying it, that I was not able to speak, though I\\ntried.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he went on, \"makes no condition beyond expressing his\\nexpectation that our young friend will not at any time remove herself\\nfrom the establishment in question without his knowledge and\\nconcurrence. That she will faithfully apply herself to the\\nacquisition of those accomplishments, upon the exercise of which she\\nwill be ultimately dependent. That she will tread in the paths of\\nvirtue and honour, and--the--a--so forth.\"\\n\\nI was still less able to speak than before.\\n\\n\"Now, what does our young friend say?\" proceeded Mr. Kenge. \"Take\\ntime, take time! I pause for her reply. But take time!\"\\n\\nWhat the destitute subject of such an offer tried to say, I need not\\nrepeat. What she did say, I could more easily tell, if it were worth\\nthe telling. What she felt, and will feel to her dying hour, I could\\nnever relate.\\n\\nThis interview took place at Windsor, where I had passed (as far as I\\nknew) my whole life. On that day week, amply provided with all\\nnecessaries, I left it, inside the stagecoach, for Reading.\\n\\nMrs. Rachael was too good to feel any emotion at parting, but I was\\nnot so good, and wept bitterly. I thought that I ought to have known\\nher better after so many years and ought to have made myself enough\\nof a favourite with her to make her sorry then. When she gave me one\\ncold parting kiss upon my forehead, like a thaw-drop from the stone\\nporch--it was a very frosty day--I felt so miserable and\\nself-reproachful that I clung to her and told her it was my fault, I\\nknew, that she could say good-bye so easily!\\n\\n\"No, Esther!\" she returned. \"It is your misfortune!\"\\n\\nThe coach was at the little lawn-gate--we had not come out until we\\nheard the wheels--and thus I left her, with a sorrowful heart. She\\nwent in before my boxes were lifted to the coach-roof and shut the\\ndoor. As long as I could see the house, I looked back at it from the\\nwindow through my tears. My godmother had left Mrs. Rachael all the\\nlittle property she possessed; and there was to be a sale; and an old\\nhearth-rug with roses on it, which always seemed to me the first\\nthing in the world I had ever seen, was hanging outside in the frost\\nand snow. A day or two before, I had wrapped the dear old doll in her\\nown shawl and quietly laid her--I am half ashamed to tell it--in the\\ngarden-earth under the tree that shaded my old window. I had no\\ncompanion left but my bird, and him I carried with me in his cage.\\n\\nWhen the house was out of sight, I sat, with my bird-cage in the\\nstraw at my feet, forward on the low seat to look out of the high\\nwindow, watching the frosty trees, that were like beautiful pieces of\\nspar, and the fields all smooth and white with last night\\'s snow, and\\nthe sun, so red but yielding so little heat, and the ice, dark like\\nmetal where the skaters and sliders had brushed the snow away. There\\nwas a gentleman in the coach who sat on the opposite seat and looked\\nvery large in a quantity of wrappings, but he sat gazing out of the\\nother window and took no notice of me.\\n\\nI thought of my dead godmother, of the night when I read to her, of\\nher frowning so fixedly and sternly in her bed, of the strange place\\nI was going to, of the people I should find there, and what they\\nwould be like, and what they would say to me, when a voice in the\\ncoach gave me a terrible start.\\n\\nIt said, \"What the de-vil are you crying for?\"\\n\\nI was so frightened that I lost my voice and could only answer in a\\nwhisper, \"Me, sir?\" For of course I knew it must have been the\\ngentleman in the quantity of wrappings, though he was still looking\\nout of his window.\\n\\n\"Yes, you,\" he said, turning round.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know I was crying, sir,\" I faltered.\\n\\n\"But you are!\" said the gentleman. \"Look here!\" He came quite\\nopposite to me from the other corner of the coach, brushed one of his\\nlarge furry cuffs across my eyes (but without hurting me), and showed\\nme that it was wet.\\n\\n\"There! Now you know you are,\" he said. \"Don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said.\\n\\n\"And what are you crying for?\" said the gentleman, \"Don\\'t you want to\\ngo there?\"\\n\\n\"Where, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Where? Why, wherever you are going,\" said the gentleman.\\n\\n\"I am very glad to go there, sir,\" I answered.\\n\\n\"Well, then! Look glad!\" said the gentleman.\\n\\nI thought he was very strange, or at least that what I could see of\\nhim was very strange, for he was wrapped up to the chin, and his face\\nwas almost hidden in a fur cap with broad fur straps at the side of\\nhis head fastened under his chin; but I was composed again, and not\\nafraid of him. So I told him that I thought I must have been crying\\nbecause of my godmother\\'s death and because of Mrs. Rachael\\'s not\\nbeing sorry to part with me.\\n\\n\"Confound Mrs. Rachael!\" said the gentleman. \"Let her fly away in a\\nhigh wind on a broomstick!\"\\n\\nI began to be really afraid of him now and looked at him with the\\ngreatest astonishment. But I thought that he had pleasant eyes,\\nalthough he kept on muttering to himself in an angry manner and\\ncalling Mrs. Rachael names.\\n\\nAfter a little while he opened his outer wrapper, which appeared to\\nme large enough to wrap up the whole coach, and put his arm down into\\na deep pocket in the side.\\n\\n\"Now, look here!\" he said. \"In this paper,\" which was nicely folded,\\n\"is a piece of the best plum-cake that can be got for money--sugar on\\nthe outside an inch thick, like fat on mutton chops. Here\\'s a little\\npie (a gem this is, both for size and quality), made in France. And\\nwhat do you suppose it\\'s made of? Livers of fat geese. There\\'s a pie!\\nNow let\\'s see you eat \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir,\" I replied; \"thank you very much indeed, but I hope\\nyou won\\'t be offended--they are too rich for me.\"\\n\\n\"Floored again!\" said the gentleman, which I didn\\'t at all\\nunderstand, and threw them both out of window.\\n\\nHe did not speak to me any more until he got out of the coach a\\nlittle way short of Reading, when he advised me to be a good girl and\\nto be studious, and shook hands with me. I must say I was relieved by\\nhis departure. We left him at a milestone. I often walked past it\\nafterwards, and never for a long time without thinking of him and\\nhalf expecting to meet him. But I never did; and so, as time went on,\\nhe passed out of my mind.\\n\\nWhen the coach stopped, a very neat lady looked up at the window and\\nsaid, \"Miss Donny.\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, Esther Summerson.\"\\n\\n\"That is quite right,\" said the lady, \"Miss Donny.\"\\n\\nI now understood that she introduced herself by that name, and begged\\nMiss Donny\\'s pardon for my mistake, and pointed out my boxes at her\\nrequest. Under the direction of a very neat maid, they were put\\noutside a very small green carriage; and then Miss Donny, the maid,\\nand I got inside and were driven away.\\n\\n\"Everything is ready for you, Esther,\" said Miss Donny, \"and the\\nscheme of your pursuits has been arranged in exact accordance with\\nthe wishes of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Of--did you say, ma\\'am?\"\\n\\n\"Of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce,\" said Miss Donny.\\n\\nI was so bewildered that Miss Donny thought the cold had been too\\nsevere for me and lent me her smelling-bottle.\\n\\n\"Do you know my--guardian, Mr. Jarndyce, ma\\'am?\" I asked after a good\\ndeal of hesitation.\\n\\n\"Not personally, Esther,\" said Miss Donny; \"merely through his\\nsolicitors, Messrs. Kenge and Carboy, of London. A very superior\\ngentleman, Mr. Kenge. Truly eloquent indeed. Some of his periods\\nquite majestic!\"\\n\\nI felt this to be very true but was too confused to attend to it. Our\\nspeedy arrival at our destination, before I had time to recover\\nmyself, increased my confusion, and I never shall forget the\\nuncertain and the unreal air of everything at Greenleaf (Miss Donny\\'s\\nhouse) that afternoon!\\n\\nBut I soon became used to it. I was so adapted to the routine of\\nGreenleaf before long that I seemed to have been there a great while\\nand almost to have dreamed rather than really lived my old life at my\\ngodmother\\'s. Nothing could be more precise, exact, and orderly than\\nGreenleaf. There was a time for everything all round the dial of the\\nclock, and everything was done at its appointed moment.\\n\\nWe were twelve boarders, and there were two Miss Donnys, twins. It\\nwas understood that I would have to depend, by and by, on my\\nqualifications as a governess, and I was not only instructed in\\neverything that was taught at Greenleaf, but was very soon engaged in\\nhelping to instruct others. Although I was treated in every other\\nrespect like the rest of the school, this single difference was made\\nin my case from the first. As I began to know more, I taught more,\\nand so in course of time I had plenty to do, which I was very fond of\\ndoing because it made the dear girls fond of me. At last, whenever a\\nnew pupil came who was a little downcast and unhappy, she was so\\nsure--indeed I don\\'t know why--to make a friend of me that all\\nnew-comers were confided to my care. They said I was so gentle, but I\\nam sure THEY were! I often thought of the resolution I had made on my\\nbirthday to try to be industrious, contented, and true-hearted and to\\ndo some good to some one and win some love if I could; and indeed,\\nindeed, I felt almost ashamed to have done so little and have won so\\nmuch.\\n\\nI passed at Greenleaf six happy, quiet years. I never saw in any face\\nthere, thank heaven, on my birthday, that it would have been better\\nif I had never been born. When the day came round, it brought me so\\nmany tokens of affectionate remembrance that my room was beautiful\\nwith them from New Year\\'s Day to Christmas.\\n\\nIn those six years I had never been away except on visits at holiday\\ntime in the neighbourhood. After the first six months or so I had\\ntaken Miss Donny\\'s advice in reference to the propriety of writing to\\nMr. Kenge to say that I was happy and grateful, and with her approval\\nI had written such a letter. I had received a formal answer\\nacknowledging its receipt and saying, \"We note the contents thereof,\\nwhich shall be duly communicated to our client.\" After that I\\nsometimes heard Miss Donny and her sister mention how regular my\\naccounts were paid, and about twice a year I ventured to write a\\nsimilar letter. I always received by return of post exactly the same\\nanswer in the same round hand, with the signature of Kenge and Carboy\\nin another writing, which I supposed to be Mr. Kenge\\'s.\\n\\nIt seems so curious to me to be obliged to write all this about\\nmyself! As if this narrative were the narrative of MY life! But my\\nlittle body will soon fall into the background now.\\n\\nSix quiet years (I find I am saying it for the second time) I had\\npassed at Greenleaf, seeing in those around me, as it might be in a\\nlooking-glass, every stage of my own growth and change there, when,\\none November morning, I received this letter. I omit the date.\\n\\n\\n   Old Square, Lincoln\\'s Inn\\n\\n   Madam,\\n\\n   Jarndyce and Jarndyce\\n\\n   Our clt Mr. Jarndyce being abt to rece into his house,\\n   under an Order of the Ct of Chy, a Ward of the Ct in this\\n   cause, for whom he wishes to secure an elgble compn,\\n   directs us to inform you that he will be glad of your\\n   serces in the afsd capacity.\\n\\n   We have arrngd for your being forded, carriage free, pr\\n   eight o\\'clock coach from Reading, on Monday morning next,\\n   to White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly, London, where one of\\n   our clks will be in waiting to convey you to our offe as\\n   above.\\n\\n   We are, Madam, Your obedt Servts,\\n\\n   Kenge and Carboy\\n\\n   Miss Esther Summerson\\n\\n\\nOh, never, never, never shall I forget the emotion this letter caused\\nin the house! It was so tender in them to care so much for me, it was\\nso gracious in that father who had not forgotten me to have made my\\norphan way so smooth and easy and to have inclined so many youthful\\nnatures towards me, that I could hardly bear it. Not that I would\\nhave had them less sorry--I am afraid not; but the pleasure of it,\\nand the pain of it, and the pride and joy of it, and the humble\\nregret of it were so blended that my heart seemed almost breaking\\nwhile it was full of rapture.\\n\\nThe letter gave me only five days\\' notice of my removal. When every\\nminute added to the proofs of love and kindness that were given me in\\nthose five days, and when at last the morning came and when they took\\nme through all the rooms that I might see them for the last time, and\\nwhen some cried, \"Esther, dear, say good-bye to me here at my\\nbedside, where you first spoke so kindly to me!\" and when others\\nasked me only to write their names, \"With Esther\\'s love,\" and when\\nthey all surrounded me with their parting presents and clung to me\\nweeping and cried, \"What shall we do when dear, dear Esther\\'s gone!\"\\nand when I tried to tell them how forbearing and how good they had\\nall been to me and how I blessed and thanked them every one, what a\\nheart I had!\\n\\nAnd when the two Miss Donnys grieved as much to part with me as the\\nleast among them, and when the maids said, \"Bless you, miss, wherever\\nyou go!\" and when the ugly lame old gardener, who I thought had\\nhardly noticed me in all those years, came panting after the coach to\\ngive me a little nosegay of geraniums and told me I had been the\\nlight of his eyes--indeed the old man said so!--what a heart I had\\nthen!\\n\\nAnd could I help it if with all this, and the coming to the little\\nschool, and the unexpected sight of the poor children outside waving\\ntheir hats and bonnets to me, and of a grey-haired gentleman and lady\\nwhose daughter I had helped to teach and at whose house I had visited\\n(who were said to be the proudest people in all that country), caring\\nfor nothing but calling out, \"Good-bye, Esther. May you be very\\nhappy!\"--could I help it if I was quite bowed down in the coach by\\nmyself and said \"Oh, I am so thankful, I am so thankful!\" many times\\nover!\\n\\nBut of course I soon considered that I must not take tears where I\\nwas going after all that had been done for me. Therefore, of course,\\nI made myself sob less and persuaded myself to be quiet by saying\\nvery often, \"Esther, now you really must! This WILL NOT do!\" I\\ncheered myself up pretty well at last, though I am afraid I was\\nlonger about it than I ought to have been; and when I had cooled my\\neyes with lavender water, it was time to watch for London.\\n\\nI was quite persuaded that we were there when we were ten miles off,\\nand when we really were there, that we should never get there.\\nHowever, when we began to jolt upon a stone pavement, and\\nparticularly when every other conveyance seemed to be running into\\nus, and we seemed to be running into every other conveyance, I began\\nto believe that we really were approaching the end of our journey.\\nVery soon afterwards we stopped.\\n\\nA young gentleman who had inked himself by accident addressed me from\\nthe pavement and said, \"I am from Kenge and Carboy\\'s, miss, of\\nLincoln\\'s Inn.\"\\n\\n\"If you please, sir,\" said I.\\n\\nHe was very obliging, and as he handed me into a fly after\\nsuperintending the removal of my boxes, I asked him whether there was\\na great fire anywhere? For the streets were so full of dense brown\\nsmoke that scarcely anything was to be seen.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear no, miss,\" he said. \"This is a London particular.\"\\n\\nI had never heard of such a thing.\\n\\n\"A fog, miss,\" said the young gentleman.\\n\\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said I.\\n\\nWe drove slowly through the dirtiest and darkest streets that ever\\nwere seen in the world (I thought) and in such a distracting state of\\nconfusion that I wondered how the people kept their senses, until we\\npassed into sudden quietude under an old gateway and drove on through\\na silent square until we came to an odd nook in a corner, where there\\nwas an entrance up a steep, broad flight of stairs, like an entrance\\nto a church. And there really was a churchyard outside under some\\ncloisters, for I saw the gravestones from the staircase window.\\n\\nThis was Kenge and Carboy\\'s. The young gentleman showed me through an\\nouter office into Mr. Kenge\\'s room--there was no one in it--and\\npolitely put an arm-chair for me by the fire. He then called my\\nattention to a little looking-glass hanging from a nail on one side\\nof the chimney-piece.\\n\\n\"In case you should wish to look at yourself, miss, after the\\njourney, as you\\'re going before the Chancellor. Not that it\\'s\\nrequisite, I am sure,\" said the young gentleman civilly.\\n\\n\"Going before the Chancellor?\" I said, startled for a moment.\\n\\n\"Only a matter of form, miss,\" returned the young gentleman. \"Mr.\\nKenge is in court now. He left his compliments, and would you partake\\nof some refreshment\"--there were biscuits and a decanter of wine on a\\nsmall table--\"and look over the paper,\" which the young gentleman\\ngave me as he spoke. He then stirred the fire and left me.\\n\\nEverything was so strange--the stranger from its being night in the\\nday-time, the candles burning with a white flame, and looking raw and\\ncold--that I read the words in the newspaper without knowing what\\nthey meant and found myself reading the same words repeatedly. As it\\nwas of no use going on in that way, I put the paper down, took a peep\\nat my bonnet in the glass to see if it was neat, and looked at the\\nroom, which was not half lighted, and at the shabby, dusty tables,\\nand at the piles of writings, and at a bookcase full of the most\\ninexpressive-looking books that ever had anything to say for\\nthemselves. Then I went on, thinking, thinking, thinking; and the\\nfire went on, burning, burning, burning; and the candles went on\\nflickering and guttering, and there were no snuffers--until the young\\ngentleman by and by brought a very dirty pair--for two hours.\\n\\nAt last Mr. Kenge came. HE was not altered, but he was surprised to\\nsee how altered I was and appeared quite pleased. \"As you are going\\nto be the companion of the young lady who is now in the Chancellor\\'s\\nprivate room, Miss Summerson,\" he said, \"we thought it well that you\\nshould be in attendance also. You will not be discomposed by the Lord\\nChancellor, I dare say?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" I said, \"I don\\'t think I shall,\" really not seeing on\\nconsideration why I should be.\\n\\nSo Mr. Kenge gave me his arm and we went round the corner, under a\\ncolonnade, and in at a side door. And so we came, along a passage,\\ninto a comfortable sort of room where a young lady and a young\\ngentleman were standing near a great, loud-roaring fire. A screen was\\ninterposed between them and it, and they were leaning on the screen,\\ntalking.\\n\\nThey both looked up when I came in, and I saw in the young lady, with\\nthe fire shining upon her, such a beautiful girl! With such rich\\ngolden hair, such soft blue eyes, and such a bright, innocent,\\ntrusting face!\\n\\n\"Miss Ada,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"this is Miss Summerson.\"\\n\\nShe came to meet me with a smile of welcome and her hand extended,\\nbut seemed to change her mind in a moment and kissed me. In short,\\nshe had such a natural, captivating, winning manner that in a few\\nminutes we were sitting in the window-seat, with the light of the\\nfire upon us, talking together as free and happy as could be.\\n\\nWhat a load off my mind! It was so delightful to know that she could\\nconfide in me and like me! It was so good of her, and so encouraging\\nto me!\\n\\nThe young gentleman was her distant cousin, she told me, and his name\\nRichard Carstone. He was a handsome youth with an ingenuous face and\\na most engaging laugh; and after she had called him up to where we\\nsat, he stood by us, in the light of the fire, talking gaily, like a\\nlight-hearted boy. He was very young, not more than nineteen then, if\\nquite so much, but nearly two years older than she was. They were\\nboth orphans and (what was very unexpected and curious to me) had\\nnever met before that day. Our all three coming together for the\\nfirst time in such an unusual place was a thing to talk about, and we\\ntalked about it; and the fire, which had left off roaring, winked its\\nred eyes at us--as Richard said--like a drowsy old Chancery lion.\\n\\nWe conversed in a low tone because a full-dressed gentleman in a bag\\nwig frequently came in and out, and when he did so, we could hear a\\ndrawling sound in the distance, which he said was one of the counsel\\nin our case addressing the Lord Chancellor. He told Mr. Kenge that\\nthe Chancellor would be up in five minutes; and presently we heard a\\nbustle and a tread of feet, and Mr. Kenge said that the Court had\\nrisen and his lordship was in the next room.\\n\\nThe gentleman in the bag wig opened the door almost directly and\\nrequested Mr. Kenge to come in. Upon that, we all went into the next\\nroom, Mr. Kenge first, with my darling--it is so natural to me now\\nthat I can\\'t help writing it; and there, plainly dressed in black and\\nsitting in an arm-chair at a table near the fire, was his lordship,\\nwhose robe, trimmed with beautiful gold lace, was thrown upon another\\nchair. He gave us a searching look as we entered, but his manner was\\nboth courtly and kind.\\n\\nThe gentleman in the bag wig laid bundles of papers on his lordship\\'s\\ntable, and his lordship silently selected one and turned over the\\nleaves.\\n\\n\"Miss Clare,\" said the Lord Chancellor. \"Miss Ada Clare?\"\\n\\nMr. Kenge presented her, and his lordship begged her to sit down near\\nhim. That he admired her and was interested by her even I could see\\nin a moment. It touched me that the home of such a beautiful young\\ncreature should be represented by that dry, official place. The Lord\\nHigh Chancellor, at his best, appeared so poor a substitute for the\\nlove and pride of parents.\\n\\n\"The Jarndyce in question,\" said the Lord Chancellor, still turning\\nover leaves, \"is Jarndyce of Bleak House.\"\\n\\n\"Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\\n\"A dreary name,\" said the Lord Chancellor.\\n\\n\"But not a dreary place at present, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\\n\"And Bleak House,\" said his lordship, \"is in--\"\\n\\n\"Hertfordshire, my lord.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House is not married?\" said his lordship.\\n\\n\"He is not, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\\nA pause.\\n\\n\"Young Mr. Richard Carstone is present?\" said the Lord Chancellor,\\nglancing towards him.\\n\\nRichard bowed and stepped forward.\\n\\n\"Hum!\" said the Lord Chancellor, turning over more leaves.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,\" Mr. Kenge observed in a low\\nvoice, \"if I may venture to remind your lordship, provides a suitable\\ncompanion for--\"\\n\\n\"For Mr. Richard Carstone?\" I thought (but I am not quite sure) I\\nheard his lordship say in an equally low voice and with a smile.\\n\\n\"For Miss Ada Clare. This is the young lady. Miss Summerson.\"\\n\\nHis lordship gave me an indulgent look and acknowledged my curtsy\\nvery graciously.\\n\\n\"Miss Summerson is not related to any party in the cause, I think?\"\\n\\n\"No, my lord.\"\\n\\nMr. Kenge leant over before it was quite said and whispered. His\\nlordship, with his eyes upon his papers, listened, nodded twice or\\nthrice, turned over more leaves, and did not look towards me again\\nuntil we were going away.\\n\\nMr. Kenge now retired, and Richard with him, to where I was, near the\\ndoor, leaving my pet (it is so natural to me that again I can\\'t help\\nit!) sitting near the Lord Chancellor, with whom his lordship spoke a\\nlittle part, asking her, as she told me afterwards, whether she had\\nwell reflected on the proposed arrangement, and if she thought she\\nwould be happy under the roof of Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, and why\\nshe thought so? Presently he rose courteously and released her, and\\nthen he spoke for a minute or two with Richard Carstone, not seated,\\nbut standing, and altogether with more ease and less ceremony, as if\\nhe still knew, though he WAS Lord Chancellor, how to go straight to\\nthe candour of a boy.\\n\\n\"Very well!\" said his lordship aloud. \"I shall make the order. Mr.\\nJarndyce of Bleak House has chosen, so far as I may judge,\" and this\\nwas when he looked at me, \"a very good companion for the young lady,\\nand the arrangement altogether seems the best of which the\\ncircumstances admit.\"\\n\\nHe dismissed us pleasantly, and we all went out, very much obliged to\\nhim for being so affable and polite, by which he had certainly lost\\nno dignity but seemed to us to have gained some.\\n\\nWhen we got under the colonnade, Mr. Kenge remembered that he must go\\nback for a moment to ask a question and left us in the fog, with the\\nLord Chancellor\\'s carriage and servants waiting for him to come out.\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Richard Carstone. \"THAT\\'S over! And where do we go next,\\nMiss Summerson?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you know?\" I said.\\n\\n\"Not in the least,\" said he.\\n\\n\"And don\\'t YOU know, my love?\" I asked Ada.\\n\\n\"No!\" said she. \"Don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all!\" said I.\\n\\nWe looked at one another, half laughing at our being like the\\nchildren in the wood, when a curious little old woman in a squeezed\\nbonnet and carrying a reticule came curtsying and smiling up to us\\nwith an air of great ceremony.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said she. \"The wards in Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy, I am sure, to\\nhave the honour! It is a good omen for youth, and hope, and beauty\\nwhen they find themselves in this place, and don\\'t know what\\'s to\\ncome of it.\"\\n\\n\"Mad!\" whispered Richard, not thinking she could hear him.\\n\\n\"Right! Mad, young gentleman,\" she returned so quickly that he was\\nquite abashed. \"I was a ward myself. I was not mad at that time,\"\\ncurtsying low and smiling between every little sentence. \"I had youth\\nand hope. I believe, beauty. It matters very little now. Neither of\\nthe three served or saved me. I have the honour to attend court\\nregularly. With my documents. I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the\\nDay of Judgment. I have discovered that the sixth seal mentioned in\\nthe Revelations is the Great Seal. It has been open a long time! Pray\\naccept my blessing.\"\\n\\nAs Ada was a little frightened, I said, to humour the poor old lady,\\nthat we were much obliged to her.\\n\\n\"Ye-es!\" she said mincingly. \"I imagine so. And here is Conversation\\nKenge. With HIS documents! How does your honourable worship do?\"\\n\\n\"Quite well, quite well! Now don\\'t be troublesome, that\\'s a good\\nsoul!\" said Mr. Kenge, leading the way back.\\n\\n\"By no means,\" said the poor old lady, keeping up with Ada and me.\\n\"Anything but troublesome. I shall confer estates on both--which is\\nnot being troublesome, I trust? I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the\\nDay of Judgment. This is a good omen for you. Accept my blessing!\"\\n\\nShe stopped at the bottom of the steep, broad flight of stairs; but\\nwe looked back as we went up, and she was still there, saying, still\\nwith a curtsy and a smile between every little sentence, \"Youth. And\\nhope. And beauty. And Chancery. And Conversation Kenge! Ha! Pray\\naccept my blessing!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWe were to pass the night, Mr. Kenge told us when we arrived in his\\nroom, at Mrs. Jellyby\\'s; and then he turned to me and said he took it\\nfor granted I knew who Mrs. Jellyby was.\\n\\n\"I really don\\'t, sir,\" I returned. \"Perhaps Mr. Carstone--or Miss\\nClare--\"\\n\\nBut no, they knew nothing whatever about Mrs. Jellyby. \"In-deed! Mrs.\\nJellyby,\" said Mr. Kenge, standing with his back to the fire and\\ncasting his eyes over the dusty hearth-rug as if it were Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s biography, \"is a lady of very remarkable strength of\\ncharacter who devotes herself entirely to the public. She has devoted\\nherself to an extensive variety of public subjects at various times\\nand is at present (until something else attracts her) devoted to the\\nsubject of Africa, with a view to the general cultivation of the\\ncoffee berry--AND the natives--and the happy settlement, on the banks\\nof the African rivers, of our superabundant home population. Mr.\\nJarndyce, who is desirous to aid any work that is considered likely\\nto be a good work and who is much sought after by philanthropists,\\nhas, I believe, a very high opinion of Mrs. Jellyby.\"\\n\\nMr. Kenge, adjusting his cravat, then looked at us.\\n\\n\"And Mr. Jellyby, sir?\" suggested Richard.\\n\\n\"Ah! Mr. Jellyby,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"is--a--I don\\'t know that I can\\ndescribe him to you better than by saying that he is the husband of\\nMrs. Jellyby.\"\\n\\n\"A nonentity, sir?\" said Richard with a droll look.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t say that,\" returned Mr. Kenge gravely. \"I can\\'t say that,\\nindeed, for I know nothing whatever OF Mr. Jellyby. I never, to my\\nknowledge, had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jellyby. He may be a very\\nsuperior man, but he is, so to speak, merged--merged--in the more\\nshining qualities of his wife.\" Mr. Kenge proceeded to tell us that\\nas the road to Bleak House would have been very long, dark, and\\ntedious on such an evening, and as we had been travelling already,\\nMr. Jarndyce had himself proposed this arrangement. A carriage would\\nbe at Mrs. Jellyby\\'s to convey us out of town early in the forenoon\\nof to-morrow.\\n\\nHe then rang a little bell, and the young gentleman came in.\\nAddressing him by the name of Guppy, Mr. Kenge inquired whether Miss\\nSummerson\\'s boxes and the rest of the baggage had been \"sent round.\"\\nMr. Guppy said yes, they had been sent round, and a coach was waiting\\nto take us round too as soon as we pleased.\\n\\n\"Then it only remains,\" said Mr. Kenge, shaking hands with us, \"for\\nme to express my lively satisfaction in (good day, Miss Clare!) the\\narrangement this day concluded and my (GOOD-bye to you, Miss\\nSummerson!) lively hope that it will conduce to the happiness, the\\n(glad to have had the honour of making your acquaintance, Mr.\\nCarstone!) welfare, the advantage in all points of view, of all\\nconcerned! Guppy, see the party safely there.\"\\n\\n\"Where IS \\'there,\\' Mr. Guppy?\" said Richard as we went downstairs.\\n\\n\"No distance,\" said Mr. Guppy; \"round in Thavies Inn, you know.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t say I know where it is, for I come from Winchester and am\\nstrange in London.\"\\n\\n\"Only round the corner,\" said Mr. Guppy. \"We just twist up Chancery\\nLane, and cut along Holborn, and there we are in four minutes\\' time,\\nas near as a toucher. This is about a London particular NOW, ain\\'t\\nit, miss?\" He seemed quite delighted with it on my account.\\n\\n\"The fog is very dense indeed!\" said I.\\n\\n\"Not that it affects you, though, I\\'m sure,\" said Mr. Guppy, putting\\nup the steps. \"On the contrary, it seems to do you good, miss,\\njudging from your appearance.\"\\n\\nI knew he meant well in paying me this compliment, so I laughed at\\nmyself for blushing at it when he had shut the door and got upon the\\nbox; and we all three laughed and chatted about our inexperience and\\nthe strangeness of London until we turned up under an archway to our\\ndestination--a narrow street of high houses like an oblong cistern to\\nhold the fog. There was a confused little crowd of people,\\nprincipally children, gathered about the house at which we stopped,\\nwhich had a tarnished brass plate on the door with the inscription\\nJELLYBY.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be frightened!\" said Mr. Guppy, looking in at the\\ncoach-window. \"One of the young Jellybys been and got his head\\nthrough the area railings!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, poor child,\" said I; \"let me out, if you please!\"\\n\\n\"Pray be careful of yourself, miss. The young Jellybys are always up\\nto something,\" said Mr. Guppy.\\n\\nI made my way to the poor child, who was one of the dirtiest little\\nunfortunates I ever saw, and found him very hot and frightened and\\ncrying loudly, fixed by the neck between two iron railings, while a\\nmilkman and a beadle, with the kindest intentions possible, were\\nendeavouring to drag him back by the legs, under a general impression\\nthat his skull was compressible by those means. As I found (after\\npacifying him) that he was a little boy with a naturally large head,\\nI thought that perhaps where his head could go, his body could\\nfollow, and mentioned that the best mode of extrication might be to\\npush him forward. This was so favourably received by the milkman and\\nbeadle that he would immediately have been pushed into the area if I\\nhad not held his pinafore while Richard and Mr. Guppy ran down\\nthrough the kitchen to catch him when he should be released. At last\\nhe was happily got down without any accident, and then he began to\\nbeat Mr. Guppy with a hoop-stick in quite a frantic manner.\\n\\nNobody had appeared belonging to the house except a person in\\npattens, who had been poking at the child from below with a broom; I\\ndon\\'t know with what object, and I don\\'t think she did. I therefore\\nsupposed that Mrs. Jellyby was not at home, and was quite surprised\\nwhen the person appeared in the passage without the pattens, and\\ngoing up to the back room on the first floor before Ada and me,\\nannounced us as, \"Them two young ladies, Missis Jellyby!\" We passed\\nseveral more children on the way up, whom it was difficult to avoid\\ntreading on in the dark; and as we came into Mrs. Jellyby\\'s presence,\\none of the poor little things fell downstairs--down a whole flight\\n(as it sounded to me), with a great noise.\\n\\nMrs. Jellyby, whose face reflected none of the uneasiness which we\\ncould not help showing in our own faces as the dear child\\'s head\\nrecorded its passage with a bump on every stair--Richard afterwards\\nsaid he counted seven, besides one for the landing--received us with\\nperfect equanimity. She was a pretty, very diminutive, plump woman of\\nfrom forty to fifty, with handsome eyes, though they had a curious\\nhabit of seeming to look a long way off. As if--I am quoting Richard\\nagain--they could see nothing nearer than Africa!\\n\\n\"I am very glad indeed,\" said Mrs. Jellyby in an agreeable voice, \"to\\nhave the pleasure of receiving you. I have a great respect for Mr.\\nJarndyce, and no one in whom he is interested can be an object of\\nindifference to me.\"\\n\\nWe expressed our acknowledgments and sat down behind the door, where\\nthere was a lame invalid of a sofa. Mrs. Jellyby had very good hair\\nbut was too much occupied with her African duties to brush it. The\\nshawl in which she had been loosely muffled dropped onto her chair\\nwhen she advanced to us; and as she turned to resume her seat, we\\ncould not help noticing that her dress didn\\'t nearly meet up the back\\nand that the open space was railed across with a lattice-work of\\nstay-lace--like a summer-house.\\n\\nThe room, which was strewn with papers and nearly filled by a great\\nwriting-table covered with similar litter, was, I must say, not only\\nvery untidy but very dirty. We were obliged to take notice of that\\nwith our sense of sight, even while, with our sense of hearing, we\\nfollowed the poor child who had tumbled downstairs: I think into the\\nback kitchen, where somebody seemed to stifle him.\\n\\nBut what principally struck us was a jaded and unhealthy-looking\\nthough by no means plain girl at the writing-table, who sat biting\\nthe feather of her pen and staring at us. I suppose nobody ever was\\nin such a state of ink. And from her tumbled hair to her pretty feet,\\nwhich were disfigured with frayed and broken satin slippers trodden\\ndown at heel, she really seemed to have no article of dress upon her,\\nfrom a pin upwards, that was in its proper condition or its right\\nplace.\\n\\n\"You find me, my dears,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, snuffing the two great\\noffice candles in tin candlesticks, which made the room taste\\nstrongly of hot tallow (the fire had gone out, and there was nothing\\nin the grate but ashes, a bundle of wood, and a poker), \"you find me,\\nmy dears, as usual, very busy; but that you will excuse. The African\\nproject at present employs my whole time. It involves me in\\ncorrespondence with public bodies and with private individuals\\nanxious for the welfare of their species all over the country. I am\\nhappy to say it is advancing. We hope by this time next year to have\\nfrom a hundred and fifty to two hundred healthy families cultivating\\ncoffee and educating the natives of Borrioboola-Gha, on the left bank\\nof the Niger.\"\\n\\nAs Ada said nothing, but looked at me, I said it must be very\\ngratifying.\\n\\n\"It IS gratifying,\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"It involves the devotion of\\nall my energies, such as they are; but that is nothing, so that it\\nsucceeds; and I am more confident of success every day. Do you know,\\nMiss Summerson, I almost wonder that YOU never turned your thoughts\\nto Africa.\"\\n\\nThis application of the subject was really so unexpected to me that I\\nwas quite at a loss how to receive it. I hinted that the climate--\\n\\n\"The finest climate in the world!\" said Mrs. Jellyby.\\n\\n\"Indeed, ma\\'am?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. With precaution,\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"You may go into\\nHolborn, without precaution, and be run over. You may go into\\nHolborn, with precaution, and never be run over. Just so with\\nAfrica.\"\\n\\nI said, \"No doubt.\" I meant as to Holborn.\\n\\n\"If you would like,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, putting a number of papers\\ntowards us, \"to look over some remarks on that head, and on the\\ngeneral subject, which have been extensively circulated, while I\\nfinish a letter I am now dictating to my eldest daughter, who is my\\namanuensis--\"\\n\\nThe girl at the table left off biting her pen and made a return to\\nour recognition, which was half bashful and half sulky.\\n\\n\"--I shall then have finished for the present,\" proceeded Mrs.\\nJellyby with a sweet smile, \"though my work is never done. Where are\\nyou, Caddy?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Presents her compliments to Mr. Swallow, and begs--\\'\" said Caddy.\\n\\n\"\\'And begs,\\'\" said Mrs. Jellyby, dictating, \"\\'to inform him, in\\nreference to his letter of inquiry on the African project--\\' No,\\nPeepy! Not on my account!\"\\n\\nPeepy (so self-named) was the unfortunate child who had fallen\\ndownstairs, who now interrupted the correspondence by presenting\\nhimself, with a strip of plaster on his forehead, to exhibit his\\nwounded knees, in which Ada and I did not know which to pity\\nmost--the bruises or the dirt. Mrs. Jellyby merely added, with the\\nserene composure with which she said everything, \"Go along, you\\nnaughty Peepy!\" and fixed her fine eyes on Africa again.\\n\\nHowever, as she at once proceeded with her dictation, and as I\\ninterrupted nothing by doing it, I ventured quietly to stop poor\\nPeepy as he was going out and to take him up to nurse. He looked very\\nmuch astonished at it and at Ada\\'s kissing him, but soon fell fast\\nasleep in my arms, sobbing at longer and longer intervals, until he\\nwas quiet. I was so occupied with Peepy that I lost the letter in\\ndetail, though I derived such a general impression from it of the\\nmomentous importance of Africa, and the utter insignificance of all\\nother places and things, that I felt quite ashamed to have thought so\\nlittle about it.\\n\\n\"Six o\\'clock!\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"And our dinner hour is nominally\\n(for we dine at all hours) five! Caddy, show Miss Clare and Miss\\nSummerson their rooms. You will like to make some change, perhaps?\\nYou will excuse me, I know, being so much occupied. Oh, that very bad\\nchild! Pray put him down, Miss Summerson!\"\\n\\nI begged permission to retain him, truly saying that he was not at\\nall troublesome, and carried him upstairs and laid him on my bed. Ada\\nand I had two upper rooms with a door of communication between. They\\nwere excessively bare and disorderly, and the curtain to my window\\nwas fastened up with a fork.\\n\\n\"You would like some hot water, wouldn\\'t you?\" said Miss Jellyby,\\nlooking round for a jug with a handle to it, but looking in vain.\\n\\n\"If it is not being troublesome,\" said we.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s not the trouble,\" returned Miss Jellyby; \"the question is,\\nif there IS any.\"\\n\\nThe evening was so very cold and the rooms had such a marshy smell\\nthat I must confess it was a little miserable, and Ada was half\\ncrying. We soon laughed, however, and were busily unpacking when Miss\\nJellyby came back to say that she was sorry there was no hot water,\\nbut they couldn\\'t find the kettle, and the boiler was out of order.\\n\\nWe begged her not to mention it and made all the haste we could to\\nget down to the fire again. But all the little children had come up\\nto the landing outside to look at the phenomenon of Peepy lying on my\\nbed, and our attention was distracted by the constant apparition of\\nnoses and fingers in situations of danger between the hinges of the\\ndoors. It was impossible to shut the door of either room, for my\\nlock, with no knob to it, looked as if it wanted to be wound up; and\\nthough the handle of Ada\\'s went round and round with the greatest\\nsmoothness, it was attended with no effect whatever on the door.\\nTherefore I proposed to the children that they should come in and be\\nvery good at my table, and I would tell them the story of Little Red\\nRiding Hood while I dressed; which they did, and were as quiet as\\nmice, including Peepy, who awoke opportunely before the appearance of\\nthe wolf.\\n\\nWhen we went downstairs we found a mug with \"A Present from Tunbridge\\nWells\" on it lighted up in the staircase window with a floating wick,\\nand a young woman, with a swelled face bound up in a flannel bandage\\nblowing the fire of the drawing-room (now connected by an open door\\nwith Mrs. Jellyby\\'s room) and choking dreadfully. It smoked to that\\ndegree, in short, that we all sat coughing and crying with the\\nwindows open for half an hour, during which Mrs. Jellyby, with the\\nsame sweetness of temper, directed letters about Africa. Her being so\\nemployed was, I must say, a great relief to me, for Richard told us\\nthat he had washed his hands in a pie-dish and that they had found\\nthe kettle on his dressing-table, and he made Ada laugh so that they\\nmade me laugh in the most ridiculous manner.\\n\\nSoon after seven o\\'clock we went down to dinner, carefully, by Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s advice, for the stair-carpets, besides being very deficient\\nin stair-wires, were so torn as to be absolute traps. We had a fine\\ncod-fish, a piece of roast beef, a dish of cutlets, and a pudding; an\\nexcellent dinner, if it had had any cooking to speak of, but it was\\nalmost raw. The young woman with the flannel bandage waited, and\\ndropped everything on the table wherever it happened to go, and never\\nmoved it again until she put it on the stairs. The person I had seen\\nin pattens, who I suppose to have been the cook, frequently came and\\nskirmished with her at the door, and there appeared to be ill will\\nbetween them.\\n\\nAll through dinner--which was long, in consequence of such accidents\\nas the dish of potatoes being mislaid in the coal skuttle and the\\nhandle of the corkscrew coming off and striking the young woman in\\nthe chin--Mrs. Jellyby preserved the evenness of her disposition. She\\ntold us a great deal that was interesting about Borrioboola-Gha and\\nthe natives, and received so many letters that Richard, who sat by\\nher, saw four envelopes in the gravy at once. Some of the letters\\nwere proceedings of ladies\\' committees or resolutions of ladies\\'\\nmeetings, which she read to us; others were applications from people\\nexcited in various ways about the cultivation of coffee, and natives;\\nothers required answers, and these she sent her eldest daughter from\\nthe table three or four times to write. She was full of business and\\nundoubtedly was, as she had told us, devoted to the cause.\\n\\nI was a little curious to know who a mild bald gentleman in\\nspectacles was, who dropped into a vacant chair (there was no top or\\nbottom in particular) after the fish was taken away and seemed\\npassively to submit himself to Borrioboola-Gha but not to be actively\\ninterested in that settlement. As he never spoke a word, he might\\nhave been a native but for his complexion. It was not until we left\\nthe table and he remained alone with Richard that the possibility of\\nhis being Mr. Jellyby ever entered my head. But he WAS Mr. Jellyby;\\nand a loquacious young man called Mr. Quale, with large shining knobs\\nfor temples and his hair all brushed to the back of his head, who\\ncame in the evening, and told Ada he was a philanthropist, also\\ninformed her that he called the matrimonial alliance of Mrs. Jellyby\\nwith Mr. Jellyby the union of mind and matter.\\n\\nThis young man, besides having a great deal to say for himself about\\nAfrica and a project of his for teaching the coffee colonists to\\nteach the natives to turn piano-forte legs and establish an export\\ntrade, delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby out by saying, \"I believe\\nnow, Mrs. Jellyby, you have received as many as from one hundred and\\nfifty to two hundred letters respecting Africa in a single day, have\\nyou not?\" or, \"If my memory does not deceive me, Mrs. Jellyby, you\\nonce mentioned that you had sent off five thousand circulars from one\\npost-office at one time?\"--always repeating Mrs. Jellyby\\'s answer to\\nus like an interpreter. During the whole evening, Mr. Jellyby sat in\\na corner with his head against the wall as if he were subject to low\\nspirits. It seemed that he had several times opened his mouth when\\nalone with Richard after dinner, as if he had something on his mind,\\nbut had always shut it again, to Richard\\'s extreme confusion, without\\nsaying anything.\\n\\nMrs. Jellyby, sitting in quite a nest of waste paper, drank coffee\\nall the evening and dictated at intervals to her eldest daughter. She\\nalso held a discussion with Mr. Quale, of which the subject seemed to\\nbe--if I understood it--the brotherhood of humanity, and gave\\nutterance to some beautiful sentiments. I was not so attentive an\\nauditor as I might have wished to be, however, for Peepy and the\\nother children came flocking about Ada and me in a corner of the\\ndrawing-room to ask for another story; so we sat down among them and\\ntold them in whispers \"Puss in Boots\" and I don\\'t know what else\\nuntil Mrs. Jellyby, accidentally remembering them, sent them to bed.\\nAs Peepy cried for me to take him to bed, I carried him upstairs,\\nwhere the young woman with the flannel bandage charged into the midst\\nof the little family like a dragon and overturned them into cribs.\\n\\nAfter that I occupied myself in making our room a little tidy and in\\ncoaxing a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn, which at\\nlast it did, quite brightly. On my return downstairs, I felt that\\nMrs. Jellyby looked down upon me rather for being so frivolous, and I\\nwas sorry for it, though at the same time I knew that I had no higher\\npretensions.\\n\\nIt was nearly midnight before we found an opportunity of going to\\nbed, and even then we left Mrs. Jellyby among her papers drinking\\ncoffee and Miss Jellyby biting the feather of her pen.\\n\\n\"What a strange house!\" said Ada when we got upstairs. \"How curious\\nof my cousin Jarndyce to send us here!\"\\n\\n\"My love,\" said I, \"it quite confuses me. I want to understand it,\\nand I can\\'t understand it at all.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" asked Ada with her pretty smile.\\n\\n\"All this, my dear,\" said I. \"It MUST be very good of Mrs. Jellyby to\\ntake such pains about a scheme for the benefit of natives--and\\nyet--Peepy and the housekeeping!\"\\n\\nAda laughed and put her arm about my neck as I stood looking at the\\nfire, and told me I was a quiet, dear, good creature and had won her\\nheart. \"You are so thoughtful, Esther,\" she said, \"and yet so\\ncheerful! And you do so much, so unpretendingly! You would make a\\nhome out of even this house.\"\\n\\nMy simple darling! She was quite unconscious that she only praised\\nherself and that it was in the goodness of her own heart that she\\nmade so much of me!\\n\\n\"May I ask you a question?\" said I when we had sat before the fire a\\nlittle while.\\n\\n\"Five hundred,\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"Your cousin, Mr. Jarndyce. I owe so much to him. Would you mind\\ndescribing him to me?\"\\n\\nShaking her golden hair, Ada turned her eyes upon me with such\\nlaughing wonder that I was full of wonder too, partly at her beauty,\\npartly at her surprise.\\n\\n\"Esther!\" she cried.\\n\\n\"My dear!\"\\n\\n\"You want a description of my cousin Jarndyce?\"\\n\\n\"My dear, I never saw him.\"\\n\\n\"And I never saw him!\" returned Ada.\\n\\nWell, to be sure!\\n\\nNo, she had never seen him. Young as she was when her mama died, she\\nremembered how the tears would come into her eyes when she spoke of\\nhim and of the noble generosity of his character, which she had said\\nwas to be trusted above all earthly things; and Ada trusted it. Her\\ncousin Jarndyce had written to her a few months ago--\"a plain, honest\\nletter,\" Ada said--proposing the arrangement we were now to enter on\\nand telling her that \"in time it might heal some of the wounds made\\nby the miserable Chancery suit.\" She had replied, gratefully\\naccepting his proposal. Richard had received a similar letter and had\\nmade a similar response. He HAD seen Mr. Jarndyce once, but only\\nonce, five years ago, at Winchester school. He had told Ada, when\\nthey were leaning on the screen before the fire where I found them,\\nthat he recollected him as \"a bluff, rosy fellow.\" This was the\\nutmost description Ada could give me.\\n\\nIt set me thinking so that when Ada was asleep, I still remained\\nbefore the fire, wondering and wondering about Bleak House, and\\nwondering and wondering that yesterday morning should seem so long\\nago. I don\\'t know where my thoughts had wandered when they were\\nrecalled by a tap at the door.\\n\\nI opened it softly and found Miss Jellyby shivering there with a\\nbroken candle in a broken candlestick in one hand and an egg-cup in\\nthe other.\\n\\n\"Good night!\" she said very sulkily.\\n\\n\"Good night!\" said I.\\n\\n\"May I come in?\" she shortly and unexpectedly asked me in the same\\nsulky way.\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said I. \"Don\\'t wake Miss Clare.\"\\n\\nShe would not sit down, but stood by the fire dipping her inky middle\\nfinger in the egg-cup, which contained vinegar, and smearing it over\\nthe ink stains on her face, frowning the whole time and looking very\\ngloomy.\\n\\n\"I wish Africa was dead!\" she said on a sudden.\\n\\nI was going to remonstrate.\\n\\n\"I do!\" she said \"Don\\'t talk to me, Miss Summerson. I hate it and\\ndetest it. It\\'s a beast!\"\\n\\nI told her she was tired, and I was sorry. I put my hand upon her\\nhead, and touched her forehead, and said it was hot now but would be\\ncool to-morrow. She still stood pouting and frowning at me, but\\npresently put down her egg-cup and turned softly towards the bed\\nwhere Ada lay.\\n\\n\"She is very pretty!\" she said with the same knitted brow and in the\\nsame uncivil manner.\\n\\nI assented with a smile.\\n\\n\"An orphan. Ain\\'t she?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"But knows a quantity, I suppose? Can dance, and play music, and\\nsing? She can talk French, I suppose, and do geography, and globes,\\nand needlework, and everything?\"\\n\\n\"No doubt,\" said I.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t,\" she returned. \"I can\\'t do anything hardly, except write.\\nI\\'m always writing for Ma. I wonder you two were not ashamed of\\nyourselves to come in this afternoon and see me able to do nothing\\nelse. It was like your ill nature. Yet you think yourselves very\\nfine, I dare say!\"\\n\\nI could see that the poor girl was near crying, and I resumed my\\nchair without speaking and looked at her (I hope) as mildly as I felt\\ntowards her.\\n\\n\"It\\'s disgraceful,\" she said. \"You know it is. The whole house is\\ndisgraceful. The children are disgraceful. I\\'M disgraceful. Pa\\'s\\nmiserable, and no wonder! Priscilla drinks--she\\'s always drinking.\\nIt\\'s a great shame and a great story of you if you say you didn\\'t\\nsmell her to-day. It was as bad as a public-house, waiting at dinner;\\nyou know it was!\"\\n\\n\"My dear, I don\\'t know it,\" said I.\\n\\n\"You do,\" she said very shortly. \"You shan\\'t say you don\\'t. You do!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear!\" said I. \"If you won\\'t let me speak--\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re speaking now. You know you are. Don\\'t tell stories, Miss\\nSummerson.\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" said I, \"as long as you won\\'t hear me out--\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to hear you out.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I think you do,\" said I, \"because that would be so very\\nunreasonable. I did not know what you tell me because the servant did\\nnot come near me at dinner; but I don\\'t doubt what you tell me, and I\\nam sorry to hear it.\"\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t make a merit of that,\" said she.\\n\\n\"No, my dear,\" said I. \"That would be very foolish.\"\\n\\nShe was still standing by the bed, and now stooped down (but still\\nwith the same discontented face) and kissed Ada. That done, she came\\nsoftly back and stood by the side of my chair. Her bosom was heaving\\nin a distressful manner that I greatly pitied, but I thought it\\nbetter not to speak.\\n\\n\"I wish I was dead!\" she broke out. \"I wish we were all dead. It\\nwould be a great deal better for us.\"\\n\\nIn a moment afterwards, she knelt on the ground at my side, hid her\\nface in my dress, passionately begged my pardon, and wept. I\\ncomforted her and would have raised her, but she cried no, no; she\\nwanted to stay there!\\n\\n\"You used to teach girls,\" she said, \"If you could only have taught\\nme, I could have learnt from you! I am so very miserable, and I like\\nyou so much!\"\\n\\nI could not persuade her to sit by me or to do anything but move a\\nragged stool to where she was kneeling, and take that, and still hold\\nmy dress in the same manner. By degrees the poor tired girl fell\\nasleep, and then I contrived to raise her head so that it should rest\\non my lap, and to cover us both with shawls. The fire went out, and\\nall night long she slumbered thus before the ashy grate. At first I\\nwas painfully awake and vainly tried to lose myself, with my eyes\\nclosed, among the scenes of the day. At length, by slow degrees, they\\nbecame indistinct and mingled. I began to lose the identity of the\\nsleeper resting on me. Now it was Ada, now one of my old Reading\\nfriends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted. Now\\nit was the little mad woman worn out with curtsying and smiling, now\\nsome one in authority at Bleak House. Lastly, it was no one, and I\\nwas no one.\\n\\nThe purblind day was feebly struggling with the fog when I opened my\\neyes to encounter those of a dirty-faced little spectre fixed upon\\nme. Peepy had scaled his crib, and crept down in his bed-gown and\\ncap, and was so cold that his teeth were chattering as if he had cut\\nthem all.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'model_output': \"Esther Summerson was raised by her stern godmother and knew little of her own background. On her birthdays, her godmother would tell her that her mother was her disgrace and that she must pray to avoid inheriting her mother's sins. This made Esther feel guilty, as she was born out of wedlock and never knew her father. Her godmother constantly implied Esther should feel ashamed about her illegitimate birth, though Esther resolved to try to be good-hearted and do some good in the world. After her godmother died suddenly while reading the Bible to Esther, Mr. Kenge revealed that Esther may have a claim as an unknown heir in the complex Jarndyce v Jarndyce case regarding an inheritance that had been dragging on for generations in the Court of Chancery. Her mother had been involved in the disputed inheritance case but died shortly after Esther's birth.  \\n\\nMr. Kenge arranged for Esther to become a companion to Ada Clare, a young ward also connected to the Jarndyce case. Esther traveled by coach from her home in Windsor to London, where she met Ada and her cousin Richard Carstone. The three of them were brought before the Lord Chancellor, who questioned their connection to the disputed inheritance case. It seemed Ada and Richard would become wards in the suit as they also stood to inherit from the estate. That night, they stayed at the chaotic home of Mrs. Jellyby, who was obsessed with her philanthropic work while neglecting her own children. Esther helped care for the injured child Peepy while Mrs. Jellyby dictated letters about her African charity projects.\\n\\nThe next day, Esther, Ada, and Richard were to travel to Bleak House, though none of them had ever met the generous Mr. Jarndyce, who was to be their guardian. Richard vaguely recalled Mr. Jarndyce as a rosy, bluff man from a brief childhood encounter. As Esther tried to sleep that night, Caddy Jellyby came to her room in tears, complaining of her duties to her neglectful mother before falling asleep with her head in Esther's lap. In the morning, little Peepy startled Esther by chattering his teeth and climbing out of his crib before their departure.\"}]\n"

      "[{'summary': 'Tulkinghorn and Krook find Nemo dead, apparently from an overdose of opium. Krook claims no knowledge of Mr. Nemo\\'s identity or habits, and is chagrined because Nemo owes him six weeks\\' rent. Dr. Woodcourt (though he is not named immediately) arrives on the scene and reveals that Nemo has bought opium from him for a year and a half. Tulkinghorn learns from the ragamuffin Jo, a crossing-sweeper, that Nemo was a kind man, and gave Jo money when he had it. \"He wos wery good to me, he wos!\"\\n\\nAn inquest is held regarding Nemo\\'s death, a silly proceeding in a tavern complete with a comic vocalist, and he is officially found dead by accident. Since Nemo had no money or family, he is buried in a pauper\\'s grave.\\n\\nIn Chapter 12, the scene returns to Chesney Wold. The Dedlocks have returned, and have guests. Meanwhile Lady Dedlock continues to suffer ennui. Lady Dedlock meets the young maid Rosa for the first time, and takes a liking to her. This causes jealousy to arise in Lady Dedlock\\'s personal lady\\'s maid, Mademoiselle Hortense.\\n\\nTulkinghorn comes to Chesney Wold to inform Sir Leicester of the lawsuit brought upon him by his neighbor Boythorn. Tulkinghorn also has a message for Lady Dedlock concerning Nemo, whose handwriting was on the paper she had such interest in the last time he was at Chesney Wold, and tells of the law writer\\'s death. She pretends that the death doesn\\'t especially concern her; Tulkinghorn, unfooled, sees otherwise. The rest of the visit Lady Dedlock and Tulkinghorn watch each other carefully and surreptitiously.\\n\\nIn Chapter 13 Richard\\'s future is under futher discussion. His education has been soley the Classics (meaning, in those days, ancient Latin and Greek literature). Richard knows nothing about what he would like to do, except that he doesn\\'t want to become a minister in the Church of England. Mr. Jarndyce suggest the medical profession, and Richard quickly (too quickly) seizes upon the idea.\\n\\nMr. Boythorn -- along with Mr. Kenge, who is also present -- is enthusiastic about Richard\\'s proposed medical career and propounds the maltreatment of doctors aboard Navy ships. The men discuss how Richard is to be gotten into the profession, and Mr. Kenge plans for his cousin, Dr. Bayham Badger, to take Richard as an apprentice.\\n\\nAs Mr. Badger lives in London, the party goes to London a few weeks later to get Richard settled. In London, Esther attends the theatre and is followed and stared at by the lovestruck Mr. Guppy. Ada and Richard\\'s romance continues to blossom.\\n\\nAt Mr. Badger\\'s house the party meets Dr. Allan Woodcourt, and Esther finds him attractive. The talk at the Badgers\\' is of an unconventional kind -- namely the wealth and prestige of Mrs. Badgers two deceased husbands. Esther tells Mr. Jarndyce that Ada and Richard are in love, but he advises the lovers that because they are too young, and because Richard is not yet established, they should wait to be married. ', 'text': 'A touch on the lawyer\\'s wrinkled hand as he stands in the dark room,\\nirresolute, makes him start and say, \"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s me,\" returns the old man of the house, whose breath is in his\\near. \"Can\\'t you wake him?\"\\n\\n\"No.\"\\n\\n\"What have you done with your candle?\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s gone out. Here it is.\"\\n\\nKrook takes it, goes to the fire, stoops over the red embers, and\\ntries to get a light. The dying ashes have no light to spare, and his\\nendeavours are vain. Muttering, after an ineffectual call to his\\nlodger, that he will go downstairs and bring a lighted candle from\\nthe shop, the old man departs. Mr. Tulkinghorn, for some new reason\\nthat he has, does not await his return in the room, but on the stairs\\noutside.\\n\\nThe welcome light soon shines upon the wall, as Krook comes slowly up\\nwith his green-eyed cat following at his heels. \"Does the man\\ngenerally sleep like this?\" inquired the lawyer in a low voice. \"Hi!\\nI don\\'t know,\" says Krook, shaking his head and lifting his eyebrows.\\n\"I know next to nothing of his habits except that he keeps himself\\nvery close.\"\\n\\nThus whispering, they both go in together. As the light goes in, the\\ngreat eyes in the shutters, darkening, seem to close. Not so the eyes\\nupon the bed.\\n\\n\"God save us!\" exclaims Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"He is dead!\" Krook drops\\nthe heavy hand he has taken up so suddenly that the arm swings over\\nthe bedside.\\n\\nThey look at one another for a moment.\\n\\n\"Send for some doctor! Call for Miss Flite up the stairs, sir. Here\\'s\\npoison by the bed! Call out for Flite, will you?\" says Krook, with\\nhis lean hands spread out above the body like a vampire\\'s wings.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn hurries to the landing and calls, \"Miss Flite! Flite!\\nMake haste, here, whoever you are! Flite!\" Krook follows him with his\\neyes, and while he is calling, finds opportunity to steal to the old\\nportmanteau and steal back again.\\n\\n\"Run, Flite, run! The nearest doctor! Run!\" So Mr. Krook addresses a\\ncrazy little woman who is his female lodger, who appears and vanishes\\nin a breath, who soon returns accompanied by a testy medical man\\nbrought from his dinner, with a broad, snuffy upper lip and a broad\\nScotch tongue.\\n\\n\"Ey! Bless the hearts o\\' ye,\" says the medical man, looking up at\\nthem after a moment\\'s examination. \"He\\'s just as dead as Phairy!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn (standing by the old portmanteau) inquires if he has\\nbeen dead any time.\\n\\n\"Any time, sir?\" says the medical gentleman. \"It\\'s probable he wull\\nhave been dead aboot three hours.\"\\n\\n\"About that time, I should say,\" observes a dark young man on the\\nother side of the bed.\\n\\n\"Air you in the maydickle prayfession yourself, sir?\" inquires the\\nfirst.\\n\\nThe dark young man says yes.\\n\\n\"Then I\\'ll just tak\\' my depairture,\" replies the other, \"for I\\'m nae\\ngude here!\" With which remark he finishes his brief attendance and\\nreturns to finish his dinner.\\n\\nThe dark young surgeon passes the candle across and across the face\\nand carefully examines the law-writer, who has established his\\npretensions to his name by becoming indeed No one.\\n\\n\"I knew this person by sight very well,\" says he. \"He has purchased\\nopium of me for the last year and a half. Was anybody present related\\nto him?\" glancing round upon the three bystanders.\\n\\n\"I was his landlord,\" grimly answers Krook, taking the candle from\\nthe surgeon\\'s outstretched hand. \"He told me once I was the nearest\\nrelation he had.\"\\n\\n\"He has died,\" says the surgeon, \"of an over-dose of opium, there is\\nno doubt. The room is strongly flavoured with it. There is enough\\nhere now,\" taking an old tea-pot from Mr. Krook, \"to kill a dozen\\npeople.\"\\n\\n\"Do you think he did it on purpose?\" asks Krook.\\n\\n\"Took the over-dose?\"\\n\\n\"Yes!\" Krook almost smacks his lips with the unction of a horrible\\ninterest.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t say. I should think it unlikely, as he has been in the habit\\nof taking so much. But nobody can tell. He was very poor, I suppose?\"\\n\\n\"I suppose he was. His room--don\\'t look rich,\" says Krook, who might\\nhave changed eyes with his cat, as he casts his sharp glance around.\\n\"But I have never been in it since he had it, and he was too close to\\nname his circumstances to me.\"\\n\\n\"Did he owe you any rent?\"\\n\\n\"Six weeks.\"\\n\\n\"He will never pay it!\" says the young man, resuming his examination.\\n\"It is beyond a doubt that he is indeed as dead as Pharaoh; and to\\njudge from his appearance and condition, I should think it a happy\\nrelease. Yet he must have been a good figure when a youth, and I dare\\nsay, good-looking.\" He says this, not unfeelingly, while sitting on\\nthe bedstead\\'s edge with his face towards that other face and his\\nhand upon the region of the heart. \"I recollect once thinking there\\nwas something in his manner, uncouth as it was, that denoted a fall\\nin life. Was that so?\" he continues, looking round.\\n\\nKrook replies, \"You might as well ask me to describe the ladies whose\\nheads of hair I have got in sacks downstairs. Than that he was my\\nlodger for a year and a half and lived--or didn\\'t live--by\\nlaw-writing, I know no more of him.\"\\n\\nDuring this dialogue Mr. Tulkinghorn has stood aloof by the old\\nportmanteau, with his hands behind him, equally removed, to all\\nappearance, from all three kinds of interest exhibited near the\\nbed--from the young surgeon\\'s professional interest in death,\\nnoticeable as being quite apart from his remarks on the deceased as\\nan individual; from the old man\\'s unction; and the little crazy\\nwoman\\'s awe. His imperturbable face has been as inexpressive as his\\nrusty clothes. One could not even say he has been thinking all this\\nwhile. He has shown neither patience nor impatience, nor attention\\nnor abstraction. He has shown nothing but his shell. As easily might\\nthe tone of a delicate musical instrument be inferred from its case,\\nas the tone of Mr. Tulkinghorn from his case.\\n\\nHe now interposes, addressing the young surgeon in his unmoved,\\nprofessional way.\\n\\n\"I looked in here,\" he observes, \"just before you, with the\\nintention of giving this deceased man, whom I never saw alive, some\\nemployment at his trade of copying. I had heard of him from my\\nstationer--Snagsby of Cook\\'s Court. Since no one here knows anything\\nabout him, it might be as well to send for Snagsby. Ah!\" to the\\nlittle crazy woman, who has often seen him in court, and whom he has\\noften seen, and who proposes, in frightened dumb-show, to go for the\\nlaw-stationer. \"Suppose you do!\"\\n\\nWhile she is gone, the surgeon abandons his hopeless investigation\\nand covers its subject with the patchwork counterpane. Mr. Krook and\\nhe interchange a word or two. Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing, but\\nstands, ever, near the old portmanteau.\\n\\nMr. Snagsby arrives hastily in his grey coat and his black sleeves.\\n\"Dear me, dear me,\" he says; \"and it has come to this, has it! Bless\\nmy soul!\"\\n\\n\"Can you give the person of the house any information about this\\nunfortunate creature, Snagsby?\" inquires Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"He was in\\narrears with his rent, it seems. And he must be buried, you know.\"\\n\\n\"Well, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby, coughing his apologetic cough behind\\nhis hand, \"I really don\\'t know what advice I could offer, except\\nsending for the beadle.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t speak of advice,\" returns Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"I could\\nadvise--\"\\n\\n\"No one better, sir, I am sure,\" says Mr. Snagsby, with his\\ndeferential cough.\\n\\n\"I speak of affording some clue to his connexions, or to where he\\ncame from, or to anything concerning him.\"\\n\\n\"I assure you, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby after prefacing his reply with\\nhis cough of general propitiation, \"that I no more know where he came\\nfrom than I know--\"\\n\\n\"Where he has gone to, perhaps,\" suggests the surgeon to help him\\nout.\\n\\nA pause. Mr. Tulkinghorn looking at the law-stationer. Mr. Krook,\\nwith his mouth open, looking for somebody to speak next.\\n\\n\"As to his connexions, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby, \"if a person was to\\nsay to me, \\'Snagsby, here\\'s twenty thousand pound down, ready for you\\nin the Bank of England if you\\'ll only name one of \\'em,\\' I couldn\\'t do\\nit, sir! About a year and a half ago--to the best of my belief, at\\nthe time when he first came to lodge at the present rag and bottle\\nshop--\"\\n\\n\"That was the time!\" says Krook with a nod.\\n\\n\"About a year and a half ago,\" says Mr. Snagsby, strengthened, \"he\\ncame into our place one morning after breakfast, and finding my\\nlittle woman (which I name Mrs. Snagsby when I use that appellation)\\nin our shop, produced a specimen of his handwriting and gave her to\\nunderstand that he was in want of copying work to do and was, not to\\nput too fine a point upon it,\" a favourite apology for plain speaking\\nwith Mr. Snagsby, which he always offers with a sort of argumentative\\nfrankness, \"hard up! My little woman is not in general partial to\\nstrangers, particular--not to put too fine a point upon it--when they\\nwant anything. But she was rather took by something about this\\nperson, whether by his being unshaved, or by his hair being in want\\nof attention, or by what other ladies\\' reasons, I leave you to judge;\\nand she accepted of the specimen, and likewise of the address. My\\nlittle woman hasn\\'t a good ear for names,\" proceeds Mr. Snagsby after\\nconsulting his cough of consideration behind his hand, \"and she\\nconsidered Nemo equally the same as Nimrod. In consequence of which,\\nshe got into a habit of saying to me at meals, \\'Mr. Snagsby, you\\nhaven\\'t found Nimrod any work yet!\\' or \\'Mr. Snagsby, why didn\\'t you\\ngive that eight and thirty Chancery folio in Jarndyce to Nimrod?\\' or\\nsuch like. And that is the way he gradually fell into job-work at our\\nplace; and that is the most I know of him except that he was a quick\\nhand, and a hand not sparing of night-work, and that if you gave him\\nout, say, five and forty folio on the Wednesday night, you would have\\nit brought in on the Thursday morning. All of which--\" Mr. Snagsby\\nconcludes by politely motioning with his hat towards the bed, as much\\nas to add, \"I have no doubt my honourable friend would confirm if he\\nwere in a condition to do it.\"\\n\\n\"Hadn\\'t you better see,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn to Krook, \"whether he\\nhad any papers that may enlighten you? There will be an inquest, and\\nyou will be asked the question. You can read?\"\\n\\n\"No, I can\\'t,\" returns the old man with a sudden grin.\\n\\n\"Snagsby,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, \"look over the room for him. He will\\nget into some trouble or difficulty otherwise. Being here, I\\'ll wait\\nif you make haste, and then I can testify on his behalf, if it should\\never be necessary, that all was fair and right. If you will hold the\\ncandle for Mr. Snagsby, my friend, he\\'ll soon see whether there is\\nanything to help you.\"\\n\\n\"In the first place, here\\'s an old portmanteau, sir,\" says Snagsby.\\n\\nAh, to be sure, so there is! Mr. Tulkinghorn does not appear to have\\nseen it before, though he is standing so close to it, and though\\nthere is very little else, heaven knows.\\n\\nThe marine-store merchant holds the light, and the law-stationer\\nconducts the search. The surgeon leans against the corner of the\\nchimney-piece; Miss Flite peeps and trembles just within the door.\\nThe apt old scholar of the old school, with his dull black breeches\\ntied with ribbons at the knees, his large black waistcoat, his\\nlong-sleeved black coat, and his wisp of limp white neckerchief tied\\nin the bow the peerage knows so well, stands in exactly the same\\nplace and attitude.\\n\\nThere are some worthless articles of clothing in the old portmanteau;\\nthere is a bundle of pawnbrokers\\' duplicates, those turnpike tickets\\non the road of poverty; there is a crumpled paper, smelling of opium,\\non which are scrawled rough memoranda--as, took, such a day, so many\\ngrains; took, such another day, so many more--begun some time ago, as\\nif with the intention of being regularly continued, but soon left\\noff. There are a few dirty scraps of newspapers, all referring to\\ncoroners\\' inquests; there is nothing else. They search the cupboard\\nand the drawer of the ink-splashed table. There is not a morsel of an\\nold letter or of any other writing in either. The young surgeon\\nexamines the dress on the law-writer. A knife and some odd halfpence\\nare all he finds. Mr. Snagsby\\'s suggestion is the practical\\nsuggestion after all, and the beadle must be called in.\\n\\nSo the little crazy lodger goes for the beadle, and the rest come out\\nof the room. \"Don\\'t leave the cat there!\" says the surgeon; \"that\\nwon\\'t do!\" Mr. Krook therefore drives her out before him, and she\\ngoes furtively downstairs, winding her lithe tail and licking her\\nlips.\\n\\n\"Good night!\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, and goes home to Allegory and\\nmeditation.\\n\\nBy this time the news has got into the court. Groups of its\\ninhabitants assemble to discuss the thing, and the outposts of the\\narmy of observation (principally boys) are pushed forward to Mr.\\nKrook\\'s window, which they closely invest. A policeman has already\\nwalked up to the room, and walked down again to the door, where he\\nstands like a tower, only condescending to see the boys at his base\\noccasionally; but whenever he does see them, they quail and fall\\nback. Mrs. Perkins, who has not been for some weeks on speaking terms\\nwith Mrs. Piper in consequence for an unpleasantness originating in\\nyoung Perkins\\' having \"fetched\" young Piper \"a crack,\" renews her\\nfriendly intercourse on this auspicious occasion. The potboy at the\\ncorner, who is a privileged amateur, as possessing official knowledge\\nof life and having to deal with drunken men occasionally, exchanges\\nconfidential communications with the policeman and has the appearance\\nof an impregnable youth, unassailable by truncheons and unconfinable\\nin station-houses. People talk across the court out of window, and\\nbare-headed scouts come hurrying in from Chancery Lane to know what\\'s\\nthe matter. The general feeling seems to be that it\\'s a blessing Mr.\\nKrook warn\\'t made away with first, mingled with a little natural\\ndisappointment that he was not. In the midst of this sensation, the\\nbeadle arrives.\\n\\nThe beadle, though generally understood in the neighbourhood to be a\\nridiculous institution, is not without a certain popularity for the\\nmoment, if it were only as a man who is going to see the body. The\\npoliceman considers him an imbecile civilian, a remnant of the\\nbarbarous watchmen times, but gives him admission as something that\\nmust be borne with until government shall abolish him. The sensation\\nis heightened as the tidings spread from mouth to mouth that the\\nbeadle is on the ground and has gone in.\\n\\nBy and by the beadle comes out, once more intensifying the sensation,\\nwhich has rather languished in the interval. He is understood to be\\nin want of witnesses for the inquest to-morrow who can tell the\\ncoroner and jury anything whatever respecting the deceased. Is\\nimmediately referred to innumerable people who can tell nothing\\nwhatever. Is made more imbecile by being constantly informed that\\nMrs. Green\\'s son \"was a law-writer his-self and knowed him better\\nthan anybody,\" which son of Mrs. Green\\'s appears, on inquiry, to be\\nat the present time aboard a vessel bound for China, three months\\nout, but considered accessible by telegraph on application to the\\nLords of the Admiralty. Beadle goes into various shops and parlours,\\nexamining the inhabitants, always shutting the door first, and by\\nexclusion, delay, and general idiotcy exasperating the public.\\nPoliceman seen to smile to potboy. Public loses interest and\\nundergoes reaction. Taunts the beadle in shrill youthful voices with\\nhaving boiled a boy, choruses fragments of a popular song to that\\neffect and importing that the boy was made into soup for the\\nworkhouse. Policeman at last finds it necessary to support the law\\nand seize a vocalist, who is released upon the flight of the rest on\\ncondition of his getting out of this then, come, and cutting it--a\\ncondition he immediately observes. So the sensation dies off for the\\ntime; and the unmoved policeman (to whom a little opium, more or\\nless, is nothing), with his shining hat, stiff stock, inflexible\\ngreat-coat, stout belt and bracelet, and all things fitting, pursues\\nhis lounging way with a heavy tread, beating the palms of his white\\ngloves one against the other and stopping now and then at a\\nstreet-corner to look casually about for anything between a lost\\nchild and a murder.\\n\\nUnder cover of the night, the feeble-minded beadle comes flitting\\nabout Chancery Lane with his summonses, in which every juror\\'s name\\nis wrongly spelt, and nothing rightly spelt but the beadle\\'s own\\nname, which nobody can read or wants to know. The summonses served\\nand his witnesses forewarned, the beadle goes to Mr. Krook\\'s to keep\\na small appointment he has made with certain paupers, who, presently\\narriving, are conducted upstairs, where they leave the great eyes in\\nthe shutter something new to stare at, in that last shape which\\nearthly lodgings take for No one--and for Every one.\\n\\nAnd all that night the coffin stands ready by the old portmanteau;\\nand the lonely figure on the bed, whose path in life has lain through\\nfive and forty years, lies there with no more track behind him that\\nany one can trace than a deserted infant.\\n\\nNext day the court is all alive--is like a fair, as Mrs. Perkins,\\nmore than reconciled to Mrs. Piper, says in amicable conversation\\nwith that excellent woman. The coroner is to sit in the first-floor\\nroom at the Sol\\'s Arms, where the Harmonic Meetings take place twice\\na week and where the chair is filled by a gentleman of professional\\ncelebrity, faced by Little Swills, the comic vocalist, who hopes\\n(according to the bill in the window) that his friends will rally\\nround him and support first-rate talent. The Sol\\'s Arms does a brisk\\nstroke of business all the morning. Even children so require\\nsustaining under the general excitement that a pieman who has\\nestablished himself for the occasion at the corner of the court says\\nhis brandy-balls go off like smoke. What time the beadle, hovering\\nbetween the door of Mr. Krook\\'s establishment and the door of the\\nSol\\'s Arms, shows the curiosity in his keeping to a few discreet\\nspirits and accepts the compliment of a glass of ale or so in return.\\n\\nAt the appointed hour arrives the coroner, for whom the jurymen are\\nwaiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good\\ndry skittle-ground attached to the Sol\\'s Arms. The coroner frequents\\nmore public-houses than any man alive. The smell of sawdust, beer,\\ntobacco-smoke, and spirits is inseparable in his vocation from death\\nin its most awful shapes. He is conducted by the beadle and the\\nlandlord to the Harmonic Meeting Room, where he puts his hat on the\\npiano and takes a Windsor-chair at the head of a long table formed of\\nseveral short tables put together and ornamented with glutinous rings\\nin endless involutions, made by pots and glasses. As many of the jury\\nas can crowd together at the table sit there. The rest get among the\\nspittoons and pipes or lean against the piano. Over the coroner\\'s\\nhead is a small iron garland, the pendant handle of a bell, which\\nrather gives the majesty of the court the appearance of going to be\\nhanged presently.\\n\\nCall over and swear the jury! While the ceremony is in progress,\\nsensation is created by the entrance of a chubby little man in a\\nlarge shirt-collar, with a moist eye and an inflamed nose, who\\nmodestly takes a position near the door as one of the general public,\\nbut seems familiar with the room too. A whisper circulates that this\\nis Little Swills. It is considered not unlikely that he will get up\\nan imitation of the coroner and make it the principal feature of the\\nHarmonic Meeting in the evening.\\n\\n\"Well, gentlemen--\" the coroner begins.\\n\\n\"Silence there, will you!\" says the beadle. Not to the coroner,\\nthough it might appear so.\\n\\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" resumes the coroner. \"You are impanelled here to\\ninquire into the death of a certain man. Evidence will be given\\nbefore you as to the circumstances attending that death, and you will\\ngive your verdict according to the--skittles; they must be stopped,\\nyou know, beadle!--evidence, and not according to anything else. The\\nfirst thing to be done is to view the body.\"\\n\\n\"Make way there!\" cries the beadle.\\n\\nSo they go out in a loose procession, something after the manner of a\\nstraggling funeral, and make their inspection in Mr. Krook\\'s back\\nsecond floor, from which a few of the jurymen retire pale and\\nprecipitately. The beadle is very careful that two gentlemen not very\\nneat about the cuffs and buttons (for whose accommodation he has\\nprovided a special little table near the coroner in the Harmonic\\nMeeting Room) should see all that is to be seen. For they are the\\npublic chroniclers of such inquiries by the line; and he is not\\nsuperior to the universal human infirmity, but hopes to read in print\\nwhat \"Mooney, the active and intelligent beadle of the district,\"\\nsaid and did and even aspires to see the name of Mooney as familiarly\\nand patronizingly mentioned as the name of the hangman is, according\\nto the latest examples.\\n\\nLittle Swills is waiting for the coroner and jury on their return.\\nMr. Tulkinghorn, also. Mr. Tulkinghorn is received with distinction\\nand seated near the coroner between that high judicial officer, a\\nbagatelle-board, and the coal-box. The inquiry proceeds. The jury\\nlearn how the subject of their inquiry died, and learn no more about\\nhim. \"A very eminent solicitor is in attendance, gentlemen,\" says the\\ncoroner, \"who, I am informed, was accidentally present when discovery\\nof the death was made, but he could only repeat the evidence you have\\nalready heard from the surgeon, the landlord, the lodger, and the\\nlaw-stationer, and it is not necessary to trouble him. Is anybody in\\nattendance who knows anything more?\"\\n\\nMrs. Piper pushed forward by Mrs. Perkins. Mrs. Piper sworn.\\n\\nAnastasia Piper, gentlemen. Married woman. Now, Mrs. Piper, what have\\nyou got to say about this?\\n\\nWhy, Mrs. Piper has a good deal to say, chiefly in parentheses and\\nwithout punctuation, but not much to tell. Mrs. Piper lives in the\\ncourt (which her husband is a cabinet-maker), and it has long been\\nwell beknown among the neighbours (counting from the day next but one\\nbefore the half-baptizing of Alexander James Piper aged eighteen\\nmonths and four days old on accounts of not being expected to live\\nsuch was the sufferings gentlemen of that child in his gums) as the\\nplaintive--so Mrs. Piper insists on calling the deceased--was\\nreported to have sold himself. Thinks it was the plaintive\\'s air in\\nwhich that report originatinin. See the plaintive often and\\nconsidered as his air was feariocious and not to be allowed to go\\nabout some children being timid (and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins\\nmay be brought forard for she is here and will do credit to her\\nhusband and herself and family). Has seen the plaintive wexed and\\nworrited by the children (for children they will ever be and you\\ncannot expect them specially if of playful dispositions to be\\nMethoozellers which you was not yourself). On accounts of this and\\nhis dark looks has often dreamed as she see him take a pick-axe from\\nhis pocket and split Johnny\\'s head (which the child knows not fear\\nand has repeatually called after him close at his eels). Never\\nhowever see the plaintive take a pick-axe or any other wepping far\\nfrom it. Has seen him hurry away when run and called after as if not\\npartial to children and never see him speak to neither child nor\\ngrown person at any time (excepting the boy that sweeps the crossing\\ndown the lane over the way round the corner which if he was here\\nwould tell you that he has been seen a-speaking to him frequent).\\n\\nSays the coroner, is that boy here? Says the beadle, no, sir, he is\\nnot here. Says the coroner, go and fetch him then. In the absence of\\nthe active and intelligent, the coroner converses with Mr.\\nTulkinghorn.\\n\\nOh! Here\\'s the boy, gentlemen!\\n\\nHere he is, very muddy, very hoarse, very ragged. Now, boy! But stop\\na minute. Caution. This boy must be put through a few preliminary\\npaces.\\n\\nName, Jo. Nothing else that he knows on. Don\\'t know that everybody\\nhas two names. Never heerd of sich a think. Don\\'t know that Jo is\\nshort for a longer name. Thinks it long enough for HIM. HE don\\'t find\\nno fault with it. Spell it? No. HE can\\'t spell it. No father, no\\nmother, no friends. Never been to school. What\\'s home? Knows a\\nbroom\\'s a broom, and knows it\\'s wicked to tell a lie. Don\\'t recollect\\nwho told him about the broom or about the lie, but knows both. Can\\'t\\nexactly say what\\'ll be done to him arter he\\'s dead if he tells a lie\\nto the gentlemen here, but believes it\\'ll be something wery bad to\\npunish him, and serve him right--and so he\\'ll tell the truth.\\n\\n\"This won\\'t do, gentlemen!\" says the coroner with a melancholy shake\\nof the head.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you think you can receive his evidence, sir?\" asks an\\nattentive juryman.\\n\\n\"Out of the question,\" says the coroner. \"You have heard the boy.\\n\\'Can\\'t exactly say\\' won\\'t do, you know. We can\\'t take THAT in a court\\nof justice, gentlemen. It\\'s terrible depravity. Put the boy aside.\"\\n\\nBoy put aside, to the great edification of the audience, especially\\nof Little Swills, the comic vocalist.\\n\\nNow. Is there any other witness? No other witness.\\n\\nVery well, gentlemen! Here\\'s a man unknown, proved to have been in\\nthe habit of taking opium in large quantities for a year and a half,\\nfound dead of too much opium. If you think you have any evidence to\\nlead you to the conclusion that he committed suicide, you will come\\nto that conclusion. If you think it is a case of accidental death,\\nyou will find a verdict accordingly.\\n\\nVerdict accordingly. Accidental death. No doubt. Gentlemen, you are\\ndischarged. Good afternoon.\\n\\nWhile the coroner buttons his great-coat, Mr. Tulkinghorn and he give\\nprivate audience to the rejected witness in a corner.\\n\\nThat graceless creature only knows that the dead man (whom he\\nrecognized just now by his yellow face and black hair) was sometimes\\nhooted and pursued about the streets. That one cold winter night when\\nhe, the boy, was shivering in a doorway near his crossing, the man\\nturned to look at him, and came back, and having questioned him and\\nfound that he had not a friend in the world, said, \"Neither have I.\\nNot one!\" and gave him the price of a supper and a night\\'s lodging.\\nThat the man had often spoken to him since and asked him whether he\\nslept sound at night, and how he bore cold and hunger, and whether he\\never wished to die, and similar strange questions. That when the man\\nhad no money, he would say in passing, \"I am as poor as you to-day,\\nJo,\" but that when he had any, he had always (as the boy most\\nheartily believes) been glad to give him some.\\n\\n\"He was wery good to me,\" says the boy, wiping his eyes with his\\nwretched sleeve. \"Wen I see him a-layin\\' so stritched out just now, I\\nwished he could have heerd me tell him so. He wos wery good to me, he\\nwos!\"\\n\\nAs he shuffles downstairs, Mr. Snagsby, lying in wait for him, puts a\\nhalf-crown in his hand. \"If you ever see me coming past your crossing\\nwith my little woman--I mean a lady--\" says Mr. Snagsby with his\\nfinger on his nose, \"don\\'t allude to it!\"\\n\\nFor some little time the jurymen hang about the Sol\\'s Arms\\ncolloquially. In the sequel, half-a-dozen are caught up in a cloud of\\npipe-smoke that pervades the parlour of the Sol\\'s Arms; two stroll to\\nHampstead; and four engage to go half-price to the play at night, and\\ntop up with oysters. Little Swills is treated on several hands. Being\\nasked what he thinks of the proceedings, characterizes them (his\\nstrength lying in a slangular direction) as \"a rummy start.\" The\\nlandlord of the Sol\\'s Arms, finding Little Swills so popular,\\ncommends him highly to the jurymen and public, observing that for a\\nsong in character he don\\'t know his equal and that that man\\'s\\ncharacter-wardrobe would fill a cart.\\n\\nThus, gradually the Sol\\'s Arms melts into the shadowy night and then\\nflares out of it strong in gas. The Harmonic Meeting hour arriving,\\nthe gentleman of professional celebrity takes the chair, is faced\\n(red-faced) by Little Swills; their friends rally round them and\\nsupport first-rate talent. In the zenith of the evening, Little\\nSwills says, \"Gentlemen, if you\\'ll permit me, I\\'ll attempt a short\\ndescription of a scene of real life that came off here to-day.\" Is\\nmuch applauded and encouraged; goes out of the room as Swills; comes\\nin as the coroner (not the least in the world like him); describes\\nthe inquest, with recreative intervals of piano-forte accompaniment,\\nto the refrain: With his (the coroner\\'s) tippy tol li doll, tippy tol\\nlo doll, tippy tol li doll, Dee!\\n\\nThe jingling piano at last is silent, and the Harmonic friends rally\\nround their pillows. Then there is rest around the lonely figure, now\\nlaid in its last earthly habitation; and it is watched by the gaunt\\neyes in the shutters through some quiet hours of night. If this\\nforlorn man could have been prophetically seen lying here by the\\nmother at whose breast he nestled, a little child, with eyes upraised\\nto her loving face, and soft hand scarcely knowing how to close upon\\nthe neck to which it crept, what an impossibility the vision would\\nhave seemed! Oh, if in brighter days the now-extinguished fire within\\nhim ever burned for one woman who held him in her heart, where is\\nshe, while these ashes are above the ground!\\n\\nIt is anything but a night of rest at Mr. Snagsby\\'s, in Cook\\'s Court,\\nwhere Guster murders sleep by going, as Mr. Snagsby himself\\nallows--not to put too fine a point upon it--out of one fit into\\ntwenty. The occasion of this seizure is that Guster has a tender\\nheart and a susceptible something that possibly might have been\\nimagination, but for Tooting and her patron saint. Be it what it may,\\nnow, it was so direfully impressed at tea-time by Mr. Snagsby\\'s\\naccount of the inquiry at which he had assisted that at supper-time\\nshe projected herself into the kitchen, preceded by a flying Dutch\\ncheese, and fell into a fit of unusual duration, which she only came\\nout of to go into another, and another, and so on through a chain of\\nfits, with short intervals between, of which she has pathetically\\navailed herself by consuming them in entreaties to Mrs. Snagsby not\\nto give her warning \"when she quite comes to,\" and also in appeals to\\nthe whole establishment to lay her down on the stones and go to bed.\\nHence, Mr. Snagsby, at last hearing the cock at the little dairy in\\nCursitor Street go into that disinterested ecstasy of his on the\\nsubject of daylight, says, drawing a long breath, though the most\\npatient of men, \"I thought you was dead, I am sure!\"\\n\\nWhat question this enthusiastic fowl supposes he settles when he\\nstrains himself to such an extent, or why he should thus crow (so men\\ncrow on various triumphant public occasions, however) about what\\ncannot be of any moment to him, is his affair. It is enough that\\ndaylight comes, morning comes, noon comes.\\n\\nThen the active and intelligent, who has got into the morning papers\\nas such, comes with his pauper company to Mr. Krook\\'s and bears off\\nthe body of our dear brother here departed to a hemmed-in churchyard,\\npestiferous and obscene, whence malignant diseases are communicated\\nto the bodies of our dear brothers and sisters who have not departed,\\nwhile our dear brothers and sisters who hang about official\\nback-stairs--would to heaven they HAD departed!--are very complacent\\nand agreeable. Into a beastly scrap of ground which a Turk would\\nreject as a savage abomination and a Caffre would shudder at, they\\nbring our dear brother here departed to receive Christian burial.\\n\\nWith houses looking on, on every side, save where a reeking little\\ntunnel of a court gives access to the iron gate--with every villainy\\nof life in action close on death, and every poisonous element of\\ndeath in action close on life--here they lower our dear brother down\\na foot or two, here sow him in corruption, to be raised in\\ncorruption: an avenging ghost at many a sick-bedside, a shameful\\ntestimony to future ages how civilization and barbarism walked this\\nboastful island together.\\n\\nCome night, come darkness, for you cannot come too soon or stay too\\nlong by such a place as this! Come, straggling lights into the\\nwindows of the ugly houses; and you who do iniquity therein, do it at\\nleast with this dread scene shut out! Come, flame of gas, burning so\\nsullenly above the iron gate, on which the poisoned air deposits its\\nwitch-ointment slimy to the touch! It is well that you should call to\\nevery passerby, \"Look here!\"\\n\\nWith the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel-court to\\nthe outside of the iron gate. It holds the gate with its hands and\\nlooks in between the bars, stands looking in for a little while.\\n\\nIt then, with an old broom it carries, softly sweeps the step and\\nmakes the archway clean. It does so very busily and trimly, looks in\\nagain a little while, and so departs.\\n\\nJo, is it thou? Well, well! Though a rejected witness, who \"can\\'t\\nexactly say\" what will be done to him in greater hands than men\\'s,\\nthou art not quite in outer darkness. There is something like a\\ndistant ray of light in thy muttered reason for this: \"He wos wery\\ngood to me, he wos!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nIt has left off raining down in Lincolnshire at last, and Chesney\\nWold has taken heart. Mrs. Rouncewell is full of hospitable cares,\\nfor Sir Leicester and my Lady are coming home from Paris. The\\nfashionable intelligence has found it out and communicates the glad\\ntidings to benighted England. It has also found out that they will\\nentertain a brilliant and distinguished circle of the ELITE of the\\nBEAU MONDE (the fashionable intelligence is weak in English, but a\\ngiant refreshed in French) at the ancient and hospitable family seat\\nin Lincolnshire.\\n\\nFor the greater honour of the brilliant and distinguished circle, and\\nof Chesney Wold into the bargain, the broken arch of the bridge in\\nthe park is mended; and the water, now retired within its proper\\nlimits and again spanned gracefully, makes a figure in the prospect\\nfrom the house. The clear, cold sunshine glances into the brittle\\nwoods and approvingly beholds the sharp wind scattering the leaves\\nand drying the moss. It glides over the park after the moving shadows\\nof the clouds, and chases them, and never catches them, all day. It\\nlooks in at the windows and touches the ancestral portraits with bars\\nand patches of brightness never contemplated by the painters. Athwart\\nthe picture of my Lady, over the great chimney-piece, it throws a\\nbroad bend-sinister of light that strikes down crookedly into the\\nhearth and seems to rend it.\\n\\nThrough the same cold sunshine and the same sharp wind, my Lady and\\nSir Leicester, in their travelling chariot (my Lady\\'s woman and Sir\\nLeicester\\'s man affectionate in the rumble), start for home. With a\\nconsiderable amount of jingling and whip-cracking, and many plunging\\ndemonstrations on the part of two bare-backed horses and two centaurs\\nwith glazed hats, jack-boots, and flowing manes and tails, they\\nrattle out of the yard of the Hotel Bristol in the Place Vendome and\\ncanter between the sun-and-shadow-chequered colonnade of the Rue de\\nRivoli and the garden of the ill-fated palace of a headless king and\\nqueen, off by the Place of Concord, and the Elysian Fields, and the\\nGate of the Star, out of Paris.\\n\\nSooth to say, they cannot go away too fast, for even here my Lady\\nDedlock has been bored to death. Concert, assembly, opera, theatre,\\ndrive, nothing is new to my Lady under the worn-out heavens. Only\\nlast Sunday, when poor wretches were gay--within the walls playing\\nwith children among the clipped trees and the statues in the Palace\\nGarden; walking, a score abreast, in the Elysian Fields, made more\\nElysian by performing dogs and wooden horses; between whiles\\nfiltering (a few) through the gloomy Cathedral of Our Lady to say a\\nword or two at the base of a pillar within flare of a rusty little\\ngridiron-full of gusty little tapers; without the walls encompassing\\nParis with dancing, love-making, wine-drinking, tobacco-smoking,\\ntomb-visiting, billiard card and domino playing, quack-doctoring, and\\nmuch murderous refuse, animate and inanimate--only last Sunday, my\\nLady, in the desolation of Boredom and the clutch of Giant Despair,\\nalmost hated her own maid for being in spirits.\\n\\nShe cannot, therefore, go too fast from Paris. Weariness of soul lies\\nbefore her, as it lies behind--her Ariel has put a girdle of it round\\nthe whole earth, and it cannot be unclasped--but the imperfect remedy\\nis always to fly from the last place where it has been experienced.\\nFling Paris back into the distance, then, exchanging it for endless\\navenues and cross-avenues of wintry trees! And, when next beheld, let\\nit be some leagues away, with the Gate of the Star a white speck\\nglittering in the sun, and the city a mere mound in a plain--two dark\\nsquare towers rising out of it, and light and shadow descending on it\\naslant, like the angels in Jacob\\'s dream!\\n\\nSir Leicester is generally in a complacent state, and rarely bored.\\nWhen he has nothing else to do, he can always contemplate his own\\ngreatness. It is a considerable advantage to a man to have so\\ninexhaustible a subject. After reading his letters, he leans back in\\nhis corner of the carriage and generally reviews his importance to\\nsociety.\\n\\n\"You have an unusual amount of correspondence this morning?\" says my\\nLady after a long time. She is fatigued with reading. Has almost read\\na page in twenty miles.\\n\\n\"Nothing in it, though. Nothing whatever.\"\\n\\n\"I saw one of Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s long effusions, I think?\"\\n\\n\"You see everything,\" says Sir Leicester with admiration.\\n\\n\"Ha!\" sighs my Lady. \"He is the most tiresome of men!\"\\n\\n\"He sends--I really beg your pardon--he sends,\" says Sir Leicester,\\nselecting the letter and unfolding it, \"a message to you. Our\\nstopping to change horses as I came to his postscript drove it out of\\nmy memory. I beg you\\'ll excuse me. He says--\" Sir Leicester is so\\nlong in taking out his eye-glass and adjusting it that my Lady looks\\na little irritated. \"He says \\'In the matter of the right of way--\\' I\\nbeg your pardon, that\\'s not the place. He says--yes! Here I have it!\\nHe says, \\'I beg my respectful compliments to my Lady, who, I hope,\\nhas benefited by the change. Will you do me the favour to mention (as\\nit may interest her) that I have something to tell her on her return\\nin reference to the person who copied the affidavit in the Chancery\\nsuit, which so powerfully stimulated her curiosity. I have seen\\nhim.\\'\"\\n\\nMy Lady, leaning forward, looks out of her window.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the message,\" observes Sir Leicester.\\n\\n\"I should like to walk a little,\" says my Lady, still looking out of\\nher window.\\n\\n\"Walk?\" repeats Sir Leicester in a tone of surprise.\\n\\n\"I should like to walk a little,\" says my Lady with unmistakable\\ndistinctness. \"Please to stop the carriage.\"\\n\\nThe carriage is stopped, the affectionate man alights from the\\nrumble, opens the door, and lets down the steps, obedient to an\\nimpatient motion of my Lady\\'s hand. My Lady alights so quickly and\\nwalks away so quickly that Sir Leicester, for all his scrupulous\\npoliteness, is unable to assist her, and is left behind. A space of a\\nminute or two has elapsed before he comes up with her. She smiles,\\nlooks very handsome, takes his arm, lounges with him for a quarter of\\na mile, is very much bored, and resumes her seat in the carriage.\\n\\nThe rattle and clatter continue through the greater part of three\\ndays, with more or less of bell-jingling and whip-cracking, and more\\nor less plunging of centaurs and bare-backed horses. Their courtly\\npoliteness to each other at the hotels where they tarry is the theme\\nof general admiration. Though my Lord IS a little aged for my Lady,\\nsays Madame, the hostess of the Golden Ape, and though he might be\\nher amiable father, one can see at a glance that they love each\\nother. One observes my Lord with his white hair, standing, hat in\\nhand, to help my Lady to and from the carriage. One observes my Lady,\\nhow recognisant of my Lord\\'s politeness, with an inclination of her\\ngracious head and the concession of her so-genteel fingers! It is\\nravishing!\\n\\nThe sea has no appreciation of great men, but knocks them about like\\nthe small fry. It is habitually hard upon Sir Leicester, whose\\ncountenance it greenly mottles in the manner of sage-cheese and in\\nwhose aristocratic system it effects a dismal revolution. It is the\\nRadical of Nature to him. Nevertheless, his dignity gets over it\\nafter stopping to refit, and he goes on with my Lady for Chesney\\nWold, lying only one night in London on the way to Lincolnshire.\\n\\nThrough the same cold sunlight, colder as the day declines, and\\nthrough the same sharp wind, sharper as the separate shadows of bare\\ntrees gloom together in the woods, and as the Ghost\\'s Walk, touched\\nat the western corner by a pile of fire in the sky, resigns itself to\\ncoming night, they drive into the park. The rooks, swinging in their\\nlofty houses in the elm-tree avenue, seem to discuss the question of\\nthe occupancy of the carriage as it passes underneath, some agreeing\\nthat Sir Leicester and my Lady are come down, some arguing with\\nmalcontents who won\\'t admit it, now all consenting to consider the\\nquestion disposed of, now all breaking out again in violent debate,\\nincited by one obstinate and drowsy bird who will persist in putting\\nin a last contradictory croak. Leaving them to swing and caw, the\\ntravelling chariot rolls on to the house, where fires gleam warmly\\nthrough some of the windows, though not through so many as to give an\\ninhabited expression to the darkening mass of front. But the\\nbrilliant and distinguished circle will soon do that.\\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell is in attendance and receives Sir Leicester\\'s\\ncustomary shake of the hand with a profound curtsy.\\n\\n\"How do you do, Mrs. Rouncewell? I am glad to see you.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I have the honour of welcoming you in good health, Sir\\nLeicester?\"\\n\\n\"In excellent health, Mrs. Rouncewell.\"\\n\\n\"My Lady is looking charmingly well,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell with\\nanother curtsy.\\n\\nMy Lady signifies, without profuse expenditure of words, that she is\\nas wearily well as she can hope to be.\\n\\nBut Rosa is in the distance, behind the housekeeper; and my Lady, who\\nhas not subdued the quickness of her observation, whatever else she\\nmay have conquered, asks, \"Who is that girl?\"\\n\\n\"A young scholar of mine, my Lady. Rosa.\"\\n\\n\"Come here, Rosa!\" Lady Dedlock beckons her, with even an appearance\\nof interest. \"Why, do you know how pretty you are, child?\" she says,\\ntouching her shoulder with her two forefingers.\\n\\nRosa, very much abashed, says, \"No, if you please, my Lady!\" and\\nglances up, and glances down, and don\\'t know where to look, but looks\\nall the prettier.\\n\\n\"How old are you?\"\\n\\n\"Nineteen, my Lady.\"\\n\\n\"Nineteen,\" repeats my Lady thoughtfully. \"Take care they don\\'t spoil\\nyou by flattery.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my Lady.\"\\n\\nMy Lady taps her dimpled cheek with the same delicate gloved fingers\\nand goes on to the foot of the oak staircase, where Sir Leicester\\npauses for her as her knightly escort. A staring old Dedlock in a\\npanel, as large as life and as dull, looks as if he didn\\'t know what\\nto make of it, which was probably his general state of mind in the\\ndays of Queen Elizabeth.\\n\\nThat evening, in the housekeeper\\'s room, Rosa can do nothing but\\nmurmur Lady Dedlock\\'s praises. She is so affable, so graceful, so\\nbeautiful, so elegant; has such a sweet voice and such a thrilling\\ntouch that Rosa can feel it yet! Mrs. Rouncewell confirms all this,\\nnot without personal pride, reserving only the one point of\\naffability. Mrs. Rouncewell is not quite sure as to that. Heaven\\nforbid that she should say a syllable in dispraise of any member of\\nthat excellent family, above all, of my Lady, whom the whole world\\nadmires; but if my Lady would only be \"a little more free,\" not quite\\nso cold and distant, Mrs. Rouncewell thinks she would be more\\naffable.\\n\\n\"\\'Tis almost a pity,\" Mrs. Rouncewell adds--only \"almost\" because it\\nborders on impiety to suppose that anything could be better than it\\nis, in such an express dispensation as the Dedlock affairs--\"that my\\nLady has no family. If she had had a daughter now, a grown young\\nlady, to interest her, I think she would have had the only kind of\\nexcellence she wants.\"\\n\\n\"Might not that have made her still more proud, grandmother?\" says\\nWatt, who has been home and come back again, he is such a good\\ngrandson.\\n\\n\"More and most, my dear,\" returns the housekeeper with dignity, \"are\\nwords it\\'s not my place to use--nor so much as to hear--applied to\\nany drawback on my Lady.\"\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, grandmother. But she is proud, is she not?\"\\n\\n\"If she is, she has reason to be. The Dedlock family have always\\nreason to be.\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" says Watt, \"it\\'s to be hoped they line out of their\\nprayer-books a certain passage for the common people about pride and\\nvainglory. Forgive me, grandmother! Only a joke!\"\\n\\n\"Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock, my dear, are not fit subjects for\\njoking.\"\\n\\n\"Sir Leicester is no joke by any means,\" says Watt, \"and I humbly ask\\nhis pardon. I suppose, grandmother, that even with the family and\\ntheir guests down here, there is no objection to my prolonging my\\nstay at the Dedlock Arms for a day or two, as any other traveller\\nmight?\"\\n\\n\"Surely, none in the world, child.\"\\n\\n\"I am glad of that,\" says Watt, \"because I have an inexpressible\\ndesire to extend my knowledge of this beautiful neighbourhood.\"\\n\\nHe happens to glance at Rosa, who looks down and is very shy indeed.\\nBut according to the old superstition, it should be Rosa\\'s ears that\\nburn, and not her fresh bright cheeks, for my Lady\\'s maid is holding\\nforth about her at this moment with surpassing energy.\\n\\nMy Lady\\'s maid is a Frenchwoman of two and thirty, from somewhere in\\nthe southern country about Avignon and Marseilles, a large-eyed brown\\nwoman with black hair who would be handsome but for a certain feline\\nmouth and general uncomfortable tightness of face, rendering the jaws\\ntoo eager and the skull too prominent. There is something indefinably\\nkeen and wan about her anatomy, and she has a watchful way of looking\\nout of the corners of her eyes without turning her head which could\\nbe pleasantly dispensed with, especially when she is in an ill humour\\nand near knives. Through all the good taste of her dress and little\\nadornments, these objections so express themselves that she seems to\\ngo about like a very neat she-wolf imperfectly tamed. Besides being\\naccomplished in all the knowledge appertaining to her post, she is\\nalmost an Englishwoman in her acquaintance with the language;\\nconsequently, she is in no want of words to shower upon Rosa for\\nhaving attracted my Lady\\'s attention, and she pours them out with\\nsuch grim ridicule as she sits at dinner that her companion, the\\naffectionate man, is rather relieved when she arrives at the spoon\\nstage of that performance.\\n\\nHa, ha, ha! She, Hortense, been in my Lady\\'s service since five years\\nand always kept at the distance, and this doll, this puppet,\\ncaressed--absolutely caressed--by my Lady on the moment of her\\narriving at the house! Ha, ha, ha! \"And do you know how pretty you\\nare, child?\" \"No, my Lady.\" You are right there! \"And how old are\\nyou, child! And take care they do not spoil you by flattery, child!\"\\nOh, how droll! It is the BEST thing altogether.\\n\\nIn short, it is such an admirable thing that Mademoiselle Hortense\\ncan\\'t forget it; but at meals for days afterwards, even among her\\ncountrywomen and others attached in like capacity to the troop of\\nvisitors, relapses into silent enjoyment of the joke--an enjoyment\\nexpressed, in her own convivial manner, by an additional tightness of\\nface, thin elongation of compressed lips, and sidewise look, which\\nintense appreciation of humour is frequently reflected in my Lady\\'s\\nmirrors when my Lady is not among them.\\n\\nAll the mirrors in the house are brought into action now, many of\\nthem after a long blank. They reflect handsome faces, simpering\\nfaces, youthful faces, faces of threescore and ten that will not\\nsubmit to be old; the entire collection of faces that have come to\\npass a January week or two at Chesney Wold, and which the fashionable\\nintelligence, a mighty hunter before the Lord, hunts with a keen\\nscent, from their breaking cover at the Court of St. James\\'s to their\\nbeing run down to death. The place in Lincolnshire is all alive. By\\nday guns and voices are heard ringing in the woods, horsemen and\\ncarriages enliven the park roads, servants and hangers-on pervade the\\nvillage and the Dedlock Arms. Seen by night from distant openings in\\nthe trees, the row of windows in the long drawing-room, where my\\nLady\\'s picture hangs over the great chimney-piece, is like a row of\\njewels set in a black frame. On Sunday the chill little church is\\nalmost warmed by so much gallant company, and the general flavour of\\nthe Dedlock dust is quenched in delicate perfumes.\\n\\nThe brilliant and distinguished circle comprehends within it no\\ncontracted amount of education, sense, courage, honour, beauty, and\\nvirtue. Yet there is something a little wrong about it in despite of\\nits immense advantages. What can it be?\\n\\nDandyism? There is no King George the Fourth now (more the pity) to\\nset the dandy fashion; there are no clear-starched jack-towel\\nneckcloths, no short-waisted coats, no false calves, no stays. There\\nare no caricatures, now, of effeminate exquisites so arrayed,\\nswooning in opera boxes with excess of delight and being revived by\\nother dainty creatures poking long-necked scent-bottles at their\\nnoses. There is no beau whom it takes four men at once to shake into\\nhis buckskins, or who goes to see all the executions, or who is\\ntroubled with the self-reproach of having once consumed a pea. But is\\nthere dandyism in the brilliant and distinguished circle\\nnotwithstanding, dandyism of a more mischievous sort, that has got\\nbelow the surface and is doing less harmless things than\\njack-towelling itself and stopping its own digestion, to which no\\nrational person need particularly object?\\n\\nWhy, yes. It cannot be disguised. There ARE at Chesney Wold this\\nJanuary week some ladies and gentlemen of the newest fashion, who\\nhave set up a dandyism--in religion, for instance. Who in mere\\nlackadaisical want of an emotion have agreed upon a little dandy talk\\nabout the vulgar wanting faith in things in general, meaning in the\\nthings that have been tried and found wanting, as though a low fellow\\nshould unaccountably lose faith in a bad shilling after finding it\\nout! Who would make the vulgar very picturesque and faithful by\\nputting back the hands upon the clock of time and cancelling a few\\nhundred years of history.\\n\\nThere are also ladies and gentlemen of another fashion, not so new,\\nbut very elegant, who have agreed to put a smooth glaze on the world\\nand to keep down all its realities. For whom everything must be\\nlanguid and pretty. Who have found out the perpetual stoppage. Who\\nare to rejoice at nothing and be sorry for nothing. Who are not to be\\ndisturbed by ideas. On whom even the fine arts, attending in powder\\nand walking backward like the Lord Chamberlain, must array themselves\\nin the milliners\\' and tailors\\' patterns of past generations and be\\nparticularly careful not to be in earnest or to receive any impress\\nfrom the moving age.\\n\\nThen there is my Lord Boodle, of considerable reputation with his\\nparty, who has known what office is and who tells Sir Leicester\\nDedlock with much gravity, after dinner, that he really does not see\\nto what the present age is tending. A debate is not what a debate\\nused to be; the House is not what the House used to be; even a\\nCabinet is not what it formerly was. He perceives with astonishment\\nthat supposing the present government to be overthrown, the limited\\nchoice of the Crown, in the formation of a new ministry, would lie\\nbetween Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle--supposing it to be\\nimpossible for the Duke of Foodle to act with Goodle, which may be\\nassumed to be the case in consequence of the breach arising out of\\nthat affair with Hoodle. Then, giving the Home Department and the\\nleadership of the House of Commons to Joodle, the Exchequer to\\nKoodle, the Colonies to Loodle, and the Foreign Office to Moodle,\\nwhat are you to do with Noodle? You can\\'t offer him the Presidency of\\nthe Council; that is reserved for Poodle. You can\\'t put him in the\\nWoods and Forests; that is hardly good enough for Quoodle. What\\nfollows? That the country is shipwrecked, lost, and gone to pieces\\n(as is made manifest to the patriotism of Sir Leicester Dedlock)\\nbecause you can\\'t provide for Noodle!\\n\\nOn the other hand, the Right Honourable William Buffy, M.P., contends\\nacross the table with some one else that the shipwreck of the\\ncountry--about which there is no doubt; it is only the manner of it\\nthat is in question--is attributable to Cuffy. If you had done with\\nCuffy what you ought to have done when he first came into Parliament,\\nand had prevented him from going over to Duffy, you would have got\\nhim into alliance with Fuffy, you would have had with you the weight\\nattaching as a smart debater to Guffy, you would have brought to bear\\nupon the elections the wealth of Huffy, you would have got in for\\nthree counties Juffy, Kuffy, and Luffy, and you would have\\nstrengthened your administration by the official knowledge and the\\nbusiness habits of Muffy. All this, instead of being as you now are,\\ndependent on the mere caprice of Puffy!\\n\\nAs to this point, and as to some minor topics, there are differences\\nof opinion; but it is perfectly clear to the brilliant and\\ndistinguished circle, all round, that nobody is in question but\\nBoodle and his retinue, and Buffy and HIS retinue. These are the\\ngreat actors for whom the stage is reserved. A People there are, no\\ndoubt--a certain large number of supernumeraries, who are to be\\noccasionally addressed, and relied upon for shouts and choruses, as\\non the theatrical stage; but Boodle and Buffy, their followers and\\nfamilies, their heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, are\\nthe born first-actors, managers, and leaders, and no others can\\nappear upon the scene for ever and ever.\\n\\nIn this, too, there is perhaps more dandyism at Chesney Wold than the\\nbrilliant and distinguished circle will find good for itself in the\\nlong run. For it is, even with the stillest and politest circles, as\\nwith the circle the necromancer draws around him--very strange\\nappearances may be seen in active motion outside. With this\\ndifference, that being realities and not phantoms, there is the\\ngreater danger of their breaking in.\\n\\nChesney Wold is quite full anyhow, so full that a burning sense of\\ninjury arises in the breasts of ill-lodged ladies\\'-maids, and is not\\nto be extinguished. Only one room is empty. It is a turret chamber of\\nthe third order of merit, plainly but comfortably furnished and\\nhaving an old-fashioned business air. It is Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s room,\\nand is never bestowed on anybody else, for he may come at any time.\\nHe is not come yet. It is his quiet habit to walk across the park\\nfrom the village in fine weather, to drop into this room as if he had\\nnever been out of it since he was last seen there, to request a\\nservant to inform Sir Leicester that he is arrived in case he should\\nbe wanted, and to appear ten minutes before dinner in the shadow of\\nthe library-door. He sleeps in his turret with a complaining\\nflag-staff over his head, and has some leads outside on which, any\\nfine morning when he is down here, his black figure may be seen\\nwalking before breakfast like a larger species of rook.\\n\\nEvery day before dinner, my Lady looks for him in the dusk of the\\nlibrary, but he is not there. Every day at dinner, my Lady glances\\ndown the table for the vacant place that would be waiting to receive\\nhim if he had just arrived, but there is no vacant place. Every night\\nmy Lady casually asks her maid, \"Is Mr. Tulkinghorn come?\"\\n\\nEvery night the answer is, \"No, my Lady, not yet.\"\\n\\nOne night, while having her hair undressed, my Lady loses herself in\\ndeep thought after this reply until she sees her own brooding face in\\nthe opposite glass, and a pair of black eyes curiously observing her.\\n\\n\"Be so good as to attend,\" says my Lady then, addressing the\\nreflection of Hortense, \"to your business. You can contemplate your\\nbeauty at another time.\"\\n\\n\"Pardon! It was your Ladyship\\'s beauty.\"\\n\\n\"That,\" says my Lady, \"you needn\\'t contemplate at all.\"\\n\\nAt length, one afternoon a little before sunset, when the bright\\ngroups of figures which have for the last hour or two enlivened the\\nGhost\\'s Walk are all dispersed and only Sir Leicester and my Lady\\nremain upon the terrace, Mr. Tulkinghorn appears. He comes towards\\nthem at his usual methodical pace, which is never quickened, never\\nslackened. He wears his usual expressionless mask--if it be a\\nmask--and carries family secrets in every limb of his body and every\\ncrease of his dress. Whether his whole soul is devoted to the great\\nor whether he yields them nothing beyond the services he sells is his\\npersonal secret. He keeps it, as he keeps the secrets of his clients;\\nhe is his own client in that matter, and will never betray himself.\\n\\n\"How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?\" says Sir Leicester, giving him his\\nhand.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn is quite well. Sir Leicester is quite well. My Lady\\nis quite well. All highly satisfactory. The lawyer, with his hands\\nbehind him, walks at Sir Leicester\\'s side along the terrace. My Lady\\nwalks upon the other side.\\n\\n\"We expected you before,\" says Sir Leicester. A gracious observation.\\nAs much as to say, \"Mr. Tulkinghorn, we remember your existence when\\nyou are not here to remind us of it by your presence. We bestow a\\nfragment of our minds upon you, sir, you see!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn, comprehending it, inclines his head and says he is\\nmuch obliged.\\n\\n\"I should have come down sooner,\" he explains, \"but that I have been\\nmuch engaged with those matters in the several suits between yourself\\nand Boythorn.\"\\n\\n\"A man of a very ill-regulated mind,\" observes Sir Leicester with\\nseverity. \"An extremely dangerous person in any community. A man of a\\nvery low character of mind.\"\\n\\n\"He is obstinate,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"It is natural to such a man to be so,\" says Sir Leicester, looking\\nmost profoundly obstinate himself. \"I am not at all surprised to hear\\nit.\"\\n\\n\"The only question is,\" pursues the lawyer, \"whether you will give up\\nanything.\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" replies Sir Leicester. \"Nothing. I give up?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mean anything of importance. That, of course, I know you\\nwould not abandon. I mean any minor point.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" returns Sir Leicester, \"there can be no minor\\npoint between myself and Mr. Boythorn. If I go farther, and observe\\nthat I cannot readily conceive how ANY right of mine can be a minor\\npoint, I speak not so much in reference to myself as an individual as\\nin reference to the family position I have it in charge to maintain.\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn inclines his head again. \"I have now my\\ninstructions,\" he says. \"Mr. Boythorn will give us a good deal of\\ntrouble--\"\\n\\n\"It is the character of such a mind, Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" Sir Leicester\\ninterrupts him, \"TO give trouble. An exceedingly ill-conditioned,\\nlevelling person. A person who, fifty years ago, would probably have\\nbeen tried at the Old Bailey for some demagogue proceeding, and\\nseverely punished--if not,\" adds Sir Leicester after a moment\\'s\\npause, \"if not hanged, drawn, and quartered.\"\\n\\nSir Leicester appears to discharge his stately breast of a burden in\\npassing this capital sentence, as if it were the next satisfactory\\nthing to having the sentence executed.\\n\\n\"But night is coming on,\" says he, \"and my Lady will take cold. My\\ndear, let us go in.\"\\n\\nAs they turn towards the hall-door, Lady Dedlock addresses Mr.\\nTulkinghorn for the first time.\\n\\n\"You sent me a message respecting the person whose writing I happened\\nto inquire about. It was like you to remember the circumstance; I had\\nquite forgotten it. Your message reminded me of it again. I can\\'t\\nimagine what association I had with a hand like that, but I surely\\nhad some.\"\\n\\n\"You had some?\" Mr. Tulkinghorn repeats.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" returns my Lady carelessly. \"I think I must have had some.\\nAnd did you really take the trouble to find out the writer of that\\nactual thing--what is it!--affidavit?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"How very odd!\"\\n\\nThey pass into a sombre breakfast-room on the ground floor, lighted\\nin the day by two deep windows. It is now twilight. The fire glows\\nbrightly on the panelled wall and palely on the window-glass, where,\\nthrough the cold reflection of the blaze, the colder landscape\\nshudders in the wind and a grey mist creeps along, the only traveller\\nbesides the waste of clouds.\\n\\nMy Lady lounges in a great chair in the chimney-corner, and Sir\\nLeicester takes another great chair opposite. The lawyer stands\\nbefore the fire with his hand out at arm\\'s length, shading his face.\\nHe looks across his arm at my Lady.\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he says, \"I inquired about the man, and found him. And, what\\nis very strange, I found him--\"\\n\\n\"Not to be any out-of-the-way person, I am afraid!\" Lady Dedlock\\nlanguidly anticipates.\\n\\n\"I found him dead.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear me!\" remonstrated Sir Leicester. Not so much shocked by the\\nfact as by the fact of the fact being mentioned.\\n\\n\"I was directed to his lodging--a miserable, poverty-stricken\\nplace--and I found him dead.\"\\n\\n\"You will excuse me, Mr. Tulkinghorn,\" observes Sir Leicester. \"I\\nthink the less said--\"\\n\\n\"Pray, Sir Leicester, let me hear the story out\" (it is my Lady\\nspeaking). \"It is quite a story for twilight. How very shocking!\\nDead?\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn re-asserts it by another inclination of his head.\\n\"Whether by his own hand--\"\\n\\n\"Upon my honour!\" cries Sir Leicester. \"Really!\"\\n\\n\"Do let me hear the story!\" says my Lady.\\n\\n\"Whatever you desire, my dear. But, I must say--\"\\n\\n\"No, you mustn\\'t say! Go on, Mr. Tulkinghorn.\"\\n\\nSir Leicester\\'s gallantry concedes the point, though he still feels\\nthat to bring this sort of squalor among the upper classes is\\nreally--really--\\n\\n\"I was about to say,\" resumes the lawyer with undisturbed calmness,\\n\"that whether he had died by his own hand or not, it was beyond my\\npower to tell you. I should amend that phrase, however, by saying\\nthat he had unquestionably died of his own act, though whether by his\\nown deliberate intention or by mischance can never certainly be\\nknown. The coroner\\'s jury found that he took the poison\\naccidentally.\"\\n\\n\"And what kind of man,\" my Lady asks, \"was this deplorable creature?\"\\n\\n\"Very difficult to say,\" returns the lawyer, shaking his head. \"He\\nhad lived so wretchedly and was so neglected, with his gipsy colour\\nand his wild black hair and beard, that I should have considered him\\nthe commonest of the common. The surgeon had a notion that he had\\nonce been something better, both in appearance and condition.\"\\n\\n\"What did they call the wretched being?\"\\n\\n\"They called him what he had called himself, but no one knew his\\nname.\"\\n\\n\"Not even any one who had attended on him?\"\\n\\n\"No one had attended on him. He was found dead. In fact, I found\\nhim.\"\\n\\n\"Without any clue to anything more?\"\\n\\n\"Without any; there was,\" says the lawyer meditatively, \"an old\\nportmanteau, but--No, there were no papers.\"\\n\\nDuring the utterance of every word of this short dialogue, Lady\\nDedlock and Mr. Tulkinghorn, without any other alteration in their\\ncustomary deportment, have looked very steadily at one another--as\\nwas natural, perhaps, in the discussion of so unusual a subject. Sir\\nLeicester has looked at the fire, with the general expression of the\\nDedlock on the staircase. The story being told, he renews his stately\\nprotest, saying that as it is quite clear that no association in my\\nLady\\'s mind can possibly be traceable to this poor wretch (unless he\\nwas a begging-letter writer), he trusts to hear no more about a\\nsubject so far removed from my Lady\\'s station.\\n\\n\"Certainly, a collection of horrors,\" says my Lady, gathering up her\\nmantles and furs, \"but they interest one for the moment! Have the\\nkindness, Mr. Tulkinghorn, to open the door for me.\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn does so with deference and holds it open while she\\npasses out. She passes close to him, with her usual fatigued manner\\nand insolent grace. They meet again at dinner--again, next\\nday--again, for many days in succession. Lady Dedlock is always the\\nsame exhausted deity, surrounded by worshippers, and terribly liable\\nto be bored to death, even while presiding at her own shrine. Mr.\\nTulkinghorn is always the same speechless repository of noble\\nconfidences, so oddly out of place and yet so perfectly at home. They\\nappear to take as little note of one another as any two people\\nenclosed within the same walls could. But whether each evermore\\nwatches and suspects the other, evermore mistrustful of some great\\nreservation; whether each is evermore prepared at all points for the\\nother, and never to be taken unawares; what each would give to know\\nhow much the other knows--all this is hidden, for the time, in their\\nown hearts.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe held many consultations about what Richard was to be, first\\nwithout Mr. Jarndyce, as he had requested, and afterwards with him,\\nbut it was a long time before we seemed to make progress. Richard\\nsaid he was ready for anything. When Mr. Jarndyce doubted whether he\\nmight not already be too old to enter the Navy, Richard said he had\\nthought of that, and perhaps he was. When Mr. Jarndyce asked him what\\nhe thought of the Army, Richard said he had thought of that, too, and\\nit wasn\\'t a bad idea. When Mr. Jarndyce advised him to try and decide\\nwithin himself whether his old preference for the sea was an ordinary\\nboyish inclination or a strong impulse, Richard answered, Well he\\nreally HAD tried very often, and he couldn\\'t make out.\\n\\n\"How much of this indecision of character,\" Mr. Jarndyce said to me,\\n\"is chargeable on that incomprehensible heap of uncertainty and\\nprocrastination on which he has been thrown from his birth, I don\\'t\\npretend to say; but that Chancery, among its other sins, is\\nresponsible for some of it, I can plainly see. It has engendered or\\nconfirmed in him a habit of putting off--and trusting to this, that,\\nand the other chance, without knowing what chance--and dismissing\\neverything as unsettled, uncertain, and confused. The character of\\nmuch older and steadier people may be even changed by the\\ncircumstances surrounding them. It would be too much to expect that a\\nboy\\'s, in its formation, should be the subject of such influences and\\nescape them.\"\\n\\nI felt this to be true; though if I may venture to mention what I\\nthought besides, I thought it much to be regretted that Richard\\'s\\neducation had not counteracted those influences or directed his\\ncharacter. He had been eight years at a public school and had learnt,\\nI understood, to make Latin verses of several sorts in the most\\nadmirable manner. But I never heard that it had been anybody\\'s\\nbusiness to find out what his natural bent was, or where his failings\\nlay, or to adapt any kind of knowledge to HIM. HE had been adapted to\\nthe verses and had learnt the art of making them to such perfection\\nthat if he had remained at school until he was of age, I suppose he\\ncould only have gone on making them over and over again unless he had\\nenlarged his education by forgetting how to do it. Still, although I\\nhad no doubt that they were very beautiful, and very improving, and\\nvery sufficient for a great many purposes of life, and always\\nremembered all through life, I did doubt whether Richard would not\\nhave profited by some one studying him a little, instead of his\\nstudying them quite so much.\\n\\nTo be sure, I knew nothing of the subject and do not even now know\\nwhether the young gentlemen of classic Rome or Greece made verses to\\nthe same extent--or whether the young gentlemen of any country ever\\ndid.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t the least idea,\" said Richard, musing, \"what I had better\\nbe. Except that I am quite sure I don\\'t want to go into the Church,\\nit\\'s a toss-up.\"\\n\\n\"You have no inclination in Mr. Kenge\\'s way?\" suggested Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know that, sir!\" replied Richard. \"I am fond of boating.\\nArticled clerks go a good deal on the water. It\\'s a capital\\nprofession!\"\\n\\n\"Surgeon--\" suggested Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the thing, sir!\" cried Richard.\\n\\nI doubt if he had ever once thought of it before.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the thing, sir,\" repeated Richard with the greatest\\nenthusiasm. \"We have got it at last. M.R.C.S.!\"\\n\\nHe was not to be laughed out of it, though he laughed at it heartily.\\nHe said he had chosen his profession, and the more he thought of it,\\nthe more he felt that his destiny was clear; the art of healing was\\nthe art of all others for him. Mistrusting that he only came to this\\nconclusion because, having never had much chance of finding out for\\nhimself what he was fitted for and having never been guided to the\\ndiscovery, he was taken by the newest idea and was glad to get rid of\\nthe trouble of consideration, I wondered whether the Latin verses\\noften ended in this or whether Richard\\'s was a solitary case.\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce took great pains to talk with him seriously and to put\\nit to his good sense not to deceive himself in so important a matter.\\nRichard was a little grave after these interviews, but invariably\\ntold Ada and me that it was all right, and then began to talk about\\nsomething else.\\n\\n\"By heaven!\" cried Mr. Boythorn, who interested himself strongly in\\nthe subject--though I need not say that, for he could do nothing\\nweakly; \"I rejoice to find a young gentleman of spirit and gallantry\\ndevoting himself to that noble profession! The more spirit there is\\nin it, the better for mankind and the worse for those mercenary\\ntask-masters and low tricksters who delight in putting that\\nillustrious art at a disadvantage in the world. By all that is base\\nand despicable,\" cried Mr. Boythorn, \"the treatment of surgeons\\naboard ship is such that I would submit the legs--both legs--of every\\nmember of the Admiralty Board to a compound fracture and render it a\\ntransportable offence in any qualified practitioner to set them if\\nthe system were not wholly changed in eight and forty hours!\"\\n\\n\"Wouldn\\'t you give them a week?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"No!\" cried Mr. Boythorn firmly. \"Not on any consideration! Eight and\\nforty hours! As to corporations, parishes, vestry-boards, and similar\\ngatherings of jolter-headed clods who assemble to exchange such\\nspeeches that, by heaven, they ought to be worked in quicksilver\\nmines for the short remainder of their miserable existence, if it\\nwere only to prevent their detestable English from contaminating a\\nlanguage spoken in the presence of the sun--as to those fellows, who\\nmeanly take advantage of the ardour of gentlemen in the pursuit of\\nknowledge to recompense the inestimable services of the best years of\\ntheir lives, their long study, and their expensive education with\\npittances too small for the acceptance of clerks, I would have the\\nnecks of every one of them wrung and their skulls arranged in\\nSurgeons\\' Hall for the contemplation of the whole profession in order\\nthat its younger members might understand from actual measurement, in\\nearly life, HOW thick skulls may become!\"\\n\\nHe wound up this vehement declaration by looking round upon us with a\\nmost agreeable smile and suddenly thundering, \"Ha, ha, ha!\" over and\\nover again, until anybody else might have been expected to be quite\\nsubdued by the exertion.\\n\\nAs Richard still continued to say that he was fixed in his choice\\nafter repeated periods for consideration had been recommended by Mr.\\nJarndyce and had expired, and he still continued to assure Ada and me\\nin the same final manner that it was \"all right,\" it became advisable\\nto take Mr. Kenge into council. Mr. Kenge, therefore, came down to\\ndinner one day, and leaned back in his chair, and turned his\\neye-glasses over and over, and spoke in a sonorous voice, and did\\nexactly what I remembered to have seen him do when I was a little\\ngirl.\\n\\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Yes. Well! A very good profession, Mr.\\nJarndyce, a very good profession.\"\\n\\n\"The course of study and preparation requires to be diligently\\npursued,\" observed my guardian with a glance at Richard.\\n\\n\"Oh, no doubt,\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Diligently.\"\\n\\n\"But that being the case, more or less, with all pursuits that are\\nworth much,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"it is not a special consideration\\nwhich another choice would be likely to escape.\"\\n\\n\"Truly,\" said Mr. Kenge. \"And Mr. Richard Carstone, who has so\\nmeritoriously acquitted himself in the--shall I say the classic\\nshades?--in which his youth had been passed, will, no doubt, apply\\nthe habits, if not the principles and practice, of versification in\\nthat tongue in which a poet was said (unless I mistake) to be born,\\nnot made, to the more eminently practical field of action on which he\\nenters.\"\\n\\n\"You may rely upon it,\" said Richard in his off-hand manner, \"that I\\nshall go at it and do my best.\"\\n\\n\"Very well, Mr. Jarndyce!\" said Mr. Kenge, gently nodding his head.\\n\"Really, when we are assured by Mr. Richard that he means to go at it\\nand to do his best,\" nodding feelingly and smoothly over those\\nexpressions, \"I would submit to you that we have only to inquire into\\nthe best mode of carrying out the object of his ambition. Now, with\\nreference to placing Mr. Richard with some sufficiently eminent\\npractitioner. Is there any one in view at present?\"\\n\\n\"No one, Rick, I think?\" said my guardian.\\n\\n\"No one, sir,\" said Richard.\\n\\n\"Quite so!\" observed Mr. Kenge. \"As to situation, now. Is there any\\nparticular feeling on that head?\"\\n\\n\"N--no,\" said Richard.\\n\\n\"Quite so!\" observed Mr. Kenge again.\\n\\n\"I should like a little variety,\" said Richard; \"I mean a good range\\nof experience.\"\\n\\n\"Very requisite, no doubt,\" returned Mr. Kenge. \"I think this may be\\neasily arranged, Mr. Jarndyce? We have only, in the first place, to\\ndiscover a sufficiently eligible practitioner; and as soon as we make\\nour want--and shall I add, our ability to pay a premium?--known, our\\nonly difficulty will be in the selection of one from a large number.\\nWe have only, in the second place, to observe those little\\nformalities which are rendered necessary by our time of life and our\\nbeing under the guardianship of the court. We shall soon be--shall I\\nsay, in Mr. Richard\\'s own light-hearted manner, \\'going at it\\'--to our\\nheart\\'s content. It is a coincidence,\" said Mr. Kenge with a tinge of\\nmelancholy in his smile, \"one of those coincidences which may or may\\nnot require an explanation beyond our present limited faculties, that\\nI have a cousin in the medical profession. He might be deemed\\neligible by you and might be disposed to respond to this proposal. I\\ncan answer for him as little as for you, but he MIGHT!\"\\n\\nAs this was an opening in the prospect, it was arranged that Mr.\\nKenge should see his cousin. And as Mr. Jarndyce had before proposed\\nto take us to London for a few weeks, it was settled next day that we\\nshould make our visit at once and combine Richard\\'s business with it.\\n\\nMr. Boythorn leaving us within a week, we took up our abode at a\\ncheerful lodging near Oxford Street over an upholsterer\\'s shop.\\nLondon was a great wonder to us, and we were out for hours and hours\\nat a time, seeing the sights, which appeared to be less capable of\\nexhaustion than we were. We made the round of the principal theatres,\\ntoo, with great delight, and saw all the plays that were worth\\nseeing. I mention this because it was at the theatre that I began to\\nbe made uncomfortable again by Mr. Guppy.\\n\\nI was sitting in front of the box one night with Ada, and Richard was\\nin the place he liked best, behind Ada\\'s chair, when, happening to\\nlook down into the pit, I saw Mr. Guppy, with his hair flattened down\\nupon his head and woe depicted in his face, looking up at me. I felt\\nall through the performance that he never looked at the actors but\\nconstantly looked at me, and always with a carefully prepared\\nexpression of the deepest misery and the profoundest dejection.\\n\\nIt quite spoiled my pleasure for that night because it was so very\\nembarrassing and so very ridiculous. But from that time forth, we\\nnever went to the play without my seeing Mr. Guppy in the pit, always\\nwith his hair straight and flat, his shirt-collar turned down, and a\\ngeneral feebleness about him. If he were not there when we went in,\\nand I began to hope he would not come and yielded myself for a little\\nwhile to the interest of the scene, I was certain to encounter his\\nlanguishing eyes when I least expected it and, from that time, to be\\nquite sure that they were fixed upon me all the evening.\\n\\nI really cannot express how uneasy this made me. If he would only\\nhave brushed up his hair or turned up his collar, it would have been\\nbad enough; but to know that that absurd figure was always gazing at\\nme, and always in that demonstrative state of despondency, put such a\\nconstraint upon me that I did not like to laugh at the play, or to\\ncry at it, or to move, or to speak. I seemed able to do nothing\\nnaturally. As to escaping Mr. Guppy by going to the back of the box,\\nI could not bear to do that because I knew Richard and Ada relied on\\nhaving me next them and that they could never have talked together so\\nhappily if anybody else had been in my place. So there I sat, not\\nknowing where to look--for wherever I looked, I knew Mr. Guppy\\'s eyes\\nwere following me--and thinking of the dreadful expense to which this\\nyoung man was putting himself on my account.\\n\\nSometimes I thought of telling Mr. Jarndyce. Then I feared that the\\nyoung man would lose his situation and that I might ruin him.\\nSometimes I thought of confiding in Richard, but was deterred by the\\npossibility of his fighting Mr. Guppy and giving him black eyes.\\nSometimes I thought, should I frown at him or shake my head. Then I\\nfelt I could not do it. Sometimes I considered whether I should write\\nto his mother, but that ended in my being convinced that to open a\\ncorrespondence would be to make the matter worse. I always came to\\nthe conclusion, finally, that I could do nothing. Mr. Guppy\\'s\\nperseverance, all this time, not only produced him regularly at any\\ntheatre to which we went, but caused him to appear in the crowd as we\\nwere coming out, and even to get up behind our fly--where I am sure I\\nsaw him, two or three times, struggling among the most dreadful\\nspikes. After we got home, he haunted a post opposite our house. The\\nupholsterer\\'s where we lodged being at the corner of two streets, and\\nmy bedroom window being opposite the post, I was afraid to go near\\nthe window when I went upstairs, lest I should see him (as I did one\\nmoonlight night) leaning against the post and evidently catching\\ncold. If Mr. Guppy had not been, fortunately for me, engaged in the\\ndaytime, I really should have had no rest from him.\\n\\nWhile we were making this round of gaieties, in which Mr. Guppy so\\nextraordinarily participated, the business which had helped to bring\\nus to town was not neglected. Mr. Kenge\\'s cousin was a Mr. Bayham\\nBadger, who had a good practice at Chelsea and attended a large\\npublic institution besides. He was quite willing to receive Richard\\ninto his house and to superintend his studies, and as it seemed that\\nthose could be pursued advantageously under Mr. Badger\\'s roof, and\\nMr. Badger liked Richard, and as Richard said he liked Mr. Badger\\n\"well enough,\" an agreement was made, the Lord Chancellor\\'s consent\\nwas obtained, and it was all settled.\\n\\nOn the day when matters were concluded between Richard and Mr.\\nBadger, we were all under engagement to dine at Mr. Badger\\'s house.\\nWe were to be \"merely a family party,\" Mrs. Badger\\'s note said; and\\nwe found no lady there but Mrs. Badger herself. She was surrounded in\\nthe drawing-room by various objects, indicative of her painting a\\nlittle, playing the piano a little, playing the guitar a little,\\nplaying the harp a little, singing a little, working a little,\\nreading a little, writing poetry a little, and botanizing a little.\\nShe was a lady of about fifty, I should think, youthfully dressed,\\nand of a very fine complexion. If I add to the little list of her\\naccomplishments that she rouged a little, I do not mean that there\\nwas any harm in it.\\n\\nMr. Bayham Badger himself was a pink, fresh-faced, crisp-looking\\ngentleman with a weak voice, white teeth, light hair, and surprised\\neyes, some years younger, I should say, than Mrs. Bayham Badger. He\\nadmired her exceedingly, but principally, and to begin with, on the\\ncurious ground (as it seemed to us) of her having had three husbands.\\nWe had barely taken our seats when he said to Mr. Jarndyce quite\\ntriumphantly, \"You would hardly suppose that I am Mrs. Bayham\\nBadger\\'s third!\"\\n\\n\"Indeed?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Her third!\" said Mr. Badger. \"Mrs. Bayham Badger has not the\\nappearance, Miss Summerson, of a lady who has had two former\\nhusbands?\"\\n\\nI said \"Not at all!\"\\n\\n\"And most remarkable men!\" said Mr. Badger in a tone of confidence.\\n\"Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy, who was Mrs. Badger\\'s first\\nhusband, was a very distinguished officer indeed. The name of\\nProfessor Dingo, my immediate predecessor, is one of European\\nreputation.\"\\n\\nMrs. Badger overheard him and smiled.\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear!\" Mr. Badger replied to the smile, \"I was observing to\\nMr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson that you had had two former\\nhusbands--both very distinguished men. And they found it, as people\\ngenerally do, difficult to believe.\"\\n\\n\"I was barely twenty,\" said Mrs. Badger, \"when I married Captain\\nSwosser of the Royal Navy. I was in the Mediterranean with him; I am\\nquite a sailor. On the twelfth anniversary of my wedding-day, I\\nbecame the wife of Professor Dingo.\"\\n\\n\"Of European reputation,\" added Mr. Badger in an undertone.\\n\\n\"And when Mr. Badger and myself were married,\" pursued Mrs. Badger,\\n\"we were married on the same day of the year. I had become attached\\nto the day.\"\\n\\n\"So that Mrs. Badger has been married to three husbands--two of them\\nhighly distinguished men,\" said Mr. Badger, summing up the facts,\\n\"and each time upon the twenty-first of March at eleven in the\\nforenoon!\"\\n\\nWe all expressed our admiration.\\n\\n\"But for Mr. Badger\\'s modesty,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"I would take\\nleave to correct him and say three distinguished men.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, Mr. Jarndyce! What I always tell him!\" observed Mrs.\\nBadger.\\n\\n\"And, my dear,\" said Mr. Badger, \"what do I always tell you? That\\nwithout any affectation of disparaging such professional distinction\\nas I may have attained (which our friend Mr. Carstone will have many\\nopportunities of estimating), I am not so weak--no, really,\" said Mr.\\nBadger to us generally, \"so unreasonable--as to put my reputation on\\nthe same footing with such first-rate men as Captain Swosser and\\nProfessor Dingo. Perhaps you may be interested, Mr. Jarndyce,\"\\ncontinued Mr. Bayham Badger, leading the way into the next\\ndrawing-room, \"in this portrait of Captain Swosser. It was taken on\\nhis return home from the African station, where he had suffered from\\nthe fever of the country. Mrs. Badger considers it too yellow. But\\nit\\'s a very fine head. A very fine head!\"\\n\\nWe all echoed, \"A very fine head!\"\\n\\n\"I feel when I look at it,\" said Mr. Badger, \"\\'That\\'s a man I should\\nlike to have seen!\\' It strikingly bespeaks the first-class man that\\nCaptain Swosser pre-eminently was. On the other side, Professor\\nDingo. I knew him well--attended him in his last illness--a speaking\\nlikeness! Over the piano, Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Swosser. Over\\nthe sofa, Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Dingo. Of Mrs. Bayham Badger\\nIN ESSE, I possess the original and have no copy.\"\\n\\nDinner was now announced, and we went downstairs. It was a very\\ngenteel entertainment, very handsomely served. But the captain and\\nthe professor still ran in Mr. Badger\\'s head, and as Ada and I had\\nthe honour of being under his particular care, we had the full\\nbenefit of them.\\n\\n\"Water, Miss Summerson? Allow me! Not in that tumbler, pray. Bring me\\nthe professor\\'s goblet, James!\"\\n\\nAda very much admired some artificial flowers under a glass.\\n\\n\"Astonishing how they keep!\" said Mr. Badger. \"They were presented to\\nMrs. Bayham Badger when she was in the Mediterranean.\"\\n\\nHe invited Mr. Jarndyce to take a glass of claret.\\n\\n\"Not that claret!\" he said. \"Excuse me! This is an occasion, and ON\\nan occasion I produce some very special claret I happen to have.\\n(James, Captain Swosser\\'s wine!) Mr. Jarndyce, this is a wine that\\nwas imported by the captain, we will not say how many years ago. You\\nwill find it very curious. My dear, I shall be happy to take some of\\nthis wine with you. (Captain Swosser\\'s claret to your mistress,\\nJames!) My love, your health!\"\\n\\nAfter dinner, when we ladies retired, we took Mrs. Badger\\'s first and\\nsecond husband with us. Mrs. Badger gave us in the drawing-room a\\nbiographical sketch of the life and services of Captain Swosser\\nbefore his marriage and a more minute account of him dating from the\\ntime when he fell in love with her at a ball on board the Crippler,\\ngiven to the officers of that ship when she lay in Plymouth Harbour.\\n\\n\"The dear old Crippler!\" said Mrs. Badger, shaking her head. \"She was\\na noble vessel. Trim, ship-shape, all a taunto, as Captain Swosser\\nused to say. You must excuse me if I occasionally introduce a\\nnautical expression; I was quite a sailor once. Captain Swosser loved\\nthat craft for my sake. When she was no longer in commission, he\\nfrequently said that if he were rich enough to buy her old hulk, he\\nwould have an inscription let into the timbers of the quarter-deck\\nwhere we stood as partners in the dance to mark the spot where he\\nfell--raked fore and aft (Captain Swosser used to say) by the fire\\nfrom my tops. It was his naval way of mentioning my eyes.\"\\n\\nMrs. Badger shook her head, sighed, and looked in the glass.\\n\\n\"It was a great change from Captain Swosser to Professor Dingo,\" she\\nresumed with a plaintive smile. \"I felt it a good deal at first. Such\\nan entire revolution in my mode of life! But custom, combined with\\nscience--particularly science--inured me to it. Being the professor\\'s\\nsole companion in his botanical excursions, I almost forgot that I\\nhad ever been afloat, and became quite learned. It is singular that\\nthe professor was the antipodes of Captain Swosser and that Mr.\\nBadger is not in the least like either!\"\\n\\nWe then passed into a narrative of the deaths of Captain Swosser and\\nProfessor Dingo, both of whom seem to have had very bad complaints.\\nIn the course of it, Mrs. Badger signified to us that she had never\\nmadly loved but once and that the object of that wild affection,\\nnever to be recalled in its fresh enthusiasm, was Captain Swosser.\\nThe professor was yet dying by inches in the most dismal manner, and\\nMrs. Badger was giving us imitations of his way of saying, with great\\ndifficulty, \"Where is Laura? Let Laura give me my toast and water!\"\\nwhen the entrance of the gentlemen consigned him to the tomb.\\n\\nNow, I observed that evening, as I had observed for some days past,\\nthat Ada and Richard were more than ever attached to each other\\'s\\nsociety, which was but natural, seeing that they were going to be\\nseparated so soon. I was therefore not very much surprised when we\\ngot home, and Ada and I retired upstairs, to find Ada more silent\\nthan usual, though I was not quite prepared for her coming into my\\narms and beginning to speak to me, with her face hidden.\\n\\n\"My darling Esther!\" murmured Ada. \"I have a great secret to tell\\nyou!\"\\n\\nA mighty secret, my pretty one, no doubt!\\n\\n\"What is it, Ada?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Esther, you would never guess!\"\\n\\n\"Shall I try to guess?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh, no! Don\\'t! Pray don\\'t!\" cried Ada, very much startled by the\\nidea of my doing so.\\n\\n\"Now, I wonder who it can be about?\" said I, pretending to consider.\\n\\n\"It\\'s about--\" said Ada in a whisper. \"It\\'s about--my cousin\\nRichard!\"\\n\\n\"Well, my own!\" said I, kissing her bright hair, which was all I\\ncould see. \"And what about him?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, Esther, you would never guess!\"\\n\\nIt was so pretty to have her clinging to me in that way, hiding her\\nface, and to know that she was not crying in sorrow but in a little\\nglow of joy, and pride, and hope, that I would not help her just yet.\\n\\n\"He says--I know it\\'s very foolish, we are both so young--but he\\nsays,\" with a burst of tears, \"that he loves me dearly, Esther.\"\\n\\n\"Does he indeed?\" said I. \"I never heard of such a thing! Why, my pet\\nof pets, I could have told you that weeks and weeks ago!\"\\n\\nTo see Ada lift up her flushed face in joyful surprise, and hold me\\nround the neck, and laugh, and cry, and blush, was so pleasant!\\n\\n\"Why, my darling,\" said I, \"what a goose you must take me for! Your\\ncousin Richard has been loving you as plainly as he could for I don\\'t\\nknow how long!\"\\n\\n\"And yet you never said a word about it!\" cried Ada, kissing me.\\n\\n\"No, my love,\" said I. \"I waited to be told.\"\\n\\n\"But now I have told you, you don\\'t think it wrong of me, do you?\"\\nreturned Ada. She might have coaxed me to say no if I had been the\\nhardest-hearted duenna in the world. Not being that yet, I said no\\nvery freely.\\n\\n\"And now,\" said I, \"I know the worst of it.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, that\\'s not quite the worst of it, Esther dear!\" cried Ada,\\nholding me tighter and laying down her face again upon my breast.\\n\\n\"No?\" said I. \"Not even that?\"\\n\\n\"No, not even that!\" said Ada, shaking her head.\\n\\n\"Why, you never mean to say--\" I was beginning in joke.\\n\\nBut Ada, looking up and smiling through her tears, cried, \"Yes, I do!\\nYou know, you know I do!\" And then sobbed out, \"With all my heart I\\ndo! With all my whole heart, Esther!\"\\n\\nI told her, laughing, why I had known that, too, just as well as I\\nhad known the other! And we sat before the fire, and I had all the\\ntalking to myself for a little while (though there was not much of\\nit); and Ada was soon quiet and happy.\\n\\n\"Do you think my cousin John knows, dear Dame Durden?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Unless my cousin John is blind, my pet,\" said I, \"I should think my\\ncousin John knows pretty well as much as we know.\"\\n\\n\"We want to speak to him before Richard goes,\" said Ada timidly, \"and\\nwe wanted you to advise us, and to tell him so. Perhaps you wouldn\\'t\\nmind Richard\\'s coming in, Dame Durden?\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Richard is outside, is he, my dear?\" said I.\\n\\n\"I am not quite certain,\" returned Ada with a bashful simplicity that\\nwould have won my heart if she had not won it long before, \"but I\\nthink he\\'s waiting at the door.\"\\n\\nThere he was, of course. They brought a chair on either side of me,\\nand put me between them, and really seemed to have fallen in love\\nwith me instead of one another, they were so confiding, and so\\ntrustful, and so fond of me. They went on in their own wild way for a\\nlittle while--I never stopped them; I enjoyed it too much myself--and\\nthen we gradually fell to considering how young they were, and how\\nthere must be a lapse of several years before this early love could\\ncome to anything, and how it could come to happiness only if it were\\nreal and lasting and inspired them with a steady resolution to do\\ntheir duty to each other, with constancy, fortitude, and\\nperseverance, each always for the other\\'s sake. Well! Richard said\\nthat he would work his fingers to the bone for Ada, and Ada said that\\nshe would work her fingers to the bone for Richard, and they called\\nme all sorts of endearing and sensible names, and we sat there,\\nadvising and talking, half the night. Finally, before we parted, I\\ngave them my promise to speak to their cousin John to-morrow.\\n\\nSo, when to-morrow came, I went to my guardian after breakfast, in\\nthe room that was our town-substitute for the growlery, and told him\\nthat I had it in trust to tell him something.\\n\\n\"Well, little woman,\" said he, shutting up his book, \"if you have\\naccepted the trust, there can be no harm in it.\"\\n\\n\"I hope not, guardian,\" said I. \"I can guarantee that there is no\\nsecrecy in it. For it only happened yesterday.\"\\n\\n\"Aye? And what is it, Esther?\"\\n\\n\"Guardian,\" said I, \"you remember the happy night when first we came\\ndown to Bleak House? When Ada was singing in the dark room?\"\\n\\nI wished to call to his remembrance the look he had given me then.\\nUnless I am much mistaken, I saw that I did so.\\n\\n\"Because--\" said I with a little hesitation.\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear!\" said he. \"Don\\'t hurry.\"\\n\\n\"Because,\" said I, \"Ada and Richard have fallen in love. And have\\ntold each other so.\"\\n\\n\"Already!\" cried my guardian, quite astonished.\\n\\n\"Yes!\" said I. \"And to tell you the truth, guardian, I rather\\nexpected it.\"\\n\\n\"The deuce you did!\" said he.\\n\\nHe sat considering for a minute or two, with his smile, at once so\\nhandsome and so kind, upon his changing face, and then requested me\\nto let them know that he wished to see them. When they came, he\\nencircled Ada with one arm in his fatherly way and addressed himself\\nto Richard with a cheerful gravity.\\n\\n\"Rick,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"I am glad to have won your confidence. I\\nhope to preserve it. When I contemplated these relations between us\\nfour which have so brightened my life and so invested it with new\\ninterests and pleasures, I certainly did contemplate, afar off, the\\npossibility of you and your pretty cousin here (don\\'t be shy, Ada,\\ndon\\'t be shy, my dear!) being in a mind to go through life together.\\nI saw, and do see, many reasons to make it desirable. But that was\\nafar off, Rick, afar off!\"\\n\\n\"We look afar off, sir,\" returned Richard.\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"That\\'s rational. Now, hear me, my dears!\\nI might tell you that you don\\'t know your own minds yet, that a\\nthousand things may happen to divert you from one another, that it is\\nwell this chain of flowers you have taken up is very easily broken,\\nor it might become a chain of lead. But I will not do that. Such\\nwisdom will come soon enough, I dare say, if it is to come at all. I\\nwill assume that a few years hence you will be in your hearts to one\\nanother what you are to-day. All I say before speaking to you\\naccording to that assumption is, if you DO change--if you DO come to\\nfind that you are more commonplace cousins to each other as man and\\nwoman than you were as boy and girl (your manhood will excuse me,\\nRick!)--don\\'t be ashamed still to confide in me, for there will be\\nnothing monstrous or uncommon in it. I am only your friend and\\ndistant kinsman. I have no power over you whatever. But I wish and\\nhope to retain your confidence if I do nothing to forfeit it.\"\\n\\n\"I am very sure, sir,\" returned Richard, \"that I speak for Ada too\\nwhen I say that you have the strongest power over us both--rooted in\\nrespect, gratitude, and affection--strengthening every day.\"\\n\\n\"Dear cousin John,\" said Ada, on his shoulder, \"my father\\'s place can\\nnever be empty again. All the love and duty I could ever have\\nrendered to him is transferred to you.\"\\n\\n\"Come!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"Now for our assumption. Now we lift our\\neyes up and look hopefully at the distance! Rick, the world is before\\nyou; and it is most probable that as you enter it, so it will receive\\nyou. Trust in nothing but in Providence and your own efforts. Never\\nseparate the two, like the heathen waggoner. Constancy in love is a\\ngood thing, but it means nothing, and is nothing, without constancy\\nin every kind of effort. If you had the abilities of all the great\\nmen, past and present, you could do nothing well without sincerely\\nmeaning it and setting about it. If you entertain the supposition\\nthat any real success, in great things or in small, ever was or could\\nbe, ever will or can be, wrested from Fortune by fits and starts,\\nleave that wrong idea here or leave your cousin Ada here.\"\\n\\n\"I will leave IT here, sir,\" replied Richard smiling, \"if I brought\\nit here just now (but I hope I did not), and will work my way on to\\nmy cousin Ada in the hopeful distance.\"\\n\\n\"Right!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"If you are not to make her happy, why\\nshould you pursue her?\"\\n\\n\"I wouldn\\'t make her unhappy--no, not even for her love,\" retorted\\nRichard proudly.\\n\\n\"Well said!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce. \"That\\'s well said! She remains here,\\nin her home with me. Love her, Rick, in your active life, no less\\nthan in her home when you revisit it, and all will go well.\\nOtherwise, all will go ill. That\\'s the end of my preaching. I think\\nyou and Ada had better take a walk.\"\\n\\nAda tenderly embraced him, and Richard heartily shook hands with him,\\nand then the cousins went out of the room, looking back again\\ndirectly, though, to say that they would wait for me.\\n\\nThe door stood open, and we both followed them with our eyes as they\\npassed down the adjoining room, on which the sun was shining, and out\\nat its farther end. Richard with his head bent, and her hand drawn\\nthrough his arm, was talking to her very earnestly; and she looked up\\nin his face, listening, and seemed to see nothing else. So young, so\\nbeautiful, so full of hope and promise, they went on lightly through\\nthe sunlight as their own happy thoughts might then be traversing the\\nyears to come and making them all years of brightness. So they passed\\naway into the shadow and were gone. It was only a burst of light that\\nhad been so radiant. The room darkened as they went out, and the sun\\nwas clouded over.\\n\\n\"Am I right, Esther?\" said my guardian when they were gone.\\n\\nHe was so good and wise to ask ME whether he was right!\\n\\n\"Rick may gain, out of this, the quality he wants. Wants, at the core\\nof so much that is good!\" said Mr. Jarndyce, shaking his head. \"I\\nhave said nothing to Ada, Esther. She has her friend and counsellor\\nalways near.\" And he laid his hand lovingly upon my head.\\n\\nI could not help showing that I was a little moved, though I did all\\nI could to conceal it.\\n\\n\"Tut tut!\" said he. \"But we must take care, too, that our little\\nwoman\\'s life is not all consumed in care for others.\"\\n\\n\"Care? My dear guardian, I believe I am the happiest creature in the\\nworld!\"\\n\\n\"I believe so, too,\" said he. \"But some one may find out what Esther\\nnever will--that the little woman is to be held in remembrance above\\nall other people!\"\\n\\nI have omitted to mention in its place that there was some one else\\nat the family dinner party. It was not a lady. It was a gentleman. It\\nwas a gentleman of a dark complexion--a young surgeon. He was rather\\nreserved, but I thought him very sensible and agreeable.

It touched me then to reflect, and it touches me now, more\\nnearly, to remember (having what I have to tell) how they both\\nthought of me, even at that engrossing time. I was a part of all\\ntheir plans, for the present and the future. I was to write Richard\\nonce a week, making my faithful report of Ada, who was to write to\\nhim every alternate day. I was to be informed, under his own hand, of\\nall his labours and successes; I was to observe how resolute and\\npersevering he would be; I was to be Ada\\'s bridesmaid when they were\\nmarried; I was to live with them afterwards; I was to keep all the\\nkeys of their house; I was to be made happy for ever and a day.\\n\\n\"And if the suit SHOULD make us rich, Esther--which it may, you\\nknow!\" said Richard to crown all.\\n\\nA shade crossed Ada\\'s face.\\n\\n\"My dearest Ada,\" asked Richard, \"why not?\"\\n\\n\"It had better declare us poor at once,\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"Oh! I don\\'t know about that,\" returned Richard, \"but at all events,\\nit won\\'t declare anything at once. It hasn\\'t declared anything in\\nheaven knows how many years.\"\\n\\n\"Too true,\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"Yes, but,\" urged Richard, answering what her look suggested rather\\nthan her words, \"the longer it goes on, dear cousin, the nearer it\\nmust be to a settlement one way or other. Now, is not that\\nreasonable?\"\\n\\n\"You know best, Richard. But I am afraid if we trust to it, it will\\nmake us unhappy.\"\\n\\n\"But, my Ada, we are not going to trust to it!\" cried Richard gaily.\\n\"We know it better than to trust to it. We only say that if it SHOULD\\nmake us rich, we have no constitutional objection to being rich. The\\ncourt is, by solemn settlement of law, our grim old guardian, and we\\nare to suppose that what it gives us (when it gives us anything) is\\nour right. It is not necessary to quarrel with our right.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said Ada, \"but it may be better to forget all about it.\"\\n\\n\"Well, well,\" cried Richard, \"then we will forget all about it! We\\nconsign the whole thing to oblivion. Dame Durden puts on her\\napproving face, and it\\'s done!\"\\n\\n\"Dame Durden\\'s approving face,\" said I, looking out of the box in\\nwhich I was packing his books, \"was not very visible when you called\\nit by that name; but it does approve, and she thinks you can\\'t do\\nbetter.\"\\n\\nSo, Richard said there was an end of it, and immediately began, on no\\nother foundation, to build as many castles in the air as would man\\nthe Great Wall of China. He went away in high spirits. Ada and I,\\nprepared to miss him very much, commenced our quieter career.\\n\\nOn our arrival in London, we had called with Mr. Jarndyce at Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s but had not been so fortunate as to find her at home. It\\nappeared that she had gone somewhere to a tea-drinking and had taken\\nMiss Jellyby with her. Besides the tea-drinking, there was to be some\\nconsiderable speech-making and letter-writing on the general merits\\nof the cultivation of coffee, conjointly with natives, at the\\nSettlement of Borrioboola-Gha. All this involved, no doubt,\\nsufficient active exercise of pen and ink to make her daughter\\'s part\\nin the proceedings anything but a holiday.\\n\\nIt being now beyond the time appointed for Mrs. Jellyby\\'s return, we\\ncalled again. She was in town, but not at home, having gone to Mile\\nEnd directly after breakfast on some Borrioboolan business, arising\\nout of a society called the East London Branch Aid Ramification. As I\\nhad not seen Peepy on the occasion of our last call (when he was not\\nto be found anywhere, and when the cook rather thought he must have\\nstrolled away with the dustman\\'s cart), I now inquired for him again.\\nThe oyster shells he had been building a house with were still in the\\npassage, but he was nowhere discoverable, and the cook supposed that\\nhe had \"gone after the sheep.\" When we repeated, with some surprise,\\n\"The sheep?\" she said, Oh, yes, on market days he sometimes followed\\nthem quite out of town and came back in such a state as never was!\\n\\nI was sitting at the window with my guardian on the following\\nmorning, and Ada was busy writing--of course to Richard--when Miss\\nJellyby was announced, and entered, leading the identical Peepy, whom\\nshe had made some endeavours to render presentable by wiping the dirt\\ninto corners of his face and hands and making his hair very wet and\\nthen violently frizzling it with her fingers. Everything the dear\\nchild wore was either too large for him or too small. Among his other\\ncontradictory decorations he had the hat of a bishop and the little\\ngloves of a baby. His boots were, on a small scale, the boots of a\\nploughman, while his legs, so crossed and recrossed with scratches\\nthat they looked like maps, were bare below a very short pair of\\nplaid drawers finished off with two frills of perfectly different\\npatterns. The deficient buttons on his plaid frock had evidently been\\nsupplied from one of Mr. Jellyby\\'s coats, they were so extremely\\nbrazen and so much too large. Most extraordinary specimens of\\nneedlework appeared on several parts of his dress, where it had been\\nhastily mended, and I recognized the same hand on Miss Jellyby\\'s. She\\nwas, however, unaccountably improved in her appearance and looked\\nvery pretty. She was conscious of poor little Peepy being but a\\nfailure after all her trouble, and she showed it as she came in by\\nthe way in which she glanced first at him and then at us.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear me!\" said my guardian. \"Due east!\"\\n\\nAda and I gave her a cordial welcome and presented her to Mr.\\nJarndyce, to whom she said as she sat down, \"Ma\\'s compliments, and\\nshe hopes you\\'ll excuse her, because she\\'s correcting proofs of the\\nplan. She\\'s going to put out five thousand new circulars, and she\\nknows you\\'ll be interested to hear that. I have brought one of them\\nwith me. Ma\\'s compliments.\" With which she presented it sulkily\\nenough.\\n\\n\"Thank you,\" said my guardian. \"I am much obliged to Mrs. Jellyby.\\nOh, dear me! This is a very trying wind!\"\\n\\nWe were busy with Peepy, taking off his clerical hat, asking him if\\nhe remembered us, and so on. Peepy retired behind his elbow at first,\\nbut relented at the sight of sponge-cake and allowed me to take him\\non my lap, where he sat munching quietly. Mr. Jarndyce then\\nwithdrawing into the temporary growlery, Miss Jellyby opened a\\nconversation with her usual abruptness.\\n\\n\"We are going on just as bad as ever in Thavies Inn,\" said she. \"I\\nhave no peace of my life. Talk of Africa! I couldn\\'t be worse off if\\nI was a what\\'s-his-name--man and a brother!\"\\n\\nI tried to say something soothing.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s of no use, Miss Summerson,\" exclaimed Miss Jellyby, \"though\\nI thank you for the kind intention all the same. I know how I am\\nused, and I am not to be talked over. YOU wouldn\\'t be talked over if\\nyou were used so. Peepy, go and play at Wild Beasts under the piano!\"\\n\\n\"I shan\\'t!\" said Peepy.\\n\\n\"Very well, you ungrateful, naughty, hard-hearted boy!\" returned Miss\\nJellyby with tears in her eyes. \"I\\'ll never take pains to dress you\\nany more.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I will go, Caddy!\" cried Peepy, who was really a good child and\\nwho was so moved by his sister\\'s vexation that he went at once.\\n\\n\"It seems a little thing to cry about,\" said poor Miss Jellyby\\napologetically, \"but I am quite worn out. I was directing the new\\ncirculars till two this morning. I detest the whole thing so that\\nthat alone makes my head ache till I can\\'t see out of my eyes. And\\nlook at that poor unfortunate child! Was there ever such a fright as\\nhe is!\"\\n\\nPeepy, happily unconscious of the defects in his appearance, sat on\\nthe carpet behind one of the legs of the piano, looking calmly out of\\nhis den at us while he ate his cake.\\n\\n\"I have sent him to the other end of the room,\" observed Miss\\nJellyby, drawing her chair nearer ours, \"because I don\\'t want him to\\nhear the conversation. Those little things are so sharp! I was going\\nto say, we really are going on worse than ever. Pa will be a bankrupt\\nbefore long, and then I hope Ma will be satisfied. There\\'ll he nobody\\nbut Ma to thank for it.\"\\n\\nWe said we hoped Mr. Jellyby\\'s affairs were not in so bad a state as\\nthat.\\n\\n\"It\\'s of no use hoping, though it\\'s very kind of you,\" returned Miss\\nJellyby, shaking her head. \"Pa told me only yesterday morning (and\\ndreadfully unhappy he is) that he couldn\\'t weather the storm. I\\nshould be surprised if he could. When all our tradesmen send into our\\nhouse any stuff they like, and the servants do what they like with\\nit, and I have no time to improve things if I knew how, and Ma don\\'t\\ncare about anything, I should like to make out how Pa is to weather\\nthe storm. I declare if I was Pa, I\\'d run away.\"\\n\\n\"My dear!\" said I, smiling. \"Your papa, no doubt, considers his\\nfamily.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, his family is all very fine, Miss Summerson,\" replied Miss\\nJellyby; \"but what comfort is his family to him? His family is\\nnothing but bills, dirt, waste, noise, tumbles downstairs, confusion,\\nand wretchedness. His scrambling home, from week\\'s end to week\\'s end,\\nis like one great washing-day--only nothing\\'s washed!\"\\n\\nMiss Jellyby tapped her foot upon the floor and wiped her eyes.\\n\\n\"I am sure I pity Pa to that degree,\" she said, \"and am so angry with\\nMa that I can\\'t find words to express myself! However, I am not going\\nto bear it, I am determined. I won\\'t be a slave all my life, and I\\nwon\\'t submit to be proposed to by Mr. Quale. A pretty thing, indeed,\\nto marry a philanthropist. As if I hadn\\'t had enough of THAT!\" said\\npoor Miss Jellyby.\\n\\nI must confess that I could not help feeling rather angry with Mrs.\\nJellyby myself, seeing and hearing this neglected girl and knowing\\nhow much of bitterly satirical truth there was in what she said.\\n\\n\"If it wasn\\'t that we had been intimate when you stopped at our\\nhouse,\" pursued Miss Jellyby, \"I should have been ashamed to come\\nhere to-day, for I know what a figure I must seem to you two. But as\\nit is, I made up my mind to call, especially as I am not likely to\\nsee you again the next time you come to town.\"\\n\\nShe said this with such great significance that Ada and I glanced at\\none another, foreseeing something more.\\n\\n\"No!\" said Miss Jellyby, shaking her head. \"Not at all likely! I know\\nI may trust you two. I am sure you won\\'t betray me. I am engaged.\"\\n\\n\"Without their knowledge at home?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Why, good gracious me, Miss Summerson,\" she returned, justifying\\nherself in a fretful but not angry manner, \"how can it be otherwise?\\nYou know what Ma is--and I needn\\'t make poor Pa more miserable by\\ntelling HIM.\"\\n\\n\"But would it not be adding to his unhappiness to marry without his\\nknowledge or consent, my dear?\" said I.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Miss Jellyby, softening. \"I hope not. I should try to make\\nhim happy and comfortable when he came to see me, and Peepy and the\\nothers should take it in turns to come and stay with me, and they\\nshould have some care taken of them then.\"\\n\\nThere was a good deal of affection in poor Caddy. She softened more\\nand more while saying this and cried so much over the unwonted little\\nhome-picture she had raised in her mind that Peepy, in his cave under\\nthe piano, was touched, and turned himself over on his back with loud\\nlamentations. It was not until I had brought him to kiss his sister,\\nand had restored him to his place on my lap, and had shown him that\\nCaddy was laughing (she laughed expressly for the purpose), that we\\ncould recall his peace of mind; even then it was for some time\\nconditional on his taking us in turns by the chin and smoothing our\\nfaces all over with his hand. At last, as his spirits were not equal\\nto the piano, we put him on a chair to look out of window; and Miss\\nJellyby, holding him by one leg, resumed her confidence.\\n\\n\"It began in your coming to our house,\" she said.\\n\\nWe naturally asked how.\\n\\n\"I felt I was so awkward,\" she replied, \"that I made up my mind to be\\nimproved in that respect at all events and to learn to dance. I told\\nMa I was ashamed of myself, and I must be taught to dance. Ma looked\\nat me in that provoking way of hers as if I wasn\\'t in sight, but I\\nwas quite determined to be taught to dance, and so I went to Mr.\\nTurveydrop\\'s Academy in Newman Street.\"\\n\\n\"And was it there, my dear--\" I began.\\n\\n\"Yes, it was there,\" said Caddy, \"and I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop.\\nThere are two Mr. Turveydrops, father and son. My Mr. Turveydrop is\\nthe son, of course. I only wish I had been better brought up and was\\nlikely to make him a better wife, for I am very fond of him.\"\\n\\n\"I am sorry to hear this,\" said I, \"I must confess.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know why you should be sorry,\" she retorted a little\\nanxiously, \"but I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop, whether or no, and he\\nis very fond of me. It\\'s a secret as yet, even on his side, because\\nold Mr. Turveydrop has a share in the connexion and it might break\\nhis heart or give him some other shock if he was told of it abruptly.\\nOld Mr. Turveydrop is a very gentlemanly man indeed--very\\ngentlemanly.\"\\n\\n\"Does his wife know of it?\" asked Ada.\\n\\n\"Old Mr. Turveydrop\\'s wife, Miss Clare?\" returned Miss Jellyby,\\nopening her eyes. \"There\\'s no such person. He is a widower.\"\\n\\nWe were here interrupted by Peepy, whose leg had undergone so much on\\naccount of his sister\\'s unconsciously jerking it like a bell-rope\\nwhenever she was emphatic that the afflicted child now bemoaned his\\nsufferings with a very low-spirited noise. As he appealed to me for\\ncompassion, and as I was only a listener, I undertook to hold him.\\nMiss Jellyby proceeded, after begging Peepy\\'s pardon with a kiss and\\nassuring him that she hadn\\'t meant to do it.\\n\\n\"That\\'s the state of the case,\" said Caddy. \"If I ever blame myself,\\nI still think it\\'s Ma\\'s fault. We are to be married whenever we can,\\nand then I shall go to Pa at the office and write to Ma. It won\\'t\\nmuch agitate Ma; I am only pen and ink to HER. One great comfort is,\"\\nsaid Caddy with a sob, \"that I shall never hear of Africa after I am\\nmarried. Young Mr. Turveydrop hates it for my sake, and if old Mr.\\nTurveydrop knows there is such a place, it\\'s as much as he does.\"\\n\\n\"It was he who was very gentlemanly, I think!\" said I.\\n\\n\"Very gentlemanly indeed,\" said Caddy. \"He is celebrated almost\\neverywhere for his deportment.\"\\n\\n\"Does he teach?\" asked Ada.\\n\\n\"No, he don\\'t teach anything in particular,\" replied Caddy. \"But his\\ndeportment is beautiful.\"\\n\\nCaddy went on to say with considerable hesitation and reluctance that\\nthere was one thing more she wished us to know, and felt we ought to\\nknow, and which she hoped would not offend us. It was that she had\\nimproved her acquaintance with Miss Flite, the little crazy old lady,\\nand that she frequently went there early in the morning and met her\\nlover for a few minutes before breakfast--only for a few minutes. \"I\\ngo there at other times,\" said Caddy, \"but Prince does not come then.\\nYoung Mr. Turveydrop\\'s name is Prince; I wish it wasn\\'t, because it\\nsounds like a dog, but of course he didn\\'t christen himself. Old Mr.\\nTurveydrop had him christened Prince in remembrance of the Prince\\nRegent. Old Mr. Turveydrop adored the Prince Regent on account of his\\ndeportment. I hope you won\\'t think the worse of me for having made\\nthese little appointments at Miss Flite\\'s, where I first went with\\nyou, because I like the poor thing for her own sake and I believe she\\nlikes me. If you could see young Mr. Turveydrop, I am sure you would\\nthink well of him--at least, I am sure you couldn\\'t possibly think\\nany ill of him. I am going there now for my lesson. I couldn\\'t ask\\nyou to go with me, Miss Summerson; but if you would,\" said Caddy, who\\nhad said all this earnestly and tremblingly, \"I should be very\\nglad--very glad.\"\\n\\nIt happened that we had arranged with my guardian to go to Miss\\nFlite\\'s that day. We had told him of our former visit, and our\\naccount had interested him; but something had always happened to\\nprevent our going there again. As I trusted that I might have\\nsufficient influence with Miss Jellyby to prevent her taking any very\\nrash step if I fully accepted the confidence she was so willing to\\nplace in me, poor girl, I proposed that she and I and Peepy should go\\nto the academy and afterwards meet my guardian and Ada at Miss\\nFlite\\'s, whose name I now learnt for the first time. This was on\\ncondition that Miss Jellyby and Peepy should come back with us to\\ndinner. The last article of the agreement being joyfully acceded to\\nby both, we smartened Peepy up a little with the assistance of a few\\npins, some soap and water, and a hair-brush, and went out, bending\\nour steps towards Newman Street, which was very near.\\n\\nI found the academy established in a sufficiently dingy house at the\\ncorner of an archway, with busts in all the staircase windows. In the\\nsame house there were also established, as I gathered from the plates\\non the door, a drawing-master, a coal-merchant (there was, certainly,\\nno room for his coals), and a lithographic artist. On the plate\\nwhich, in size and situation, took precedence of all the rest, I\\nread, MR. TURVEYDROP. The door was open, and the hall was blocked up\\nby a grand piano, a harp, and several other musical instruments in\\ncases, all in progress of removal, and all looking rakish in the\\ndaylight. Miss Jellyby informed me that the academy had been lent,\\nlast night, for a concert.\\n\\nWe went upstairs--it had been quite a fine house once, when it was\\nanybody\\'s business to keep it clean and fresh, and nobody\\'s business\\nto smoke in it all day--and into Mr. Turveydrop\\'s great room, which\\nwas built out into a mews at the back and was lighted by a skylight.\\nIt was a bare, resounding room smelling of stables, with cane forms\\nalong the walls, and the walls ornamented at regular intervals with\\npainted lyres and little cut-glass branches for candles, which seemed\\nto be shedding their old-fashioned drops as other branches might shed\\nautumn leaves. Several young lady pupils, ranging from thirteen or\\nfourteen years of age to two or three and twenty, were assembled; and\\nI was looking among them for their instructor when Caddy, pinching my\\narm, repeated the ceremony of introduction. \"Miss Summerson, Mr.\\nPrince Turveydrop!\"\\n\\nI curtsied to a little blue-eyed fair man of youthful appearance with\\nflaxen hair parted in the middle and curling at the ends all round\\nhis head. He had a little fiddle, which we used to call at school a\\nkit, under his left arm, and its little bow in the same hand. His\\nlittle dancing-shoes were particularly diminutive, and he had a\\nlittle innocent, feminine manner which not only appealed to me in an\\namiable way, but made this singular effect upon me, that I received\\nthe impression that he was like his mother and that his mother had\\nnot been much considered or well used.\\n\\n\"I am very happy to see Miss Jellyby\\'s friend,\" he said, bowing low\\nto me. \"I began to fear,\" with timid tenderness, \"as it was past the\\nusual time, that Miss Jellyby was not coming.\"\\n\\n\"I beg you will have the goodness to attribute that to me, who have\\ndetained her, and to receive my excuses, sir,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear!\" said he.\\n\\n\"And pray,\" I entreated, \"do not allow me to be the cause of any more\\ndelay.\"\\n\\nWith that apology I withdrew to a seat between Peepy (who, being well\\nused to it, had already climbed into a corner place) and an old lady\\nof a censorious countenance whose two nieces were in the class and\\nwho was very indignant with Peepy\\'s boots. Prince Turveydrop then\\ntinkled the strings of his kit with his fingers, and the young ladies\\nstood up to dance. Just then there appeared from a side-door old Mr.\\nTurveydrop, in the full lustre of his deportment.\\n\\nHe was a fat old gentleman with a false complexion, false teeth,\\nfalse whiskers, and a wig. He had a fur collar, and he had a padded\\nbreast to his coat, which only wanted a star or a broad blue ribbon\\nto be complete. He was pinched in, and swelled out, and got up, and\\nstrapped down, as much as he could possibly bear. He had such a\\nneckcloth on (puffing his very eyes out of their natural shape), and\\nhis chin and even his ears so sunk into it, that it seemed as though\\nhe must inevitably double up if it were cast loose. He had under his\\narm a hat of great size and weight, shelving downward from the crown\\nto the brim, and in his hand a pair of white gloves with which he\\nflapped it as he stood poised on one leg in a high-shouldered,\\nround-elbowed state of elegance not to be surpassed. He had a cane,\\nhe had an eye-glass, he had a snuff-box, he had rings, he had\\nwristbands, he had everything but any touch of nature; he was not\\nlike youth, he was not like age, he was not like anything in the\\nworld but a model of deportment.\\n\\n\"Father! A visitor. Miss Jellyby\\'s friend, Miss Summerson.\"\\n\\n\"Distinguished,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"by Miss Summerson\\'s presence.\"\\nAs he bowed to me in that tight state, I almost believe I saw creases\\ncome into the whites of his eyes.\\n\\n\"My father,\" said the son, aside, to me with quite an affecting\\nbelief in him, \"is a celebrated character. My father is greatly\\nadmired.\"\\n\\n\"Go on, Prince! Go on!\" said Mr. Turveydrop, standing with his back\\nto the fire and waving his gloves condescendingly. \"Go on, my son!\"\\n\\nAt this command, or by this gracious permission, the lesson went on.\\nPrince Turveydrop sometimes played the kit, dancing; sometimes played\\nthe piano, standing; sometimes hummed the tune with what little\\nbreath he could spare, while he set a pupil right; always\\nconscientiously moved with the least proficient through every step\\nand every part of the figure; and never rested for an instant. His\\ndistinguished father did nothing whatever but stand before the fire,\\na model of deportment.\\n\\n\"And he never does anything else,\" said the old lady of the\\ncensorious countenance. \"Yet would you believe that it\\'s HIS name on\\nthe door-plate?\"\\n\\n\"His son\\'s name is the same, you know,\" said I.\\n\\n\"He wouldn\\'t let his son have any name if he could take it from him,\"\\nreturned the old lady. \"Look at the son\\'s dress!\" It certainly was\\nplain--threadbare--almost shabby. \"Yet the father must be garnished\\nand tricked out,\" said the old lady, \"because of his deportment. I\\'d\\ndeport him! Transport him would be better!\"\\n\\nI felt curious to know more concerning this person. I asked, \"Does he\\ngive lessons in deportment now?\"\\n\\n\"Now!\" returned the old lady shortly. \"Never did.\"\\n\\nAfter a moment\\'s consideration, I suggested that perhaps fencing had\\nbeen his accomplishment.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t believe he can fence at all, ma\\'am,\" said the old lady.\\n\\nI looked surprised and inquisitive. The old lady, becoming more and\\nmore incensed against the master of deportment as she dwelt upon the\\nsubject, gave me some particulars of his career, with strong\\nassurances that they were mildly stated.\\n\\nHe had married a meek little dancing-mistress, with a tolerable\\nconnexion (having never in his life before done anything but deport\\nhimself), and had worked her to death, or had, at the best, suffered\\nher to work herself to death, to maintain him in those expenses which\\nwere indispensable to his position. At once to exhibit his deportment\\nto the best models and to keep the best models constantly before\\nhimself, he had found it necessary to frequent all public places of\\nfashionable and lounging resort, to be seen at Brighton and elsewhere\\nat fashionable times, and to lead an idle life in the very best\\nclothes. To enable him to do this, the affectionate little\\ndancing-mistress had toiled and laboured and would have toiled and\\nlaboured to that hour if her strength had lasted so long. For the\\nmainspring of the story was that in spite of the man\\'s absorbing\\nselfishness, his wife (overpowered by his deportment) had, to the\\nlast, believed in him and had, on her death-bed, in the most moving\\nterms, confided him to their son as one who had an inextinguishable\\nclaim upon him and whom he could never regard with too much pride and\\ndeference. The son, inheriting his mother\\'s belief, and having the\\ndeportment always before him, had lived and grown in the same faith,\\nand now, at thirty years of age, worked for his father twelve hours a\\nday and looked up to him with veneration on the old imaginary\\npinnacle.\\n\\n\"The airs the fellow gives himself!\" said my informant, shaking her\\nhead at old Mr. Turveydrop with speechless indignation as he drew on\\nhis tight gloves, of course unconscious of the homage she was\\nrendering. \"He fully believes he is one of the aristocracy! And he is\\nso condescending to the son he so egregiously deludes that you might\\nsuppose him the most virtuous of parents. Oh!\" said the old lady,\\napostrophizing him with infinite vehemence. \"I could bite you!\"\\n\\nI could not help being amused, though I heard the old lady out with\\nfeelings of real concern. It was difficult to doubt her with the\\nfather and son before me. What I might have thought of them without\\nthe old lady\\'s account, or what I might have thought of the old\\nlady\\'s account without them, I cannot say. There was a fitness of\\nthings in the whole that carried conviction with it.\\n\\nMy eyes were yet wandering, from young Mr. Turveydrop working so\\nhard, to old Mr. Turveydrop deporting himself so beautifully, when\\nthe latter came ambling up to me and entered into conversation.\\n\\nHe asked me, first of all, whether I conferred a charm and a\\ndistinction on London by residing in it? I did not think it necessary\\nto reply that I was perfectly aware I should not do that, in any\\ncase, but merely told him where I did reside.\\n\\n\"A lady so graceful and accomplished,\" he said, kissing his\\nright glove and afterwards extending it towards the pupils,\\n\"will look leniently on the deficiencies here. We do our best to\\npolish--polish--polish!\"\\n\\nHe sat down beside me, taking some pains to sit on the form, I\\nthought, in imitation of the print of his illustrious model on the\\nsofa. And really he did look very like it.\\n\\n\"To polish--polish--polish!\" he repeated, taking a pinch of snuff and\\ngently fluttering his fingers. \"But we are not, if I may say so to\\none formed to be graceful both by Nature and Art--\" with the\\nhigh-shouldered bow, which it seemed impossible for him to make\\nwithout lifting up his eyebrows and shutting his eyes \"--we are not\\nwhat we used to be in point of deportment.\"\\n\\n\"Are we not, sir?\" said I.\\n\\n\"We have degenerated,\" he returned, shaking his head, which he could\\ndo to a very limited extent in his cravat. \"A levelling age is not\\nfavourable to deportment. It develops vulgarity. Perhaps I speak with\\nsome little partiality. It may not be for me to say that I have been\\ncalled, for some years now, Gentleman Turveydrop, or that his Royal\\nHighness the Prince Regent did me the honour to inquire, on my\\nremoving my hat as he drove out of the Pavilion at Brighton (that\\nfine building), \\'Who is he? Who the devil is he? Why don\\'t I know\\nhim? Why hasn\\'t he thirty thousand a year?\\' But these are little\\nmatters of anecdote--the general property, ma\\'am--still repeated\\noccasionally among the upper classes.\"\\n\\n\"Indeed?\" said I.\\n\\nHe replied with the high-shouldered bow. \"Where what is left among us\\nof deportment,\" he added, \"still lingers. England--alas, my\\ncountry!--has degenerated very much, and is degenerating every day.\\nShe has not many gentlemen left. We are few. I see nothing to succeed\\nus but a race of weavers.\"\\n\\n\"One might hope that the race of gentlemen would be perpetuated\\nhere,\" said I.\\n\\n\"You are very good.\" He smiled with a high-shouldered bow again. \"You\\nflatter me. But, no--no! I have never been able to imbue my poor boy\\nwith that part of his art. Heaven forbid that I should disparage my\\ndear child, but he has--no deportment.\"\\n\\n\"He appears to be an excellent master,\" I observed.\\n\\n\"Understand me, my dear madam, he IS an excellent master. All that\\ncan be acquired, he has acquired. All that can be imparted, he can\\nimpart. But there ARE things--\" He took another pinch of snuff and\\nmade the bow again, as if to add, \"This kind of thing, for instance.\"\\n\\nI glanced towards the centre of the room, where Miss Jellyby\\'s lover,\\nnow engaged with single pupils, was undergoing greater drudgery than\\never.\\n\\n\"My amiable child,\" murmured Mr. Turveydrop, adjusting his cravat.\\n\\n\"Your son is indefatigable,\" said I.\\n\\n\"It is my reward,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, \"to hear you say so. In some\\nrespects, he treads in the footsteps of his sainted mother. She was a\\ndevoted creature. But wooman, lovely wooman,\" said Mr. Turveydrop\\nwith very disagreeable gallantry, \"what a sex you are!\"\\n\\nI rose and joined Miss Jellyby, who was by this time putting on her\\nbonnet. The time allotted to a lesson having fully elapsed, there was\\na general putting on of bonnets. When Miss Jellyby and the\\nunfortunate Prince found an opportunity to become betrothed I don\\'t\\nknow, but they certainly found none on this occasion to exchange a\\ndozen words.\\n\\n\"My dear,\" said Mr. Turveydrop benignly to his son, \"do you know the\\nhour?\"\\n\\n\"No, father.\" The son had no watch. The father had a handsome gold\\none, which he pulled out with an air that was an example to mankind.\\n\\n\"My son,\" said he, \"it\\'s two o\\'clock. Recollect your school at\\nKensington at three.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s time enough for me, father,\" said Prince. \"I can take a\\nmorsel of dinner standing and be off.\"\\n\\n\"My dear boy,\" returned his father, \"you must be very quick. You will\\nfind the cold mutton on the table.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, father. Are YOU off now, father?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my dear. I suppose,\" said Mr. Turveydrop, shutting his eyes and\\nlifting up his shoulders with modest consciousness, \"that I must show\\nmyself, as usual, about town.\"\\n\\n\"You had better dine out comfortably somewhere,\" said his son.\\n\\n\"My dear child, I intend to. I shall take my little meal, I think, at\\nthe French house, in the Opera Colonnade.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right. Good-bye, father!\" said Prince, shaking hands.\\n\\n\"Good-bye, my son. Bless you!\"\\n\\nMr. Turveydrop said this in quite a pious manner, and it seemed to do\\nhis son good, who, in parting from him, was so pleased with him, so\\ndutiful to him, and so proud of him that I almost felt as if it were\\nan unkindness to the younger man not to be able to believe implicitly\\nin the elder. The few moments that were occupied by Prince in taking\\nleave of us (and particularly of one of us, as I saw, being in the\\nsecret), enhanced my favourable impression of his almost childish\\ncharacter. I felt a liking for him and a compassion for him as he put\\nhis little kit in his pocket--and with it his desire to stay a little\\nwhile with Caddy--and went away good-humouredly to his cold mutton\\nand his school at Kensington, that made me scarcely less irate with\\nhis father than the censorious old lady.\\n\\nThe father opened the room door for us and bowed us out in a manner,\\nI must acknowledge, worthy of his shining original. In the same style\\nhe presently passed us on the other side of the street, on his way to\\nthe aristocratic part of the town, where he was going to show himself\\namong the few other gentlemen left. For some moments, I was so lost\\nin reconsidering what I had heard and seen in Newman Street that I\\nwas quite unable to talk to Caddy or even to fix my attention on what\\nshe said to me, especially when I began to inquire in my mind whether\\nthere were, or ever had been, any other gentlemen, not in the dancing\\nprofession, who lived and founded a reputation entirely on their\\ndeportment. This became so bewildering and suggested the possibility\\nof so many Mr. Turveydrops that I said, \"Esther, you must make up\\nyour mind to abandon this subject altogether and attend to Caddy.\" I\\naccordingly did so, and we chatted all the rest of the way to\\nLincoln\\'s Inn.\\n\\nCaddy told me that her lover\\'s education had been so neglected that\\nit was not always easy to read his notes. She said if he were not so\\nanxious about his spelling and took less pains to make it clear, he\\nwould do better; but he put so many unnecessary letters into short\\nwords that they sometimes quite lost their English appearance. \"He\\ndoes it with the best intention,\" observed Caddy, \"but it hasn\\'t the\\neffect he means, poor fellow!\" Caddy then went on to reason, how\\ncould he be expected to be a scholar when he had passed his whole\\nlife in the dancing-school and had done nothing but teach and fag,\\nfag and teach, morning, noon, and night! And what did it matter? She\\ncould write letters enough for both, as she knew to her cost, and it\\nwas far better for him to be amiable than learned. \"Besides, it\\'s not\\nas if I was an accomplished girl who had any right to give herself\\nairs,\" said Caddy. \"I know little enough, I am sure, thanks to Ma!\\n\\n\"There\\'s another thing I want to tell you, now we are alone,\"\\ncontinued Caddy, \"which I should not have liked to mention unless you\\nhad seen Prince, Miss Summerson. You know what a house ours is. It\\'s\\nof no use my trying to learn anything that it would be useful for\\nPrince\\'s wife to know in OUR house. We live in such a state of muddle\\nthat it\\'s impossible, and I have only been more disheartened whenever\\nI have tried. So I get a little practice with--who do you think? Poor\\nMiss Flite! Early in the morning I help her to tidy her room and\\nclean her birds, and I make her cup of coffee for her (of course she\\ntaught me), and I have learnt to make it so well that Prince says\\nit\\'s the very best coffee he ever tasted, and would quite delight old\\nMr. Turveydrop, who is very particular indeed about his coffee. I can\\nmake little puddings too; and I know how to buy neck of mutton, and\\ntea, and sugar, and butter, and a good many housekeeping things. I am\\nnot clever at my needle, yet,\" said Caddy, glancing at the repairs on\\nPeepy\\'s frock, \"but perhaps I shall improve, and since I have been\\nengaged to Prince and have been doing all this, I have felt\\nbetter-tempered, I hope, and more forgiving to Ma. It rather put me\\nout at first this morning to see you and Miss Clare looking so neat\\nand pretty and to feel ashamed of Peepy and myself too, but on the\\nwhole I hope I am better-tempered than I was and more forgiving to\\nMa.\"\\n\\nThe poor girl, trying so hard, said it from her heart, and touched\\nmine. \"Caddy, my love,\" I replied, \"I begin to have a great affection\\nfor you, and I hope we shall become friends.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, do you?\" cried Caddy. \"How happy that would make me!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Caddy,\" said I, \"let us be friends from this time, and let\\nus often have a chat about these matters and try to find the right\\nway through them.\" Caddy was overjoyed. I said everything I could in\\nmy old-fashioned way to comfort and encourage her, and I would not\\nhave objected to old Mr. Turveydrop that day for any smaller\\nconsideration than a settlement on his daughter-in-law.\\n\\nBy this time we were come to Mr. Krook\\'s, whose private door stood\\nopen. There was a bill, pasted on the door-post, announcing a room to\\nlet on the second floor. It reminded Caddy to tell me as we proceeded\\nupstairs that there had been a sudden death there and an inquest and\\nthat our little friend had been ill of the fright. The door and\\nwindow of the vacant room being open, we looked in. It was the room\\nwith the dark door to which Miss Flite had secretly directed my\\nattention when I was last in the house. A sad and desolate place it\\nwas, a gloomy, sorrowful place that gave me a strange sensation of\\nmournfulness and even dread. \"You look pale,\" said Caddy when we came\\nout, \"and cold!\" I felt as if the room had chilled me.\\n\\nWe had walked slowly while we were talking, and my guardian and Ada\\nwere here before us. We found them in Miss Flite\\'s garret. They were\\nlooking at the birds, while a medical gentleman who was so good as to\\nattend Miss Flite with much solicitude and compassion spoke with her\\ncheerfully by the fire.\\n\\n\"I have finished my professional visit,\" he said, coming forward.\\n\"Miss Flite is much better and may appear in court (as her mind is\\nset upon it) to-morrow. She has been greatly missed there, I\\nunderstand.\"\\n\\nMiss Flite received the compliment with complacency and dropped a\\ngeneral curtsy to us.\\n\\n\"Honoured, indeed,\" said she, \"by another visit from the wards in\\nJarndyce! Ve-ry happy to receive Jarndyce of Bleak House beneath my\\nhumble roof!\" with a special curtsy. \"Fitz-Jarndyce, my dear\"--she\\nhad bestowed that name on Caddy, it appeared, and always called her\\nby it--\"a double welcome!\"\\n\\n\"Has she been very ill?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce of the gentleman whom we\\nhad found in attendance on her. She answered for herself directly,\\nthough he had put the question in a whisper.\\n\\n\"Oh, decidedly unwell! Oh, very unwell indeed,\" she said\\nconfidentially. \"Not pain, you know--trouble. Not bodily so much as\\nnervous, nervous! The truth is,\" in a subdued voice and trembling,\\n\"we have had death here. There was poison in the house. I am very\\nsusceptible to such horrid things. It frightened me. Only Mr.\\nWoodcourt knows how much. My physician, Mr. Woodcourt!\" with\\ngreat stateliness. \"The wards in Jarndyce--Jarndyce of Bleak\\nHouse--Fitz-Jarndyce!\"\\n\\n\"Miss Flite,\" said Mr. Woodcourt in a grave kind of voice, as if he\\nwere appealing to her while speaking to us, and laying his hand\\ngently on her arm, \"Miss Flite describes her illness with her usual\\naccuracy. She was alarmed by an occurrence in the house which might\\nhave alarmed a stronger person, and was made ill by the distress and\\nagitation. She brought me here in the first hurry of the discovery,\\nthough too late for me to be of any use to the unfortunate man. I\\nhave compensated myself for that disappointment by coming here since\\nand being of some small use to her.\"\\n\\n\"The kindest physician in the college,\" whispered Miss Flite to me.\\n\"I expect a judgment. On the day of judgment. And shall then confer\\nestates.\"\\n\\n\"She will be as well in a day or two,\" said Mr. Woodcourt, looking at\\nher with an observant smile, \"as she ever will be. In other words,\\nquite well of course. Have you heard of her good fortune?\"\\n\\n\"Most extraordinary!\" said Miss Flite, smiling brightly. \"You never\\nheard of such a thing, my dear! Every Saturday, Conversation Kenge or\\nGuppy (clerk to Conversation K.) places in my hand a paper of\\nshillings. Shillings. I assure you! Always the same number in the\\npaper. Always one for every day in the week. Now you know, really! So\\nwell-timed, is it not? Ye-es! From whence do these papers come, you\\nsay? That is the great question. Naturally. Shall I tell you what I\\nthink? I think,\" said Miss Flite, drawing herself back with a very\\nshrewd look and shaking her right forefinger in a most significant\\nmanner, \"that the Lord Chancellor, aware of the length of time during\\nwhich the Great Seal has been open (for it has been open a long\\ntime!), forwards them. Until the judgment I expect is given. Now\\nthat\\'s very creditable, you know. To confess in that way that he IS a\\nlittle slow for human life. So delicate! Attending court the other\\nday--I attend it regularly, with my documents--I taxed him with it,\\nand he almost confessed. That is, I smiled at him from my bench, and\\nHE smiled at me from his bench. But it\\'s great good fortune, is it\\nnot? And Fitz-Jarndyce lays the money out for me to great advantage.\\nOh, I assure you to the greatest advantage!\"\\n\\nI congratulated her (as she addressed herself to me) upon this\\nfortunate addition to her income and wished her a long continuance of\\nit. I did not speculate upon the source from which it came or wonder\\nwhose humanity was so considerate. My guardian stood before me,\\ncontemplating the birds, and I had no need to look beyond him.\\n\\n\"And what do you call these little fellows, ma\\'am?\" said he in his\\npleasant voice. \"Have they any names?\"\\n\\n\"I can answer for Miss Flite that they have,\" said I, \"for she\\npromised to tell us what they were. Ada remembers?\"\\n\\nAda remembered very well.\\n\\n\"Did I?\" said Miss Flite. \"Who\\'s that at my door? What are you\\nlistening at my door for, Krook?\"\\n\\nThe old man of the house, pushing it open before him, appeared there\\nwith his fur cap in his hand and his cat at his heels.\\n\\n\"I warn\\'t listening, Miss Flite,\" he said, \"I was going to give a rap\\nwith my knuckles, only you\\'re so quick!\"\\n\\n\"Make your cat go down. Drive her away!\" the old lady angrily\\nexclaimed.\\n\\n\"Bah, bah! There ain\\'t no danger, gentlefolks,\" said Mr. Krook,\\nlooking slowly and sharply from one to another until he had looked at\\nall of us; \"she\\'d never offer at the birds when I was here unless I\\ntold her to it.\"\\n\\n\"You will excuse my landlord,\" said the old lady with a dignified\\nair. \"M, quite M! What do you want, Krook, when I have company?\"\\n\\n\"Hi!\" said the old man. \"You know I am the Chancellor.\"\\n\\n\"Well?\" returned Miss Flite. \"What of that?\"\\n\\n\"For the Chancellor,\" said the old man with a chuckle, \"not to be\\nacquainted with a Jarndyce is queer, ain\\'t it, Miss Flite? Mightn\\'t I\\ntake the liberty? Your servant, sir. I know Jarndyce and Jarndyce\\na\\'most as well as you do, sir. I knowed old Squire Tom, sir. I never\\nto my knowledge see you afore though, not even in court. Yet, I go\\nthere a mortal sight of times in the course of the year, taking one\\nday with another.\"\\n\\n\"I never go there,\" said Mr. Jarndyce (which he never did on any\\nconsideration). \"I would sooner go--somewhere else.\"\\n\\n\"Would you though?\" returned Krook, grinning. \"You\\'re bearing hard\\nupon my noble and learned brother in your meaning, sir, though\\nperhaps it is but nat\\'ral in a Jarndyce. The burnt child, sir! What,\\nyou\\'re looking at my lodger\\'s birds, Mr. Jarndyce?\" The old man had\\ncome by little and little into the room until he now touched my\\nguardian with his elbow and looked close up into his face with his\\nspectacled eyes. \"It\\'s one of her strange ways that she\\'ll never tell\\nthe names of these birds if she can help it, though she named \\'em\\nall.\" This was in a whisper. \"Shall I run \\'em over, Flite?\" he asked\\naloud, winking at us and pointing at her as she turned away,\\naffecting to sweep the grate.\\n\\n\"If you like,\" she answered hurriedly.\\n\\nThe old man, looking up at the cages after another look at us, went\\nthrough the list.\\n\\n\"Hope, Joy, Youth, Peace, Rest, Life, Dust, Ashes, Waste, Want, Ruin,\\nDespair, Madness, Death, Cunning, Folly, Words, Wigs, Rags,\\nSheepskin, Plunder, Precedent, Jargon, Gammon, and Spinach. That\\'s\\nthe whole collection,\" said the old man, \"all cooped up together, by\\nmy noble and learned brother.\"\\n\\n\"This is a bitter wind!\" muttered my guardian.\\n\\n\"When my noble and learned brother gives his judgment, they\\'re to be\\nlet go free,\" said Krook, winking at us again. \"And then,\" he added,\\nwhispering and grinning, \"if that ever was to happen--which it\\nwon\\'t--the birds that have never been caged would kill \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"If ever the wind was in the east,\" said my guardian, pretending to\\nlook out of the window for a weathercock, \"I think it\\'s there\\nto-day!\"\\n\\nWe found it very difficult to get away from the house. It was not\\nMiss Flite who detained us; she was as reasonable a little creature\\nin consulting the convenience of others as there possibly could be.\\nIt was Mr. Krook. He seemed unable to detach himself from Mr.\\nJarndyce. If he had been linked to him, he could hardly have attended\\nhim more closely. He proposed to show us his Court of Chancery and\\nall the strange medley it contained; during the whole of our\\ninspection (prolonged by himself) he kept close to Mr. Jarndyce and\\nsometimes detained him under one pretence or other until we had\\npassed on, as if he were tormented by an inclination to enter upon\\nsome secret subject which he could not make up his mind to approach.\\nI cannot imagine a countenance and manner more singularly expressive\\nof caution and indecision, and a perpetual impulse to do something he\\ncould not resolve to venture on, than Mr. Krook\\'s was that day. His\\nwatchfulness of my guardian was incessant. He rarely removed his eyes\\nfrom his face. If he went on beside him, he observed him with the\\nslyness of an old white fox. If he went before, he looked back. When\\nwe stood still, he got opposite to him, and drawing his hand across\\nand across his open mouth with a curious expression of a sense of\\npower, and turning up his eyes, and lowering his grey eyebrows until\\nthey appeared to be shut, seemed to scan every lineament of his face.\\n\\nAt last, having been (always attended by the cat) all over the house\\nand having seen the whole stock of miscellaneous lumber, which was\\ncertainly curious, we came into the back part of the shop. Here on\\nthe head of an empty barrel stood on end were an ink-bottle, some old\\nstumps of pens, and some dirty playbills; and against the wall were\\npasted several large printed alphabets in several plain hands.\\n\\n\"What are you doing here?\" asked my guardian.\\n\\n\"Trying to learn myself to read and write,\" said Krook.\\n\\n\"And how do you get on?\"\\n\\n\"Slow. Bad,\" returned the old man impatiently. \"It\\'s hard at my time\\nof life.\"\\n\\n\"It would be easier to be taught by some one,\" said my guardian.\\n\\n\"Aye, but they might teach me wrong!\" returned the old man with a\\nwonderfully suspicious flash of his eye. \"I don\\'t know what I may\\nhave lost by not being learned afore. I wouldn\\'t like to lose\\nanything by being learned wrong now.\"\\n\\n\"Wrong?\" said my guardian with his good-humoured smile. \"Who do you\\nsuppose would teach you wrong?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House!\" replied the old man,\\nturning up his spectacles on his forehead and rubbing his hands. \"I\\ndon\\'t suppose as anybody would, but I\\'d rather trust my own self than\\nanother!\"\\n\\nThese answers and his manner were strange enough to cause my guardian\\nto inquire of Mr. Woodcourt, as we all walked across Lincoln\\'s Inn\\ntogether, whether Mr. Krook were really, as his lodger represented\\nhim, deranged. The young surgeon replied, no, he had seen no reason\\nto think so. He was exceedingly distrustful, as ignorance usually\\nwas, and he was always more or less under the influence of raw gin,\\nof which he drank great quantities and of which he and his back-shop,\\nas we might have observed, smelt strongly; but he did not think him\\nmad as yet.\\n\\nOn our way home, I so conciliated Peepy\\'s affections by buying him a\\nwindmill and two flour-sacks that he would suffer nobody else to take\\noff his hat and gloves and would sit nowhere at dinner but at my\\nside. Caddy sat upon the other side of me, next to Ada, to whom we\\nimparted the whole history of the engagement as soon as we got back.\\nWe made much of Caddy, and Peepy too; and Caddy brightened\\nexceedingly; and my guardian was as merry as we were; and we were all\\nvery happy indeed until Caddy went home at night in a hackney-coach,\\nwith Peepy fast asleep, but holding tight to the windmill.\\n\\nI have forgotten to mention--at least I have not mentioned--that Mr.\\nWoodcourt was the same dark young surgeon whom we had met at Mr.\\nBadger\\'s. Or that Mr. Jarndyce invited him to dinner that day. Or\\nthat he came. Or that when they were all gone and I said to Ada,\\n\"Now, my darling, let us have a little talk about Richard!\" Ada\\nlaughed and said--\\n\\nBut I don\\'t think it matters what my darling said. She was always\\nmerry.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile we were in London Mr. Jarndyce was constantly beset by the\\ncrowd of excitable ladies and gentlemen whose proceedings had so much\\nastonished us. Mr. Quale, who presented himself soon after our\\narrival, was in all such excitements. He seemed to project those two\\nshining knobs of temples of his into everything that went on and to\\nbrush his hair farther and farther back, until the very roots were\\nalmost ready to fly out of his head in inappeasable philanthropy. All\\nobjects were alike to him, but he was always particularly ready for\\nanything in the way of a testimonial to any one. His great power\\nseemed to be his power of indiscriminate admiration. He would sit for\\nany length of time, with the utmost enjoyment, bathing his temples in\\nthe light of any order of luminary. Having first seen him perfectly\\nswallowed up in admiration of Mrs. Jellyby, I had supposed her to be\\nthe absorbing object of his devotion. I soon discovered my mistake\\nand found him to be train-bearer and organ-blower to a whole\\nprocession of people.\\n\\nMrs. Pardiggle came one day for a subscription to something, and with\\nher, Mr. Quale. Whatever Mrs. Pardiggle said, Mr. Quale repeated to\\nus; and just as he had drawn Mrs. Jellyby out, he drew Mrs. Pardiggle\\nout. Mrs. Pardiggle wrote a letter of introduction to my guardian in\\nbehalf of her eloquent friend Mr. Gusher. With Mr. Gusher appeared\\nMr. Quale again. Mr. Gusher, being a flabby gentleman with a moist\\nsurface and eyes so much too small for his moon of a face that they\\nseemed to have been originally made for somebody else, was not at\\nfirst sight prepossessing; yet he was scarcely seated before Mr.\\nQuale asked Ada and me, not inaudibly, whether he was not a great\\ncreature--which he certainly was, flabbily speaking, though Mr. Quale\\nmeant in intellectual beauty--and whether we were not struck by his\\nmassive configuration of brow. In short, we heard of a great many\\nmissions of various sorts among this set of people, but nothing\\nrespecting them was half so clear to us as that it was Mr. Quale\\'s\\nmission to be in ecstasies with everybody else\\'s mission and that it\\nwas the most popular mission of all.\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce had fallen into this company in the tenderness of his\\nheart and his earnest desire to do all the good in his power; but\\nthat he felt it to be too often an unsatisfactory company, where\\nbenevolence took spasmodic forms, where charity was assumed as a\\nregular uniform by loud professors and speculators in cheap\\nnotoriety, vehement in profession, restless and vain in action,\\nservile in the last degree of meanness to the great, adulatory of one\\nanother, and intolerable to those who were anxious quietly to help\\nthe weak from failing rather than with a great deal of bluster and\\nself-laudation to raise them up a little way when they were down, he\\nplainly told us. When a testimonial was originated to Mr. Quale by\\nMr. Gusher (who had already got one, originated by Mr. Quale), and\\nwhen Mr. Gusher spoke for an hour and a half on the subject to a\\nmeeting, including two charity schools of small boys and girls, who\\nwere specially reminded of the widow\\'s mite, and requested to come\\nforward with halfpence and be acceptable sacrifices, I think the wind\\nwas in the east for three whole weeks.\\n\\nI mention this because I am coming to Mr. Skimpole again. It seemed\\nto me that his off-hand professions of childishness and carelessness\\nwere a great relief to my guardian, by contrast with such things, and\\nwere the more readily believed in since to find one perfectly\\nundesigning and candid man among many opposites could not fail to\\ngive him pleasure. I should be sorry to imply that Mr. Skimpole\\ndivined this and was politic; I really never understood him well\\nenough to know. What he was to my guardian, he certainly was to the\\nrest of the world.\\n\\nHe had not been very well; and thus, though he lived in London, we\\nhad seen nothing of him until now. He appeared one morning in his\\nusual agreeable way and as full of pleasant spirits as ever.\\n\\nWell, he said, here he was! He had been bilious, but rich men were\\noften bilious, and therefore he had been persuading himself that he\\nwas a man of property. So he was, in a certain point of view--in his\\nexpansive intentions. He had been enriching his medical attendant in\\nthe most lavish manner. He had always doubled, and sometimes\\nquadrupled, his fees. He had said to the doctor, \"Now, my dear\\ndoctor, it is quite a delusion on your part to suppose that you\\nattend me for nothing. I am overwhelming you with money--in my\\nexpansive intentions--if you only knew it!\" And really (he said) he\\nmeant it to that degree that he thought it much the same as doing it.\\nIf he had had those bits of metal or thin paper to which mankind\\nattached so much importance to put in the doctor\\'s hand, he would\\nhave put them in the doctor\\'s hand. Not having them, he substituted\\nthe will for the deed. Very well! If he really meant it--if his will\\nwere genuine and real, which it was--it appeared to him that it was\\nthe same as coin, and cancelled the obligation.\\n\\n\"It may be, partly, because I know nothing of the value of money,\"\\nsaid Mr. Skimpole, \"but I often feel this. It seems so reasonable! My\\nbutcher says to me he wants that little bill. It\\'s a part of the\\npleasant unconscious poetry of the man\\'s nature that he always calls\\nit a \\'little\\' bill--to make the payment appear easy to both of us. I\\nreply to the butcher, \\'My good friend, if you knew it, you are paid.\\nYou haven\\'t had the trouble of coming to ask for the little bill. You\\nare paid. I mean it.\\'\"\\n\\n\"But, suppose,\" said my guardian, laughing, \"he had meant the meat in\\nthe bill, instead of providing it?\"\\n\\n\"My dear Jarndyce,\" he returned, \"you surprise me. You take the\\nbutcher\\'s position. A butcher I once dealt with occupied that very\\nground. Says he, \\'Sir, why did you eat spring lamb at eighteen pence\\na pound?\\' \\'Why did I eat spring lamb at eighteen pence a pound, my\\nhonest friend?\\' said I, naturally amazed by the question. \\'I like\\nspring lamb!\\' This was so far convincing. \\'Well, sir,\\' says he, \\'I\\nwish I had meant the lamb as you mean the money!\\' \\'My good fellow,\\'\\nsaid I, \\'pray let us reason like intellectual beings. How could that\\nbe? It was impossible. You HAD got the lamb, and I have NOT got the\\nmoney. You couldn\\'t really mean the lamb without sending it in,\\nwhereas I can, and do, really mean the money without paying it!\\' He\\nhad not a word. There was an end of the subject.\"\\n\\n\"Did he take no legal proceedings?\" inquired my guardian.\\n\\n\"Yes, he took legal proceedings,\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"But in that he\\nwas influenced by passion, not by reason. Passion reminds me of\\nBoythorn. He writes me that you and the ladies have promised him a\\nshort visit at his bachelor-house in Lincolnshire.\"\\n\\n\"He is a great favourite with my girls,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"and I\\nhave promised for them.\"\\n\\n\"Nature forgot to shade him off, I think,\" observed Mr. Skimpole to\\nAda and me. \"A little too boisterous--like the sea. A little too\\nvehement--like a bull who has made up his mind to consider every\\ncolour scarlet. But I grant a sledge-hammering sort of merit in him!\"\\n\\nI should have been surprised if those two could have thought very\\nhighly of one another, Mr. Boythorn attaching so much importance to\\nmany things and Mr. Skimpole caring so little for anything. Besides\\nwhich, I had noticed Mr. Boythorn more than once on the point of\\nbreaking out into some strong opinion when Mr. Skimpole was referred\\nto. Of course I merely joined Ada in saying that we had been greatly\\npleased with him.\\n\\n\"He has invited me,\" said Mr. Skimpole; \"and if a child may trust\\nhimself in such hands--which the present child is encouraged to do,\\nwith the united tenderness of two angels to guard him--I shall go. He\\nproposes to frank me down and back again. I suppose it will cost\\nmoney? Shillings perhaps? Or pounds? Or something of that sort? By\\nthe by, Coavinses. You remember our friend Coavinses, Miss\\nSummerson?\"\\n\\nHe asked me as the subject arose in his mind, in his graceful,\\nlight-hearted manner and without the least embarrassment.\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" said I.\\n\\n\"Coavinses has been arrested by the Great Bailiff,\" said Mr.\\nSkimpole. \"He will never do violence to the sunshine any more.\"\\n\\nIt quite shocked me to hear it, for I had already recalled with\\nanything but a serious association the image of the man sitting on\\nthe sofa that night wiping his head.\\n\\n\"His successor informed me of it yesterday,\" said Mr. Skimpole. \"His\\nsuccessor is in my house now--in possession, I think he calls it. He\\ncame yesterday, on my blue-eyed daughter\\'s birthday. I put it to him,\\n\\'This is unreasonable and inconvenient. If you had a blue-eyed\\ndaughter you wouldn\\'t like ME to come, uninvited, on HER birthday?\\'\\nBut he stayed.\"\\n\\nMr. Skimpole laughed at the pleasant absurdity and lightly touched\\nthe piano by which he was seated.\\n\\n\"And he told me,\" he said, playing little chords where I shall put\\nfull stops, \"The Coavinses had left. Three children. No mother. And\\nthat Coavinses\\' profession. Being unpopular. The rising Coavinses.\\nWere at a considerable disadvantage.\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce got up, rubbing his head, and began to walk about. Mr.\\nSkimpole played the melody of one of Ada\\'s favourite songs. Ada and I\\nboth looked at Mr. Jarndyce, thinking that we knew what was passing\\nin his mind.\\n\\nAfter walking and stopping, and several times leaving off rubbing his\\nhead, and beginning again, my guardian put his hand upon the keys and\\nstopped Mr. Skimpole\\'s playing. \"I don\\'t like this, Skimpole,\" he\\nsaid thoughtfully.\\n\\nMr. Skimpole, who had quite forgotten the subject, looked up\\nsurprised.\\n\\n\"The man was necessary,\" pursued my guardian, walking backward and\\nforward in the very short space between the piano and the end of the\\nroom and rubbing his hair up from the back of his head as if a high\\neast wind had blown it into that form. \"If we make such men necessary\\nby our faults and follies, or by our want of worldly knowledge, or by\\nour misfortunes, we must not revenge ourselves upon them. There was\\nno harm in his trade. He maintained his children. One would like to\\nknow more about this.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Coavinses?\" cried Mr. Skimpole, at length perceiving what he\\nmeant. \"Nothing easier. A walk to Coavinses\\' headquarters, and you\\ncan know what you will.\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce nodded to us, who were only waiting for the signal.\\n\"Come! We will walk that way, my dears. Why not that way as soon as\\nanother!\" We were quickly ready and went out. Mr. Skimpole went with\\nus and quite enjoyed the expedition. It was so new and so refreshing,\\nhe said, for him to want Coavinses instead of Coavinses wanting him!\\n\\nHe took us, first, to Cursitor Street, Chancery Lane, where there was\\na house with barred windows, which he called Coavinses\\' Castle. On\\nour going into the entry and ringing a bell, a very hideous boy came\\nout of a sort of office and looked at us over a spiked wicket.\\n\\n\"Who did you want?\" said the boy, fitting two of the spikes into his\\nchin.\\n\\n\"There was a follower, or an officer, or something, here,\" said Mr.\\nJarndyce, \"who is dead.\"\\n\\n\"Yes?\" said the boy. \"Well?\"\\n\\n\"I want to know his name, if you please?\"\\n\\n\"Name of Neckett,\" said the boy.\\n\\n\"And his address?\"\\n\\n\"Bell Yard,\" said the boy. \"Chandler\\'s shop, left hand side, name of\\nBlinder.\"\\n\\n\"Was he--I don\\'t know how to shape the question--\" murmured my\\nguardian, \"industrious?\"\\n\\n\"Was Neckett?\" said the boy. \"Yes, wery much so. He was never tired\\nof watching. He\\'d set upon a post at a street corner eight or ten\\nhours at a stretch if he undertook to do it.\"\\n\\n\"He might have done worse,\" I heard my guardian soliloquize. \"He\\nmight have undertaken to do it and not done it. Thank you. That\\'s all\\nI want.\"\\n\\nWe left the boy, with his head on one side and his arms on the gate,\\nfondling and sucking the spikes, and went back to Lincoln\\'s Inn,\\nwhere Mr. Skimpole, who had not cared to remain nearer Coavinses,\\nawaited us. Then we all went to Bell Yard, a narrow alley at a very\\nshort distance. We soon found the chandler\\'s shop. In it was a\\ngood-natured-looking old woman with a dropsy, or an asthma, or\\nperhaps both.\\n\\n\"Neckett\\'s children?\" said she in reply to my inquiry. \"Yes, Surely,\\nmiss. Three pair, if you please. Door right opposite the stairs.\" And\\nshe handed me the key across the counter.\\n\\nI glanced at the key and glanced at her, but she took it for granted\\nthat I knew what to do with it. As it could only be intended for the\\nchildren\\'s door, I came out without asking any more questions and led\\nthe way up the dark stairs. We went as quietly as we could, but four\\nof us made some noise on the aged boards, and when we came to the\\nsecond story we found we had disturbed a man who was standing there\\nlooking out of his room.\\n\\n\"Is it Gridley that\\'s wanted?\" he said, fixing his eyes on me with an\\nangry stare.\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" said I; \"I am going higher up.\"\\n\\nHe looked at Ada, and at Mr. Jarndyce, and at Mr. Skimpole, fixing\\nthe same angry stare on each in succession as they passed and\\nfollowed me. Mr. Jarndyce gave him good day. \"Good day!\" he said\\nabruptly and fiercely. He was a tall, sallow man with a careworn head\\non which but little hair remained, a deeply lined face, and prominent\\neyes. He had a combative look and a chafing, irritable manner which,\\nassociated with his figure--still large and powerful, though\\nevidently in its decline--rather alarmed me. He had a pen in his\\nhand, and in the glimpse I caught of his room in passing, I saw that\\nit was covered with a litter of papers.\\n\\nLeaving him standing there, we went up to the top room. I tapped at\\nthe door, and a little shrill voice inside said, \"We are locked in.\\nMrs. Blinder\\'s got the key!\"\\n\\nI applied the key on hearing this and opened the door. In a poor room\\nwith a sloping ceiling and containing very little furniture was a\\nmite of a boy, some five or six years old, nursing and hushing a\\nheavy child of eighteen months. There was no fire, though the weather\\nwas cold; both children were wrapped in some poor shawls and tippets\\nas a substitute. Their clothing was not so warm, however, but that\\ntheir noses looked red and pinched and their small figures shrunken\\nas the boy walked up and down nursing and hushing the child with its\\nhead on his shoulder.\\n\\n\"Who has locked you up here alone?\" we naturally asked.\\n\\n\"Charley,\" said the boy, standing still to gaze at us.\\n\\n\"Is Charley your brother?\"\\n\\n\"No. She\\'s my sister, Charlotte. Father called her Charley.\"\\n\\n\"Are there any more of you besides Charley?\"\\n\\n\"Me,\" said the boy, \"and Emma,\" patting the limp bonnet of the child\\nhe was nursing. \"And Charley.\"\\n\\n\"Where is Charley now?\"\\n\\n\"Out a-washing,\" said the boy, beginning to walk up and down again\\nand taking the nankeen bonnet much too near the bedstead by trying to\\ngaze at us at the same time.\\n\\nWe were looking at one another and at these two children when there\\ncame into the room a very little girl, childish in figure but shrewd\\nand older-looking in the face--pretty-faced too--wearing a womanly\\nsort of bonnet much too large for her and drying her bare arms on a\\nwomanly sort of apron. Her fingers were white and wrinkled with\\nwashing, and the soap-suds were yet smoking which she wiped off her\\narms. But for this, she might have been a child playing at washing\\nand imitating a poor working-woman with a quick observation of the\\ntruth.\\n\\nShe had come running from some place in the neighbourhood and had\\nmade all the haste she could. Consequently, though she was very\\nlight, she was out of breath and could not speak at first, as she\\nstood panting, and wiping her arms, and looking quietly at us.\\n\\n\"Oh, here\\'s Charley!\" said the boy.\\n\\nThe child he was nursing stretched forth its arms and cried out to be\\ntaken by Charley. The little girl took it, in a womanly sort of\\nmanner belonging to the apron and the bonnet, and stood looking at us\\nover the burden that clung to her most affectionately.\\n\\n\"Is it possible,\" whispered my guardian as we put a chair for the\\nlittle creature and got her to sit down with her load, the boy\\nkeeping close to her, holding to her apron, \"that this child works\\nfor the rest? Look at this! For God\\'s sake, look at this!\"\\n\\nIt was a thing to look at. The three children close together, and two\\nof them relying solely on the third, and the third so young and yet\\nwith an air of age and steadiness that sat so strangely on the\\nchildish figure.\\n\\n\"Charley, Charley!\" said my guardian. \"How old are you?\"\\n\\n\"Over thirteen, sir,\" replied the child.\\n\\n\"Oh! What a great age,\" said my guardian. \"What a great age,\\nCharley!\"\\n\\nI cannot describe the tenderness with which he spoke to her, half\\nplayfully yet all the more compassionately and mournfully.\\n\\n\"And do you live alone here with these babies, Charley?\" said my\\nguardian.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" returned the child, looking up into his face with perfect\\nconfidence, \"since father died.\"\\n\\n\"And how do you live, Charley? Oh! Charley,\" said my guardian,\\nturning his face away for a moment, \"how do you live?\"\\n\\n\"Since father died, sir, I\\'ve gone out to work. I\\'m out washing\\nto-day.\"\\n\\n\"God help you, Charley!\" said my guardian. \"You\\'re not tall enough to\\nreach the tub!\"\\n\\n\"In pattens I am, sir,\" she said quickly. \"I\\'ve got a high pair as\\nbelonged to mother.\"\\n\\n\"And when did mother die? Poor mother!\"\\n\\n\"Mother died just after Emma was born,\" said the child, glancing at\\nthe face upon her bosom. \"Then father said I was to be as good a\\nmother to her as I could. And so I tried. And so I worked at home and\\ndid cleaning and nursing and washing for a long time before I began\\nto go out. And that\\'s how I know how; don\\'t you see, sir?\"\\n\\n\"And do you often go out?\"\\n\\n\"As often as I can,\" said Charley, opening her eyes and smiling,\\n\"because of earning sixpences and shillings!\"\\n\\n\"And do you always lock the babies up when you go out?\"\\n\\n\"To keep \\'em safe, sir, don\\'t you see?\" said Charley. \"Mrs. Blinder\\ncomes up now and then, and Mr. Gridley comes up sometimes, and\\nperhaps I can run in sometimes, and they can play you know, and Tom\\nan\\'t afraid of being locked up, are you, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"No-o!\" said Tom stoutly.\\n\\n\"When it comes on dark, the lamps are lighted down in the court, and\\nthey show up here quite bright--almost quite bright. Don\\'t they,\\nTom?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, Charley,\" said Tom, \"almost quite bright.\"\\n\\n\"Then he\\'s as good as gold,\" said the little creature--Oh, in such a\\nmotherly, womanly way! \"And when Emma\\'s tired, he puts her to bed.\\nAnd when he\\'s tired he goes to bed himself. And when I come home and\\nlight the candle and has a bit of supper, he sits up again and has it\\nwith me. Don\\'t you, Tom?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, Charley!\" said Tom. \"That I do!\" And either in this glimpse\\nof the great pleasure of his life or in gratitude and love for\\nCharley, who was all in all to him, he laid his face among the scanty\\nfolds of her frock and passed from laughing into crying.\\n\\nIt was the first time since our entry that a tear had been shed among\\nthese children. The little orphan girl had spoken of their father and\\ntheir mother as if all that sorrow were subdued by the necessity of\\ntaking courage, and by her childish importance in being able to work,\\nand by her bustling busy way. But now, when Tom cried, although she\\nsat quite tranquil, looking quietly at us, and did not by any\\nmovement disturb a hair of the head of either of her little charges,\\nI saw two silent tears fall down her face.\\n\\nI stood at the window with Ada, pretending to look at the housetops,\\nand the blackened stack of chimneys, and the poor plants, and the\\nbirds in little cages belonging to the neighbours, when I found that\\nMrs. Blinder, from the shop below, had come in (perhaps it had taken\\nher all this time to get upstairs) and was talking to my guardian.\\n\\n\"It\\'s not much to forgive \\'em the rent, sir,\" she said; \"who could\\ntake it from them!\"\\n\\n\"Well, well!\" said my guardian to us two. \"It is enough that the time\\nwill come when this good woman will find that it WAS much, and that\\nforasmuch as she did it unto the least of these--This child,\" he\\nadded after a few moments, \"could she possibly continue this?\"\\n\\n\"Really, sir, I think she might,\" said Mrs. Blinder, getting her\\nheavy breath by painful degrees. \"She\\'s as handy as it\\'s possible to\\nbe. Bless you, sir, the way she tended them two children after the\\nmother died was the talk of the yard! And it was a wonder to see her\\nwith him after he was took ill, it really was! \\'Mrs. Blinder,\\' he\\nsaid to me the very last he spoke--he was lying there--\\'Mrs.\\nBlinder, whatever my calling may have been, I see a angel sitting in\\nthis room last night along with my child, and I trust her to Our\\nFather!\\'\"\\n\\n\"He had no other calling?\" said my guardian.\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" returned Mrs. Blinder, \"he was nothing but a follerers.\\nWhen he first came to lodge here, I didn\\'t know what he was, and I\\nconfess that when I found out I gave him notice. It wasn\\'t liked in\\nthe yard. It wasn\\'t approved by the other lodgers. It is NOT a\\ngenteel calling,\" said Mrs. Blinder, \"and most people do object to\\nit. Mr. Gridley objected to it very strong, and he is a good lodger,\\nthough his temper has been hard tried.\"\\n\\n\"So you gave him notice?\" said my guardian.\\n\\n\"So I gave him notice,\" said Mrs. Blinder. \"But really when the time\\ncame, and I knew no other ill of him, I was in doubts. He was\\npunctual and diligent; he did what he had to do, sir,\" said Mrs.\\nBlinder, unconsciously fixing Mr. Skimpole with her eye, \"and it\\'s\\nsomething in this world even to do that.\"\\n\\n\"So you kept him after all?\"\\n\\n\"Why, I said that if he could arrange with Mr. Gridley, I could\\narrange it with the other lodgers and should not so much mind its\\nbeing liked or disliked in the yard. Mr. Gridley gave his consent\\ngruff--but gave it. He was always gruff with him, but he has been\\nkind to the children since. A person is never known till a person is\\nproved.\"\\n\\n\"Have many people been kind to the children?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Upon the whole, not so bad, sir,\" said Mrs. Blinder; \"but certainly\\nnot so many as would have been if their father\\'s calling had been\\ndifferent. Mr. Coavins gave a guinea, and the follerers made up a\\nlittle purse. Some neighbours in the yard that had always joked and\\ntapped their shoulders when he went by came forward with a little\\nsubscription, and--in general--not so bad. Similarly with Charlotte.\\nSome people won\\'t employ her because she was a follerer\\'s child; some\\npeople that do employ her cast it at her; some make a merit of having\\nher to work for them, with that and all her draw-backs upon her, and\\nperhaps pay her less and put upon her more. But she\\'s patienter than\\nothers would be, and is clever too, and always willing, up to the\\nfull mark of her strength and over. So I should say, in general, not\\nso bad, sir, but might be better.\"\\n\\nMrs. Blinder sat down to give herself a more favourable opportunity\\nof recovering her breath, exhausted anew by so much talking before it\\nwas fully restored. Mr. Jarndyce was turning to speak to us when his\\nattention was attracted by the abrupt entrance into the room of the\\nMr. Gridley who had been mentioned and whom we had seen on our way\\nup.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what you may be doing here, ladies and gentlemen,\" he\\nsaid, as if he resented our presence, \"but you\\'ll excuse my coming\\nin. I don\\'t come in to stare about me. Well, Charley! Well, Tom!\\nWell, little one! How is it with us all to-day?\"\\n\\nHe bent over the group in a caressing way and clearly was regarded as\\na friend by the children, though his face retained its stern\\ncharacter and his manner to us was as rude as it could be. My\\nguardian noticed it and respected it.\\n\\n\"No one, surely, would come here to stare about him,\" he said mildly.\\n\\n\"May be so, sir, may be so,\" returned the other, taking Tom upon his\\nknee and waving him off impatiently. \"I don\\'t want to argue with\\nladies and gentlemen. I have had enough of arguing to last one man\\nhis life.\"\\n\\n\"You have sufficient reason, I dare say,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"for\\nbeing chafed and irritated--\"\\n\\n\"There again!\" exclaimed the man, becoming violently angry. \"I am of\\na quarrelsome temper. I am irascible. I am not polite!\"\\n\\n\"Not very, I think.\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" said Gridley, putting down the child and going up to him as if\\nhe meant to strike him, \"do you know anything of Courts of Equity?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps I do, to my sorrow.\"\\n\\n\"To your sorrow?\" said the man, pausing in his wrath, \"if so, I beg\\nyour pardon. I am not polite, I know. I beg your pardon! Sir,\" with\\nrenewed violence, \"I have been dragged for five and twenty years over\\nburning iron, and I have lost the habit of treading upon velvet. Go\\ninto the Court of Chancery yonder and ask what is one of the standing\\njokes that brighten up their business sometimes, and they will tell\\nyou that the best joke they have is the man from Shropshire. I,\" he\\nsaid, beating one hand on the other passionately, \"am the man from\\nShropshire.\"\\n\\n\"I believe I and my family have also had the honour of furnishing\\nsome entertainment in the same grave place,\" said my guardian\\ncomposedly. \"You may have heard my name--Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" said Gridley with a rough sort of salutation, \"you\\nbear your wrongs more quietly than I can bear mine. More than that, I\\ntell you--and I tell this gentleman, and these young ladies, if they\\nare friends of yours--that if I took my wrongs in any other way, I\\nshould be driven mad! It is only by resenting them, and by revenging\\nthem in my mind, and by angrily demanding the justice I never get,\\nthat I am able to keep my wits together. It is only that!\" he said,\\nspeaking in a homely, rustic way and with great vehemence. \"You may\\ntell me that I over-excite myself. I answer that it\\'s in my nature to\\ndo it, under wrong, and I must do it. There\\'s nothing between doing\\nit, and sinking into the smiling state of the poor little mad woman\\nthat haunts the court. If I was once to sit down under it, I should\\nbecome imbecile.\"\\n\\nThe passion and heat in which he was, and the manner in which his\\nface worked, and the violent gestures with which he accompanied what\\nhe said, were most painful to see.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he said, \"consider my case. As true as there is a\\nheaven above us, this is my case. I am one of two brothers. My father\\n(a farmer) made a will and left his farm and stock and so forth to my\\nmother for her life. After my mother\\'s death, all was to come to me\\nexcept a legacy of three hundred pounds that I was then to pay my\\nbrother. My mother died. My brother some time afterwards claimed his\\nlegacy. I and some of my relations said that he had had a part of it\\nalready in board and lodging and some other things. Now mind! That\\nwas the question, and nothing else. No one disputed the will; no one\\ndisputed anything but whether part of that three hundred pounds had\\nbeen already paid or not. To settle that question, my brother filing\\na bill, I was obliged to go into this accursed Chancery; I was forced\\nthere because the law forced me and would let me go nowhere else.\\nSeventeen people were made defendants to that simple suit! It first\\ncame on after two years. It was then stopped for another two years\\nwhile the master (may his head rot off!) inquired whether I was my\\nfather\\'s son, about which there was no dispute at all with any mortal\\ncreature. He then found out that there were not defendants\\nenough--remember, there were only seventeen as yet!--but that we must\\nhave another who had been left out and must begin all over again. The\\ncosts at that time--before the thing was begun!--were three times the\\nlegacy. My brother would have given up the legacy, and joyful, to\\nescape more costs. My whole estate, left to me in that will of my\\nfather\\'s, has gone in costs. The suit, still undecided, has fallen\\ninto rack, and ruin, and despair, with everything else--and here I\\nstand, this day! Now, Mr. Jarndyce, in your suit there are thousands\\nand thousands involved, where in mine there are hundreds. Is mine\\nless hard to bear or is it harder to bear, when my whole living was\\nin it and has been thus shamefully sucked away?\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce said that he condoled with him with all his heart and\\nthat he set up no monopoly himself in being unjustly treated by this\\nmonstrous system.\\n\\n\"There again!\" said Mr. Gridley with no diminution of his rage. \"The\\nsystem! I am told on all hands, it\\'s the system. I mustn\\'t look to\\nindividuals. It\\'s the system. I mustn\\'t go into court and say, \\'My\\nLord, I beg to know this from you--is this right or wrong? Have you\\nthe face to tell me I have received justice and therefore am\\ndismissed?\\' My Lord knows nothing of it. He sits there to administer\\nthe system. I mustn\\'t go to Mr. Tulkinghorn, the solicitor in\\nLincoln\\'s Inn Fields, and say to him when he makes me furious by\\nbeing so cool and satisfied--as they all do, for I know they gain by\\nit while I lose, don\\'t I?--I mustn\\'t say to him, \\'I will have\\nsomething out of some one for my ruin, by fair means or foul!\\' HE is\\nnot responsible. It\\'s the system. But, if I do no violence to any of\\nthem, here--I may! I don\\'t know what may happen if I am carried\\nbeyond myself at last! I will accuse the individual workers of that\\nsystem against me, face to face, before the great eternal bar!\"\\n\\nHis passion was fearful. I could not have believed in such rage\\nwithout seeing it.\\n\\n\"I have done!\" he said, sitting down and wiping his face. \"Mr.\\nJarndyce, I have done! I am violent, I know. I ought to know it. I\\nhave been in prison for contempt of court. I have been in prison for\\nthreatening the solicitor. I have been in this trouble, and that\\ntrouble, and shall be again. I am the man from Shropshire, and I\\nsometimes go beyond amusing them, though they have found it amusing,\\ntoo, to see me committed into custody and brought up in custody and\\nall that. It would be better for me, they tell me, if I restrained\\nmyself. I tell them that if I did restrain myself I should become\\nimbecile. I was a good-enough-tempered man once, I believe. People in\\nmy part of the country say they remember me so, but now I must have\\nthis vent under my sense of injury or nothing could hold my wits\\ntogether. It would be far better for you, Mr. Gridley,\\' the Lord\\nChancellor told me last week, \\'not to waste your time here, and to\\nstay, usefully employed, down in Shropshire.\\' \\'My Lord, my Lord, I\\nknow it would,\\' said I to him, \\'and it would have been far better for\\nme never to have heard the name of your high office, but unhappily\\nfor me, I can\\'t undo the past, and the past drives me here!\\'\\nBesides,\" he added, breaking fiercely out, \"I\\'ll shame them. To the\\nlast, I\\'ll show myself in that court to its shame. If I knew when I\\nwas going to die, and could be carried there, and had a voice to\\nspeak with, I would die there, saying, \\'You have brought me here and\\nsent me from here many and many a time. Now send me out feet\\nforemost!\\'\"\\n\\nHis countenance had, perhaps for years, become so set in its\\ncontentious expression that it did not soften, even now when he was\\nquiet.\\n\\n\"I came to take these babies down to my room for an hour,\" he said,\\ngoing to them again, \"and let them play about. I didn\\'t mean to say\\nall this, but it don\\'t much signify. You\\'re not afraid of me, Tom,\\nare you?\"\\n\\n\"No!\" said Tom. \"You ain\\'t angry with ME.\"\\n\\n\"You are right, my child. You\\'re going back, Charley? Aye? Come then,\\nlittle one!\" He took the youngest child on his arm, where she was\\nwilling enough to be carried. \"I shouldn\\'t wonder if we found a\\nginger-bread soldier downstairs. Let\\'s go and look for him!\"\\n\\nHe made his former rough salutation, which was not deficient in a\\ncertain respect, to Mr. Jarndyce, and bowing slightly to us, went\\ndownstairs to his room.\\n\\nUpon that, Mr. Skimpole began to talk, for the first time since our\\narrival, in his usual gay strain. He said, Well, it was really very\\npleasant to see how things lazily adapted themselves to purposes.\\nHere was this Mr. Gridley, a man of a robust will and surprising\\nenergy--intellectually speaking, a sort of inharmonious\\nblacksmith--and he could easily imagine that there Gridley was, years\\nago, wandering about in life for something to expend his superfluous\\ncombativeness upon--a sort of Young Love among the thorns--when the\\nCourt of Chancery came in his way and accommodated him with the exact\\nthing he wanted. There they were, matched, ever afterwards! Otherwise\\nhe might have been a great general, blowing up all sorts of towns, or\\nhe might have been a great politician, dealing in all sorts of\\nparliamentary rhetoric; but as it was, he and the Court of Chancery\\nhad fallen upon each other in the pleasantest way, and nobody was\\nmuch the worse, and Gridley was, so to speak, from that hour provided\\nfor. Then look at Coavinses! How delightfully poor Coavinses (father\\nof these charming children) illustrated the same principle! He, Mr.\\nSkimpole, himself, had sometimes repined at the existence of\\nCoavinses. He had found Coavinses in his way. He could had dispensed\\nwith Coavinses. There had been times when, if he had been a sultan,\\nand his grand vizier had said one morning, \"What does the Commander\\nof the Faithful require at the hands of his slave?\" he might have\\neven gone so far as to reply, \"The head of Coavinses!\" But what\\nturned out to be the case? That, all that time, he had been giving\\nemployment to a most deserving man, that he had been a benefactor to\\nCoavinses, that he had actually been enabling Coavinses to bring up\\nthese charming children in this agreeable way, developing these\\nsocial virtues! Insomuch that his heart had just now swelled and the\\ntears had come into his eyes when he had looked round the room and\\nthought, \"I was the great patron of Coavinses, and his little\\ncomforts were MY work!\"\\n\\nThere was something so captivating in his light way of touching these\\nfantastic strings, and he was such a mirthful child by the side of\\nthe graver childhood we had seen, that he made my guardian smile even\\nas he turned towards us from a little private talk with Mrs. Blinder.\\nWe kissed Charley, and took her downstairs with us, and stopped\\noutside the house to see her run away to her work. I don\\'t know where\\nshe was going, but we saw her run, such a little, little creature in\\nher womanly bonnet and apron, through a covered way at the bottom of\\nthe court and melt into the city\\'s strife and sound like a dewdrop in\\nan ocean.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy Lady Dedlock is restless, very restless. The astonished\\nfashionable intelligence hardly knows where to have her. To-day she\\nis at Chesney Wold; yesterday she was at her house in town; to-morrow\\nshe may be abroad, for anything the fashionable intelligence can with\\nconfidence predict. Even Sir Leicester\\'s gallantry has some trouble\\nto keep pace with her. It would have more but that his other faithful\\nally, for better and for worse--the gout--darts into the old oak\\nbed-chamber at Chesney Wold and grips him by both legs.\\n\\nSir Leicester receives the gout as a troublesome demon, but still a\\ndemon of the patrician order. All the Dedlocks, in the direct male\\nline, through a course of time during and beyond which the memory of\\nman goeth not to the contrary, have had the gout. It can be proved,\\nsir. Other men\\'s fathers may have died of the rheumatism or may have\\ntaken base contagion from the tainted blood of the sick vulgar, but\\nthe Dedlock family have communicated something exclusive even to the\\nlevelling process of dying by dying of their own family gout. It has\\ncome down through the illustrious line like the plate, or the\\npictures, or the place in Lincolnshire. It is among their dignities.\\nSir Leicester is perhaps not wholly without an impression, though he\\nhas never resolved it into words, that the angel of death in the\\ndischarge of his necessary duties may observe to the shades of the\\naristocracy, \"My lords and gentlemen, I have the honour to present to\\nyou another Dedlock certified to have arrived per the family gout.\"\\n\\nHence Sir Leicester yields up his family legs to the family disorder\\nas if he held his name and fortune on that feudal tenure. He feels\\nthat for a Dedlock to be laid upon his back and spasmodically\\ntwitched and stabbed in his extremities is a liberty taken somewhere,\\nbut he thinks, \"We have all yielded to this; it belongs to us; it has\\nfor some hundreds of years been understood that we are not to make\\nthe vaults in the park interesting on more ignoble terms; and I\\nsubmit myself to the compromise.\"\\n\\nAnd a goodly show he makes, lying in a flush of crimson and gold in\\nthe midst of the great drawing-room before his favourite picture of\\nmy Lady, with broad strips of sunlight shining in, down the long\\nperspective, through the long line of windows, and alternating with\\nsoft reliefs of shadow. Outside, the stately oaks, rooted for ages in\\nthe green ground which has never known ploughshare, but was still a\\nchase when kings rode to battle with sword and shield and rode\\na-hunting with bow and arrow, bear witness to his greatness. Inside,\\nhis forefathers, looking on him from the walls, say, \"Each of us was\\na passing reality here and left this coloured shadow of himself and\\nmelted into remembrance as dreamy as the distant voices of the rooks\\nnow lulling you to rest,\" and hear their testimony to his greatness\\ntoo. And he is very great this day. And woe to Boythorn or other\\ndaring wight who shall presumptuously contest an inch with him!\\n\\nMy Lady is at present represented, near Sir Leicester, by her\\nportrait. She has flitted away to town, with no intention of\\nremaining there, and will soon flit hither again, to the confusion of\\nthe fashionable intelligence. The house in town is not prepared for\\nher reception. It is muffled and dreary. Only one Mercury in powder\\ngapes disconsolate at the hall-window; and he mentioned last night to\\nanother Mercury of his acquaintance, also accustomed to good society,\\nthat if that sort of thing was to last--which it couldn\\'t, for a man\\nof his spirits couldn\\'t bear it, and a man of his figure couldn\\'t be\\nexpected to bear it--there would be no resource for him, upon his\\nhonour, but to cut his throat!\\n\\nWhat connexion can there be between the place in Lincolnshire, the\\nhouse in town, the Mercury in powder, and the whereabout of Jo the\\noutlaw with the broom, who had that distant ray of light upon him\\nwhen he swept the churchyard-step? What connexion can there have been\\nbetween many people in the innumerable histories of this world who\\nfrom opposite sides of great gulfs have, nevertheless, been very\\ncuriously brought together!\\n\\nJo sweeps his crossing all day long, unconscious of the link, if any\\nlink there be. He sums up his mental condition when asked a question\\nby replying that he \"don\\'t know nothink.\" He knows that it\\'s hard to\\nkeep the mud off the crossing in dirty weather, and harder still to\\nlive by doing it. Nobody taught him even that much; he found it out.\\n\\nJo lives--that is to say, Jo has not yet died--in a ruinous place\\nknown to the like of him by the name of Tom-all-Alone\\'s. It is a\\nblack, dilapidated street, avoided by all decent people, where the\\ncrazy houses were seized upon, when their decay was far advanced, by\\nsome bold vagrants who after establishing their own possession took\\nto letting them out in lodgings. Now, these tumbling tenements\\ncontain, by night, a swarm of misery. As on the ruined human wretch\\nvermin parasites appear, so these ruined shelters have bred a crowd\\nof foul existence that crawls in and out of gaps in walls and boards;\\nand coils itself to sleep, in maggot numbers, where the rain drips\\nin; and comes and goes, fetching and carrying fever and sowing more\\nevil in its every footprint than Lord Coodle, and Sir Thomas Doodle,\\nand the Duke of Foodle, and all the fine gentlemen in office, down to\\nZoodle, shall set right in five hundred years--though born expressly\\nto do it.\\n\\nTwice lately there has been a crash and a cloud of dust, like the\\nspringing of a mine, in Tom-all-Alone\\'s; and each time a house has\\nfallen. These accidents have made a paragraph in the newspapers and\\nhave filled a bed or two in the nearest hospital. The gaps remain,\\nand there are not unpopular lodgings among the rubbish. As several\\nmore houses are nearly ready to go, the next crash in Tom-all-Alone\\'s\\nmay be expected to be a good one.\\n\\nThis desirable property is in Chancery, of course. It would be an\\ninsult to the discernment of any man with half an eye to tell him so.\\nWhether \"Tom\" is the popular representative of the original plaintiff\\nor defendant in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, or whether Tom lived here when\\nthe suit had laid the street waste, all alone, until other settlers\\ncame to join him, or whether the traditional title is a comprehensive\\nname for a retreat cut off from honest company and put out of the\\npale of hope, perhaps nobody knows. Certainly Jo don\\'t know.\\n\\n\"For I don\\'t,\" says Jo, \"I don\\'t know nothink.\"\\n\\nIt must be a strange state to be like Jo! To shuffle through the\\nstreets, unfamiliar with the shapes, and in utter darkness as to the\\nmeaning, of those mysterious symbols, so abundant over the shops, and\\nat the corners of streets, and on the doors, and in the windows! To\\nsee people read, and to see people write, and to see the postmen\\ndeliver letters, and not to have the least idea of all that\\nlanguage--to be, to every scrap of it, stone blind and dumb! It must\\nbe very puzzling to see the good company going to the churches on\\nSundays, with their books in their hands, and to think (for perhaps\\nJo DOES think at odd times) what does it all mean, and if it means\\nanything to anybody, how comes it that it means nothing to me? To be\\nhustled, and jostled, and moved on; and really to feel that it would\\nappear to be perfectly true that I have no business here, or there,\\nor anywhere; and yet to be perplexed by the consideration that I AM\\nhere somehow, too, and everybody overlooked me until I became the\\ncreature that I am! It must be a strange state, not merely to be told\\nthat I am scarcely human (as in the case of my offering myself for a\\nwitness), but to feel it of my own knowledge all my life! To see the\\nhorses, dogs, and cattle go by me and to know that in ignorance I\\nbelong to them and not to the superior beings in my shape, whose\\ndelicacy I offend! Jo\\'s ideas of a criminal trial, or a judge, or a\\nbishop, or a government, or that inestimable jewel to him (if he only\\nknew it) the Constitution, should be strange! His whole material and\\nimmaterial life is wonderfully strange; his death, the strangest\\nthing of all.\\n\\nJo comes out of Tom-all-Alone\\'s, meeting the tardy morning which is\\nalways late in getting down there, and munches his dirty bit of bread\\nas he comes along. His way lying through many streets, and the houses\\nnot yet being open, he sits down to breakfast on the door-step of the\\nSociety for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and gives\\nit a brush when he has finished as an acknowledgment of the\\naccommodation. He admires the size of the edifice and wonders what\\nit\\'s all about. He has no idea, poor wretch, of the spiritual\\ndestitution of a coral reef in the Pacific or what it costs to look\\nup the precious souls among the coco-nuts and bread-fruit.\\n\\nHe goes to his crossing and begins to lay it out for the day. The\\ntown awakes; the great tee-totum is set up for its daily spin and\\nwhirl; all that unaccountable reading and writing, which has been\\nsuspended for a few hours, recommences. Jo and the other lower\\nanimals get on in the unintelligible mess as they can. It is\\nmarket-day. The blinded oxen, over-goaded, over-driven, never guided,\\nrun into wrong places and are beaten out, and plunge red-eyed and\\nfoaming at stone walls, and often sorely hurt the innocent, and often\\nsorely hurt themselves. Very like Jo and his order; very, very like!\\n\\nA band of music comes and plays. Jo listens to it. So does a dog--a\\ndrover\\'s dog, waiting for his master outside a butcher\\'s shop, and\\nevidently thinking about those sheep he has had upon his mind for\\nsome hours and is happily rid of. He seems perplexed respecting three\\nor four, can\\'t remember where he left them, looks up and down the\\nstreet as half expecting to see them astray, suddenly pricks up his\\nears and remembers all about it. A thoroughly vagabond dog,\\naccustomed to low company and public-houses; a terrific dog to sheep,\\nready at a whistle to scamper over their backs and tear out mouthfuls\\nof their wool; but an educated, improved, developed dog who has been\\ntaught his duties and knows how to discharge them. He and Jo listen\\nto the music, probably with much the same amount of animal\\nsatisfaction; likewise as to awakened association, aspiration, or\\nregret, melancholy or joyful reference to things beyond the senses,\\nthey are probably upon a par. But, otherwise, how far above the human\\nlistener is the brute!\\n\\nTurn that dog\\'s descendants wild, like Jo, and in a very few years\\nthey will so degenerate that they will lose even their bark--but not\\ntheir bite.\\n\\nThe day changes as it wears itself away and becomes dark and drizzly.\\nJo fights it out at his crossing among the mud and wheels, the\\nhorses, whips, and umbrellas, and gets but a scanty sum to pay for\\nthe unsavoury shelter of Tom-all-Alone\\'s. Twilight comes on; gas\\nbegins to start up in the shops; the lamplighter, with his ladder,\\nruns along the margin of the pavement. A wretched evening is\\nbeginning to close in.\\n\\nIn his chambers Mr. Tulkinghorn sits meditating an application to the\\nnearest magistrate to-morrow morning for a warrant. Gridley, a\\ndisappointed suitor, has been here to-day and has been alarming. We\\nare not to be put in bodily fear, and that ill-conditioned fellow\\nshall be held to bail again. From the ceiling, foreshortened\\nAllegory, in the person of one impossible Roman upside down, points\\nwith the arm of Samson (out of joint, and an odd one) obtrusively\\ntoward the window. Why should Mr. Tulkinghorn, for such no reason,\\nlook out of window? Is the hand not always pointing there? So he does\\nnot look out of window.\\n\\nAnd if he did, what would it be to see a woman going by? There are\\nwomen enough in the world, Mr. Tulkinghorn thinks--too many; they are\\nat the bottom of all that goes wrong in it, though, for the matter of\\nthat, they create business for lawyers. What would it be to see a\\nwoman going by, even though she were going secretly? They are all\\nsecret. Mr. Tulkinghorn knows that very well.\\n\\nBut they are not all like the woman who now leaves him and his house\\nbehind, between whose plain dress and her refined manner there is\\nsomething exceedingly inconsistent. She should be an upper servant by\\nher attire, yet in her air and step, though both are hurried and\\nassumed--as far as she can assume in the muddy streets, which she\\ntreads with an unaccustomed foot--she is a lady. Her face is veiled,\\nand still she sufficiently betrays herself to make more than one of\\nthose who pass her look round sharply.\\n\\nShe never turns her head. Lady or servant, she has a purpose in her\\nand can follow it. She never turns her head until she comes to the\\ncrossing where Jo plies with his broom. He crosses with her and begs.\\nStill, she does not turn her head until she has landed on the other\\nside. Then she slightly beckons to him and says, \"Come here!\"\\n\\nJo follows her a pace or two into a quiet court.\\n\\n\"Are you the boy I\\'ve read of in the papers?\" she asked behind her\\nveil.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" says Jo, staring moodily at the veil, \"nothink about\\nno papers. I don\\'t know nothink about nothink at all.\"\\n\\n\"Were you examined at an inquest?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know nothink about no--where I was took by the beadle, do\\nyou mean?\" says Jo. \"Was the boy\\'s name at the inkwhich Jo?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s me!\" says Jo.\\n\\n\"Come farther up.\"\\n\\n\"You mean about the man?\" says Jo, following. \"Him as wos dead?\"\\n\\n\"Hush! Speak in a whisper! Yes. Did he look, when he was living, so\\nvery ill and poor?\"\\n\\n\"Oh, jist!\" says Jo.\\n\\n\"Did he look like--not like YOU?\" says the woman with abhorrence.\\n\\n\"Oh, not so bad as me,\" says Jo. \"I\\'m a reg\\'lar one I am! You didn\\'t\\nknow him, did you?\"\\n\\n\"How dare you ask me if I knew him?\"\\n\\n\"No offence, my lady,\" says Jo with much humility, for even he has\\ngot at the suspicion of her being a lady.\\n\\n\"I am not a lady. I am a servant.\"\\n\\n\"You are a jolly servant!\" says Jo without the least idea of saying\\nanything offensive, merely as a tribute of admiration.\\n\\n\"Listen and be silent. Don\\'t talk to me, and stand farther from me!\\nCan you show me all those places that were spoken of in the account I\\nread? The place he wrote for, the place he died at, the place where\\nyou were taken to, and the place where he was buried? Do you know the\\nplace where he was buried?\"\\n\\nJo answers with a nod, having also nodded as each other place was\\nmentioned.\\n\\n\"Go before me and show me all those dreadful places. Stop opposite to\\neach, and don\\'t speak to me unless I speak to you. Don\\'t look back.\\nDo what I want, and I will pay you well.\"\\n\\nJo attends closely while the words are being spoken; tells them off\\non his broom-handle, finding them rather hard; pauses to consider\\ntheir meaning; considers it satisfactory; and nods his ragged head.\\n\\n\"I\\'m fly,\" says Jo. \"But fen larks, you know. Stow hooking it!\"\\n\\n\"What does the horrible creature mean?\" exclaims the servant,\\nrecoiling from him.\\n\\n\"Stow cutting away, you know!\" says Jo.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand you. Go on before! I will give you more money\\nthan you ever had in your life.\"\\n\\nJo screws up his mouth into a whistle, gives his ragged head a rub,\\ntakes his broom under his arm, and leads the way, passing deftly with\\nhis bare feet over the hard stones and through the mud and mire.\\n\\nCook\\'s Court. Jo stops. A pause.\\n\\n\"Who lives here?\"\\n\\n\"Him wot give him his writing and give me half a bull,\" says Jo in a\\nwhisper without looking over his shoulder.\\n\\n\"Go on to the next.\"\\n\\nKrook\\'s house. Jo stops again. A longer pause.\\n\\n\"Who lives here?\"\\n\\n\"HE lived here,\" Jo answers as before.\\n\\nAfter a silence he is asked, \"In which room?\"\\n\\n\"In the back room up there. You can see the winder from this corner.\\nUp there! That\\'s where I see him stritched out. This is the\\npublic-ouse where I was took to.\"\\n\\n\"Go on to the next!\"\\n\\nIt is a longer walk to the next, but Jo, relieved of his first\\nsuspicions, sticks to the forms imposed upon him and does not look\\nround. By many devious ways, reeking with offence of many kinds, they\\ncome to the little tunnel of a court, and to the gas-lamp (lighted\\nnow), and to the iron gate.\\n\\n\"He was put there,\" says Jo, holding to the bars and looking in.\\n\\n\"Where? Oh, what a scene of horror!\"\\n\\n\"There!\" says Jo, pointing. \"Over yinder. Among them piles of bones,\\nand close to that there kitchin winder! They put him wery nigh the\\ntop. They was obliged to stamp upon it to git it in. I could unkiver\\nit for you with my broom if the gate was open. That\\'s why they locks\\nit, I s\\'pose,\" giving it a shake. \"It\\'s always locked. Look at the\\nrat!\" cries Jo, excited. \"Hi! Look! There he goes! Ho! Into the\\nground!\"\\n\\nThe servant shrinks into a corner, into a corner of that hideous\\narchway, with its deadly stains contaminating her dress; and putting\\nout her two hands and passionately telling him to keep away from her,\\nfor he is loathsome to her, so remains for some moments. Jo stands\\nstaring and is still staring when she recovers herself.\\n\\n\"Is this place of abomination consecrated ground?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know nothink of consequential ground,\" says Jo, still\\nstaring.\\n\\n\"Is it blessed?\"\\n\\n\"Which?\" says Jo, in the last degree amazed.\\n\\n\"Is it blessed?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m blest if I know,\" says Jo, staring more than ever; \"but I\\nshouldn\\'t think it warn\\'t. Blest?\" repeats Jo, something troubled in\\nhis mind. \"It an\\'t done it much good if it is. Blest? I should think\\nit was t\\'othered myself. But I don\\'t know nothink!\"\\n\\nThe servant takes as little heed of what he says as she seems to take\\nof what she has said herself. She draws off her glove to get some\\nmoney from her purse. Jo silently notices how white and small her\\nhand is and what a jolly servant she must be to wear such sparkling\\nrings.\\n\\nShe drops a piece of money in his hand without touching it, and\\nshuddering as their hands approach. \"Now,\" she adds, \"show me the\\nspot again!\"\\n\\nJo thrusts the handle of his broom between the bars of the gate, and\\nwith his utmost power of elaboration, points it out. At length,\\nlooking aside to see if he has made himself intelligible, he finds\\nthat he is alone.\\n\\nHis first proceeding is to hold the piece of money to the gas-light\\nand to be overpowered at finding that it is yellow--gold. His next is\\nto give it a one-sided bite at the edge as a test of its quality.\\nHis next, to put it in his mouth for safety and to sweep the\\nstep and passage with great care. His job done, he sets off for\\nTom-all-Alone\\'s, stopping in the light of innumerable gas-lamps to\\nproduce the piece of gold and give it another one-sided bite as a\\nreassurance of its being genuine.\\n\\nThe Mercury in powder is in no want of society to-night, for my Lady\\ngoes to a grand dinner and three or four balls. Sir Leicester is\\nfidgety down at Chesney Wold, with no better company than the gout;\\nhe complains to Mrs. Rouncewell that the rain makes such a monotonous\\npattering on the terrace that he can\\'t read the paper even by the\\nfireside in his own snug dressing-room.\\n\\n\"Sir Leicester would have done better to try the other side of the\\nhouse, my dear,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell to Rosa. \"His dressing-room is\\non my Lady\\'s side. And in all these years I never heard the step upon\\nthe Ghost\\'s Walk more distinct than it is to-night!\"\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'model_output': \"The chapters describe several events and characters from Charles Dickens' novel Bleak House. Richard Carstone leaves to pursue a law career, entrusting Ada to Esther's care. Richard and Ada are engaged but Ada doubts relying on Richard's inheritance case. Esther visits the chaotic Jellyby home, where the children are neglected as Mrs. Jellyby focuses on philanthropy. Caddy Jellyby is engaged to Mr. Turveydrop of a dancing academy, though his father cares only for appearances. Esther, Ada and Jarndyce visit Gridley, despairing after years in the court system, and the Coavinses' neglected children. Esther and Ada meet the ignorant street sweeper Jo, who shows them grim inquest places. Lady Dedlock acts restless and is often absent. Sir Leicester has gout at home. Lawyer Tulkinghorn is suspicious of Lady Dedlock's activities. Overall, the chapters portray the bleakness of Chancery cases through characters like Gridley and introduce key figures like the Dedlocks, while advancing the plot through events like Caddy's engagement and Richard's career pursuit.\"}, {'summary': '\\nCaddy Jellyby has spent the night in Esther and Ada\\'s room, sleeping near Esther in a fit of despair. Before breakfast, she proposes a walk, and all the young people agree. Esther again shows kindness to Peepy, washing him and putting him to sleep in her bed. Esther, Ada, Caddy, and Richard take their first walk about London.\\n\\nThey soon meet Miss Flite again, who begs them to come to her lodgings. They go and visit Krook\\'s rag-and-bottle shop, above which is Miss Flite\\'s room. As they enter, Esther sees a legal handwritten advertisement for Mr. Nemo, requesting work as a law writer (copyist). Neither Esther nor we yet know it, but she is looking at the handwriting of her father and entering the house where he lives.\\n\\nThe group meets Mr. Krook, who is obsessed with Chancery documents. He rambles on about the Jarndyce suit, mentioning the names Barbary, Clare, and Dedlock, giving Esther, unaware, two more names of her mysterious parentage. They see Miss Flite\\'s bare and sad room, and Richard surreptitiously leaves some money for her. They return to the Jellyby house, much affected by the sad states to which Chancery can reduce people.\\n\\nIn Chapter 6, the long awaited meeting with Mr. Jarndyce happens at his home, Bleak House. He is described as a handsome, robust man in his 50s -- exceedingly kindly, genteel, and self-effacing. He has a little quirk of mentioning the \"east wind\" whenever something he doesn\\'t like is brought up. The three young people instantly like and feel affection for their mutual benefactor.\\n\\nA \"perfect child\" is abruptly introduced -- the parasitic poet, Mr. Skimpole. The three young people are instantly brought into his inbroglios when the bailiff, a man called Neckett, arrives and demands payment of a debt. Richard and Esther come to the rescue, and, upon learning of it, Mr. Jarndyce warns them not to give money to Skimpole.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, Esther is given the keys to the household, the mark of the housekeeper of Bleak House. She is excited and honored to have this position. She sets up residence in a room adjoining Ada\\'s, with a sitting room in between, and everything in the house is to the young people\\'s liking.\\n\\nChapter 7 is back in Chesney Wold. Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock have left for Paris. The rain continues, and Mrs. Rouncewell, the aged housekeeper, is introduced. She is instructing a young village girl of considerable beauty in the ways of housekeeping and maid\\'s work in a great house. Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s grandson, Watt, who loves Rosa, is visiting.\\n\\nIn the midst of the rain a couple of visitors come to see the house, but are told it \"isn\\'t the day\". They persist, and are admitted, by using Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s name. Mr. Guppy and his friend are brought through the house, and Mr. Guppy admires a portrait of Lady Dedlock. He exclaims that he must have seen the subject somewhere before. Guppy, who had met Esther Summerson briefly in London at Kenge and Carboy\\'s, is unconsciously remembering Lady Dedlock\\'s resemblence to Esther. Guppy leaves a bit perplexed.\\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell had refused to tell the family ghost story, but now recounts it to her grandson and her charge, Rosa. The Ghost\\'s Walk is a terraced walk outside the house, and an eerie footstep is often heard echoing from it. It is supposed that two hundred years ago, a previous Lady Dedlock had sabotaged horses meant for Cavaliers fighting Cromwellian forces. She had lamed them, and, upon being discovered, was lamed herself by her husband in a struggle. She was limping on the terrace and fell and died, and she vowed to haunt the terrace until \"the pride of the house is tumbled.\" Watt and Rosa can still hear the phantom footsteps. ', 'text': 'Although the morning was raw, and although the fog still seemed\\nheavy--I say seemed, for the windows were so encrusted with dirt that\\nthey would have made midsummer sunshine dim--I was sufficiently\\nforewarned of the discomfort within doors at that early hour and\\nsufficiently curious about London to think it a good idea on the part\\nof Miss Jellyby when she proposed that we should go out for a walk.\\n\\n\"Ma won\\'t be down for ever so long,\" she said, \"and then it\\'s a\\nchance if breakfast\\'s ready for an hour afterwards, they dawdle so.\\nAs to Pa, he gets what he can and goes to the office. He never has\\nwhat you would call a regular breakfast. Priscilla leaves him out the\\nloaf and some milk, when there is any, overnight. Sometimes there\\nisn\\'t any milk, and sometimes the cat drinks it. But I\\'m afraid you\\nmust be tired, Miss Summerson, and perhaps you would rather go to\\nbed.\"\\n\\n\"I am not at all tired, my dear,\" said I, \"and would much prefer to\\ngo out.\"\\n\\n\"If you\\'re sure you would,\" returned Miss Jellyby, \"I\\'ll get my\\nthings on.\"\\n\\nAda said she would go too, and was soon astir. I made a proposal to\\nPeepy, in default of being able to do anything better for him, that\\nhe should let me wash him and afterwards lay him down on my bed\\nagain. To this he submitted with the best grace possible, staring at\\nme during the whole operation as if he never had been, and never\\ncould again be, so astonished in his life--looking very miserable\\nalso, certainly, but making no complaint, and going snugly to sleep\\nas soon as it was over. At first I was in two minds about taking such\\na liberty, but I soon reflected that nobody in the house was likely\\nto notice it.\\n\\nWhat with the bustle of dispatching Peepy and the bustle of getting\\nmyself ready and helping Ada, I was soon quite in a glow. We found\\nMiss Jellyby trying to warm herself at the fire in the writing-room,\\nwhich Priscilla was then lighting with a smutty parlour candlestick,\\nthrowing the candle in to make it burn better. Everything was just as\\nwe had left it last night and was evidently intended to remain so.\\nBelow-stairs the dinner-cloth had not been taken away, but had been\\nleft ready for breakfast. Crumbs, dust, and waste-paper were all over\\nthe house. Some pewter pots and a milk-can hung on the area railings;\\nthe door stood open; and we met the cook round the corner coming out\\nof a public-house, wiping her mouth. She mentioned, as she passed us,\\nthat she had been to see what o\\'clock it was.\\n\\nBut before we met the cook, we met Richard, who was dancing up and\\ndown Thavies Inn to warm his feet. He was agreeably surprised to see\\nus stirring so soon and said he would gladly share our walk. So he\\ntook care of Ada, and Miss Jellyby and I went first. I may mention\\nthat Miss Jellyby had relapsed into her sulky manner and that I\\nreally should not have thought she liked me much unless she had told\\nme so.\\n\\n\"Where would you wish to go?\" she asked.\\n\\n\"Anywhere, my dear,\" I replied.\\n\\n\"Anywhere\\'s nowhere,\" said Miss Jellyby, stopping perversely.\\n\\n\"Let us go somewhere at any rate,\" said I.\\n\\nShe then walked me on very fast.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care!\" she said. \"Now, you are my witness, Miss Summerson, I\\nsay I don\\'t care--but if he was to come to our house with his great,\\nshining, lumpy forehead night after night till he was as old as\\nMethuselah, I wouldn\\'t have anything to say to him. Such ASSES as he\\nand Ma make of themselves!\"\\n\\n\"My dear!\" I remonstrated, in allusion to the epithet and the\\nvigorous emphasis Miss Jellyby set upon it. \"Your duty as a child--\"\\n\\n\"Oh! Don\\'t talk of duty as a child, Miss Summerson; where\\'s Ma\\'s duty\\nas a parent? All made over to the public and Africa, I suppose! Then\\nlet the public and Africa show duty as a child; it\\'s much more their\\naffair than mine. You are shocked, I dare say! Very well, so am I\\nshocked too; so we are both shocked, and there\\'s an end of it!\"\\n\\nShe walked me on faster yet.\\n\\n\"But for all that, I say again, he may come, and come, and come, and\\nI won\\'t have anything to say to him. I can\\'t bear him. If there\\'s any\\nstuff in the world that I hate and detest, it\\'s the stuff he and Ma\\ntalk. I wonder the very paving-stones opposite our house can have the\\npatience to stay there and be a witness of such inconsistencies and\\ncontradictions as all that sounding nonsense, and Ma\\'s management!\"\\n\\nI could not but understand her to refer to Mr. Quale, the young\\ngentleman who had appeared after dinner yesterday. I was saved the\\ndisagreeable necessity of pursuing the subject by Richard and Ada\\ncoming up at a round pace, laughing and asking us if we meant to run\\na race. Thus interrupted, Miss Jellyby became silent and walked\\nmoodily on at my side while I admired the long successions and\\nvarieties of streets, the quantity of people already going to and\\nfro, the number of vehicles passing and repassing, the busy\\npreparations in the setting forth of shop windows and the sweeping\\nout of shops, and the extraordinary creatures in rags secretly\\ngroping among the swept-out rubbish for pins and other refuse.\\n\\n\"So, cousin,\" said the cheerful voice of Richard to Ada behind me.\\n\"We are never to get out of Chancery! We have come by another way to\\nour place of meeting yesterday, and--by the Great Seal, here\\'s the\\nold lady again!\"\\n\\nTruly, there she was, immediately in front of us, curtsying, and\\nsmiling, and saying with her yesterday\\'s air of patronage, \"The wards\\nin Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy, I am sure!\"\\n\\n\"You are out early, ma\\'am,\" said I as she curtsied to me.\\n\\n\"Ye-es! I usually walk here early. Before the court sits. It\\'s\\nretired. I collect my thoughts here for the business of the day,\"\\nsaid the old lady mincingly. \"The business of the day requires a\\ngreat deal of thought. Chancery justice is so ve-ry difficult to\\nfollow.\"\\n\\n\"Who\\'s this, Miss Summerson?\" whispered Miss Jellyby, drawing my arm\\ntighter through her own.\\n\\nThe little old lady\\'s hearing was remarkably quick. She answered for\\nherself directly.\\n\\n\"A suitor, my child. At your service. I have the honour to attend\\ncourt regularly. With my documents. Have I the pleasure of addressing\\nanother of the youthful parties in Jarndyce?\" said the old lady,\\nrecovering herself, with her head on one side, from a very low\\ncurtsy.\\n\\nRichard, anxious to atone for his thoughtlessness of yesterday,\\ngood-naturedly explained that Miss Jellyby was not connected with the\\nsuit.\\n\\n\"Ha!\" said the old lady. \"She does not expect a judgment? She will\\nstill grow old. But not so old. Oh, dear, no! This is the garden of\\nLincoln\\'s Inn. I call it my garden. It is quite a bower in the\\nsummer-time. Where the birds sing melodiously. I pass the greater\\npart of the long vacation here. In contemplation. You find the long\\nvacation exceedingly long, don\\'t you?\"\\n\\nWe said yes, as she seemed to expect us to say so.\\n\\n\"When the leaves are falling from the trees and there are no more\\nflowers in bloom to make up into nosegays for the Lord Chancellor\\'s\\ncourt,\" said the old lady, \"the vacation is fulfilled and the sixth\\nseal, mentioned in the Revelations, again prevails. Pray come and see\\nmy lodging. It will be a good omen for me. Youth, and hope, and\\nbeauty are very seldom there. It is a long, long time since I had a\\nvisit from either.\"\\n\\nShe had taken my hand, and leading me and Miss Jellyby away, beckoned\\nRichard and Ada to come too. I did not know how to excuse myself and\\nlooked to Richard for aid. As he was half amused and half curious and\\nall in doubt how to get rid of the old lady without offence, she\\ncontinued to lead us away, and he and Ada continued to follow, our\\nstrange conductress informing us all the time, with much smiling\\ncondescension, that she lived close by.\\n\\nIt was quite true, as it soon appeared. She lived so close by that we\\nhad not time to have done humouring her for a few moments before she\\nwas at home. Slipping us out at a little side gate, the old lady\\nstopped most unexpectedly in a narrow back street, part of some\\ncourts and lanes immediately outside the wall of the inn, and said,\\n\"This is my lodging. Pray walk up!\"\\n\\nShe had stopped at a shop over which was written KROOK, RAG AND\\nBOTTLE WAREHOUSE. Also, in long thin letters, KROOK, DEALER IN MARINE\\nSTORES. In one part of the window was a picture of a red paper mill\\nat which a cart was unloading a quantity of sacks of old rags. In\\nanother was the inscription BONES BOUGHT. In another, KITCHEN-STUFF\\nBOUGHT. In another, OLD IRON BOUGHT. In another, WASTE-PAPER BOUGHT.\\nIn another, LADIES\\' AND GENTLEMEN\\'S WARDROBES BOUGHT. Everything\\nseemed to be bought and nothing to be sold there. In all parts of the\\nwindow were quantities of dirty bottles--blacking bottles, medicine\\nbottles, ginger-beer and soda-water bottles, pickle bottles, wine\\nbottles, ink bottles; I am reminded by mentioning the latter that the\\nshop had in several little particulars the air of being in a legal\\nneighbourhood and of being, as it were, a dirty hanger-on and\\ndisowned relation of the law. There were a great many ink bottles.\\nThere was a little tottering bench of shabby old volumes outside the\\ndoor, labelled \"Law Books, all at 9d.\" Some of the inscriptions I\\nhave enumerated were written in law-hand, like the papers I had seen\\nin Kenge and Carboy\\'s office and the letters I had so long received\\nfrom the firm. Among them was one, in the same writing, having\\nnothing to do with the business of the shop, but announcing that a\\nrespectable man aged forty-five wanted engrossing or copying to\\nexecute with neatness and dispatch: Address to Nemo, care of Mr.\\nKrook, within. There were several second-hand bags, blue and red,\\nhanging up. A little way within the shop-door lay heaps of old\\ncrackled parchment scrolls and discoloured and dog\\'s-eared\\nlaw-papers. I could have fancied that all the rusty keys, of which\\nthere must have been hundreds huddled together as old iron, had once\\nbelonged to doors of rooms or strong chests in lawyers\\' offices. The\\nlitter of rags tumbled partly into and partly out of a one-legged\\nwooden scale, hanging without any counterpoise from a beam, might\\nhave been counsellors\\' bands and gowns torn up. One had only to\\nfancy, as Richard whispered to Ada and me while we all stood looking\\nin, that yonder bones in a corner, piled together and picked very\\nclean, were the bones of clients, to make the picture complete.\\n\\nAs it was still foggy and dark, and as the shop was blinded besides\\nby the wall of Lincoln\\'s Inn, intercepting the light within a couple\\nof yards, we should not have seen so much but for a lighted lantern\\nthat an old man in spectacles and a hairy cap was carrying about in\\nthe shop. Turning towards the door, he now caught sight of us. He was\\nshort, cadaverous, and withered, with his head sunk sideways between\\nhis shoulders and the breath issuing in visible smoke from his mouth\\nas if he were on fire within. His throat, chin, and eyebrows were so\\nfrosted with white hairs and so gnarled with veins and puckered skin\\nthat he looked from his breast upward like some old root in a fall of\\nsnow.\\n\\n\"Hi, hi!\" said the old man, coming to the door. \"Have you anything to\\nsell?\"\\n\\nWe naturally drew back and glanced at our conductress, who had been\\ntrying to open the house-door with a key she had taken from her\\npocket, and to whom Richard now said that as we had had the pleasure\\nof seeing where she lived, we would leave her, being pressed for\\ntime. But she was not to be so easily left. She became so\\nfantastically and pressingly earnest in her entreaties that we would\\nwalk up and see her apartment for an instant, and was so bent, in her\\nharmless way, on leading me in, as part of the good omen she desired,\\nthat I (whatever the others might do) saw nothing for it but to\\ncomply. I suppose we were all more or less curious; at any rate, when\\nthe old man added his persuasions to hers and said, \"Aye, aye! Please\\nher! It won\\'t take a minute! Come in, come in! Come in through the\\nshop if t\\'other door\\'s out of order!\" we all went in, stimulated by\\nRichard\\'s laughing encouragement and relying on his protection.\\n\\n\"My landlord, Krook,\" said the little old lady, condescending to him\\nfrom her lofty station as she presented him to us. \"He is called\\namong the neighbours the Lord Chancellor. His shop is called the\\nCourt of Chancery. He is a very eccentric person. He is very odd. Oh,\\nI assure you he is very odd!\"\\n\\nShe shook her head a great many times and tapped her forehead with\\nher finger to express to us that we must have the goodness to excuse\\nhim, \"For he is a little--you know--M!\" said the old lady with great\\nstateliness. The old man overheard, and laughed.\\n\\n\"It\\'s true enough,\" he said, going before us with the lantern, \"that\\nthey call me the Lord Chancellor and call my shop Chancery. And why\\ndo you think they call me the Lord Chancellor and my shop Chancery?\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, I am sure!\" said Richard rather carelessly.\\n\\n\"You see,\" said the old man, stopping and turning round, \"they--Hi!\\nHere\\'s lovely hair! I have got three sacks of ladies\\' hair below, but\\nnone so beautiful and fine as this. What colour, and what texture!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'ll do, my good friend!\" said Richard, strongly disapproving of\\nhis having drawn one of Ada\\'s tresses through his yellow hand. \"You\\ncan admire as the rest of us do without taking that liberty.\"\\n\\nThe old man darted at him a sudden look which even called my\\nattention from Ada, who, startled and blushing, was so remarkably\\nbeautiful that she seemed to fix the wandering attention of the\\nlittle old lady herself. But as Ada interposed and laughingly said\\nshe could only feel proud of such genuine admiration, Mr. Krook\\nshrunk into his former self as suddenly as he had leaped out of it.\\n\\n\"You see, I have so many things here,\" he resumed, holding up the\\nlantern, \"of so many kinds, and all as the neighbours think (but THEY\\nknow nothing), wasting away and going to rack and ruin, that that\\'s\\nwhy they have given me and my place a christening. And I have so many\\nold parchmentses and papers in my stock. And I have a liking for rust\\nand must and cobwebs. And all\\'s fish that comes to my net. And I\\ncan\\'t abear to part with anything I once lay hold of (or so my\\nneighbours think, but what do THEY know?) or to alter anything, or to\\nhave any sweeping, nor scouring, nor cleaning, nor repairing going on\\nabout me. That\\'s the way I\\'ve got the ill name of Chancery. I don\\'t\\nmind. I go to see my noble and learned brother pretty well every day,\\nwhen he sits in the Inn. He don\\'t notice me, but I notice him.\\nThere\\'s no great odds betwixt us. We both grub on in a muddle. Hi,\\nLady Jane!\"\\n\\nA large grey cat leaped from some neighbouring shelf on his shoulder\\nand startled us all.\\n\\n\"Hi! Show \\'em how you scratch. Hi! Tear, my lady!\" said her master.\\n\\nThe cat leaped down and ripped at a bundle of rags with her tigerish\\nclaws, with a sound that it set my teeth on edge to hear.\\n\\n\"She\\'d do as much for any one I was to set her on,\" said the old man.\\n\"I deal in cat-skins among other general matters, and hers was\\noffered to me. It\\'s a very fine skin, as you may see, but I didn\\'t\\nhave it stripped off! THAT warn\\'t like Chancery practice though, says\\nyou!\"\\n\\nHe had by this time led us across the shop, and now opened a door in\\nthe back part of it, leading to the house-entry. As he stood with his\\nhand upon the lock, the little old lady graciously observed to him\\nbefore passing out, \"That will do, Krook. You mean well, but are\\ntiresome. My young friends are pressed for time. I have none to spare\\nmyself, having to attend court very soon. My young friends are the\\nwards in Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Jarndyce!\" said the old man with a start.\\n\\n\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The great suit, Krook,\" returned his lodger.\\n\\n\"Hi!\" exclaimed the old man in a tone of thoughtful amazement and\\nwith a wider stare than before. \"Think of it!\"\\n\\nHe seemed so rapt all in a moment and looked so curiously at us that\\nRichard said, \"Why, you appear to trouble yourself a good deal about\\nthe causes before your noble and learned brother, the other\\nChancellor!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the old man abstractedly. \"Sure! YOUR name now will be--\"\\n\\n\"Richard Carstone.\"\\n\\n\"Carstone,\" he repeated, slowly checking off that name upon his\\nforefinger; and each of the others he went on to mention upon a\\nseparate finger. \"Yes. There was the name of Barbary, and the name of\\nClare, and the name of Dedlock, too, I think.\"\\n\\n\"He knows as much of the cause as the real salaried Chancellor!\" said\\nRichard, quite astonished, to Ada and me.\\n\\n\"Aye!\" said the old man, coming slowly out of his abstraction. \"Yes!\\nTom Jarndyce--you\\'ll excuse me, being related; but he was never known\\nabout court by any other name, and was as well known there as--she is\\nnow,\" nodding slightly at his lodger. \"Tom Jarndyce was often in\\nhere. He got into a restless habit of strolling about when the cause\\nwas on, or expected, talking to the little shopkeepers and telling\\n\\'em to keep out of Chancery, whatever they did. \\'For,\\' says he, \\'it\\'s\\nbeing ground to bits in a slow mill; it\\'s being roasted at a slow\\nfire; it\\'s being stung to death by single bees; it\\'s being drowned by\\ndrops; it\\'s going mad by grains.\\' He was as near making away with\\nhimself, just where the young lady stands, as near could be.\"\\n\\nWe listened with horror.\\n\\n\"He come in at the door,\" said the old man, slowly pointing an\\nimaginary track along the shop, \"on the day he did it--the whole\\nneighbourhood had said for months before that he would do it, of a\\ncertainty sooner or later--he come in at the door that day, and\\nwalked along there, and sat himself on a bench that stood there, and\\nasked me (you\\'ll judge I was a mortal sight younger then) to fetch\\nhim a pint of wine. \\'For,\\' says he, \\'Krook, I am much depressed; my\\ncause is on again, and I think I\\'m nearer judgment than I ever was.\\'\\nI hadn\\'t a mind to leave him alone; and I persuaded him to go to the\\ntavern over the way there, t\\'other side my lane (I mean Chancery\\nLane); and I followed and looked in at the window, and saw him,\\ncomfortable as I thought, in the arm-chair by the fire, and company\\nwith him. I hadn\\'t hardly got back here when I heard a shot go\\nechoing and rattling right away into the inn. I ran out--neighbours\\nran out--twenty of us cried at once, \\'Tom Jarndyce!\\'\"\\n\\nThe old man stopped, looked hard at us, looked down into the lantern,\\nblew the light out, and shut the lantern up.\\n\\n\"We were right, I needn\\'t tell the present hearers. Hi! To be sure,\\nhow the neighbourhood poured into court that afternoon while the\\ncause was on! How my noble and learned brother, and all the rest of\\n\\'em, grubbed and muddled away as usual and tried to look as if they\\nhadn\\'t heard a word of the last fact in the case or as if they\\nhad--Oh, dear me!--nothing at all to do with it if they had heard of\\nit by any chance!\"\\n\\nAda\\'s colour had entirely left her, and Richard was scarcely less\\npale. Nor could I wonder, judging even from my emotions, and I was no\\nparty in the suit, that to hearts so untried and fresh it was a shock\\nto come into the inheritance of a protracted misery, attended in the\\nminds of many people with such dreadful recollections. I had another\\nuneasiness, in the application of the painful story to the poor\\nhalf-witted creature who had brought us there; but, to my surprise,\\nshe seemed perfectly unconscious of that and only led the way\\nupstairs again, informing us with the toleration of a superior\\ncreature for the infirmities of a common mortal that her landlord was\\n\"a little M, you know!\"\\n\\nShe lived at the top of the house, in a pretty large room, from which\\nshe had a glimpse of Lincoln\\'s Inn Hall. This seemed to have been her\\nprincipal inducement, originally, for taking up her residence there.\\nShe could look at it, she said, in the night, especially in the\\nmoonshine. Her room was clean, but very, very bare. I noticed the\\nscantiest necessaries in the way of furniture; a few old prints from\\nbooks, of Chancellors and barristers, wafered against the wall; and\\nsome half-dozen reticles and work-bags, \"containing documents,\" as\\nshe informed us. There were neither coals nor ashes in the grate, and\\nI saw no articles of clothing anywhere, nor any kind of food. Upon a\\nshelf in an open cupboard were a plate or two, a cup or two, and so\\nforth, but all dry and empty. There was a more affecting meaning in\\nher pinched appearance, I thought as I looked round, than I had\\nunderstood before.\\n\\n\"Extremely honoured, I am sure,\" said our poor hostess with the\\ngreatest suavity, \"by this visit from the wards in Jarndyce. And very\\nmuch indebted for the omen. It is a retired situation. Considering. I\\nam limited as to situation. In consequence of the necessity of\\nattending on the Chancellor. I have lived here many years. I pass my\\ndays in court, my evenings and my nights here. I find the nights\\nlong, for I sleep but little and think much. That is, of course,\\nunavoidable, being in Chancery. I am sorry I cannot offer chocolate.\\nI expect a judgment shortly and shall then place my establishment on\\na superior footing. At present, I don\\'t mind confessing to the wards\\nin Jarndyce (in strict confidence) that I sometimes find it difficult\\nto keep up a genteel appearance. I have felt the cold here. I have\\nfelt something sharper than cold. It matters very little. Pray excuse\\nthe introduction of such mean topics.\"\\n\\nShe partly drew aside the curtain of the long, low garret window and\\ncalled our attention to a number of bird-cages hanging there, some\\ncontaining several birds. There were larks, linnets, and\\ngoldfinches--I should think at least twenty.\\n\\n\"I began to keep the little creatures,\" she said, \"with an object\\nthat the wards will readily comprehend. With the intention of\\nrestoring them to liberty. When my judgment should be given. Ye-es!\\nThey die in prison, though. Their lives, poor silly things, are so\\nshort in comparison with Chancery proceedings that, one by one, the\\nwhole collection has died over and over again. I doubt, do you know,\\nwhether one of these, though they are all young, will live to be\\nfree! Ve-ry mortifying, is it not?\"\\n\\nAlthough she sometimes asked a question, she never seemed to expect a\\nreply, but rambled on as if she were in the habit of doing so when no\\none but herself was present.\\n\\n\"Indeed,\" she pursued, \"I positively doubt sometimes, I do assure\\nyou, whether while matters are still unsettled, and the sixth or\\nGreat Seal still prevails, I may not one day be found lying stark and\\nsenseless here, as I have found so many birds!\"\\n\\nRichard, answering what he saw in Ada\\'s compassionate eyes, took the\\nopportunity of laying some money, softly and unobserved, on the\\nchimney-piece. We all drew nearer to the cages, feigning to examine\\nthe birds.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t allow them to sing much,\" said the little old lady, \"for\\n(you\\'ll think this curious) I find my mind confused by the idea that\\nthey are singing while I am following the arguments in court. And my\\nmind requires to be so very clear, you know! Another time, I\\'ll tell\\nyou their names. Not at present. On a day of such good omen, they\\nshall sing as much as they like. In honour of youth,\" a smile and\\ncurtsy, \"hope,\" a smile and curtsy, \"and beauty,\" a smile and curtsy.\\n\"There! We\\'ll let in the full light.\"\\n\\nThe birds began to stir and chirp.\\n\\n\"I cannot admit the air freely,\" said the little old lady--the room\\nwas close, and would have been the better for it--\"because the cat\\nyou saw downstairs, called Lady Jane, is greedy for their lives. She\\ncrouches on the parapet outside for hours and hours. I have\\ndiscovered,\" whispering mysteriously, \"that her natural cruelty is\\nsharpened by a jealous fear of their regaining their liberty. In\\nconsequence of the judgment I expect being shortly given. She is sly\\nand full of malice. I half believe, sometimes, that she is no cat,\\nbut the wolf of the old saying. It is so very difficult to keep her\\nfrom the door.\"\\n\\nSome neighbouring bells, reminding the poor soul that it was\\nhalf-past nine, did more for us in the way of bringing our visit to\\nan end than we could easily have done for ourselves. She hurriedly\\ntook up her little bag of documents, which she had laid upon the\\ntable on coming in, and asked if we were also going into court. On\\nour answering no, and that we would on no account detain her, she\\nopened the door to attend us downstairs.\\n\\n\"With such an omen, it is even more necessary than usual that I\\nshould be there before the Chancellor comes in,\" said she, \"for he\\nmight mention my case the first thing. I have a presentiment that he\\nWILL mention it the first thing this morning.\"\\n\\nShe stopped to tell us in a whisper as we were going down that the\\nwhole house was filled with strange lumber which her landlord had\\nbought piecemeal and had no wish to sell, in consequence of being a\\nlittle M. This was on the first floor. But she had made a previous\\nstoppage on the second floor and had silently pointed at a dark door\\nthere.\\n\\n\"The only other lodger,\" she now whispered in explanation, \"a\\nlaw-writer. The children in the lanes here say he has sold himself to\\nthe devil. I don\\'t know what he can have done with the money. Hush!\"\\n\\nShe appeared to mistrust that the lodger might hear her even there,\\nand repeating \"Hush!\" went before us on tiptoe as though even the\\nsound of her footsteps might reveal to him what she had said.\\n\\nPassing through the shop on our way out, as we had passed through it\\non our way in, we found the old man storing a quantity of packets of\\nwaste-paper in a kind of well in the floor. He seemed to be working\\nhard, with the perspiration standing on his forehead, and had a piece\\nof chalk by him, with which, as he put each separate package or\\nbundle down, he made a crooked mark on the panelling of the wall.\\n\\nRichard and Ada, and Miss Jellyby, and the little old lady had gone\\nby him, and I was going when he touched me on the arm to stay me, and\\nchalked the letter J upon the wall--in a very curious manner,\\nbeginning with the end of the letter and shaping it backward. It was\\na capital letter, not a printed one, but just such a letter as any\\nclerk in Messrs. Kenge and Carboy\\'s office would have made.\\n\\n\"Can you read it?\" he asked me with a keen glance.\\n\\n\"Surely,\" said I. \"It\\'s very plain.\"\\n\\n\"What is it?\"\\n\\n\"J.\"\\n\\nWith another glance at me, and a glance at the door, he rubbed it out\\nand turned an \"a\" in its place (not a capital letter this time), and\\nsaid, \"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\nI told him. He then rubbed that out and turned the letter \"r,\" and\\nasked me the same question. He went on quickly until he had formed in\\nthe same curious manner, beginning at the ends and bottoms of the\\nletters, the word Jarndyce, without once leaving two letters on the\\nwall together.\\n\\n\"What does that spell?\" he asked me.\\n\\nWhen I told him, he laughed. In the same odd way, yet with the same\\nrapidity, he then produced singly, and rubbed out singly, the letters\\nforming the words Bleak House. These, in some astonishment, I also\\nread; and he laughed again.\\n\\n\"Hi!\" said the old man, laying aside the chalk. \"I have a turn for\\ncopying from memory, you see, miss, though I can neither read nor\\nwrite.\"\\n\\nHe looked so disagreeable and his cat looked so wickedly at me, as if\\nI were a blood-relation of the birds upstairs, that I was quite\\nrelieved by Richard\\'s appearing at the door and saying, \"Miss\\nSummerson, I hope you are not bargaining for the sale of your hair.\\nDon\\'t be tempted. Three sacks below are quite enough for Mr. Krook!\"\\n\\nI lost no time in wishing Mr. Krook good morning and joining my\\nfriends outside, where we parted with the little old lady, who gave\\nus her blessing with great ceremony and renewed her assurance of\\nyesterday in reference to her intention of settling estates on Ada\\nand me. Before we finally turned out of those lanes, we looked back\\nand saw Mr. Krook standing at his shop-door, in his spectacles,\\nlooking after us, with his cat upon his shoulder, and her tail\\nsticking up on one side of his hairy cap like a tall feather.\\n\\n\"Quite an adventure for a morning in London!\" said Richard with a\\nsigh. \"Ah, cousin, cousin, it\\'s a weary word this Chancery!\"\\n\\n\"It is to me, and has been ever since I can remember,\" returned Ada.\\n\"I am grieved that I should be the enemy--as I suppose I am--of a\\ngreat number of relations and others, and that they should be my\\nenemies--as I suppose they are--and that we should all be ruining one\\nanother without knowing how or why and be in constant doubt and\\ndiscord all our lives. It seems very strange, as there must be right\\nsomewhere, that an honest judge in real earnest has not been able to\\nfind out through all these years where it is.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, cousin!\" said Richard. \"Strange, indeed! All this wasteful,\\nwanton chess-playing IS very strange. To see that composed court\\nyesterday jogging on so serenely and to think of the wretchedness of\\nthe pieces on the board gave me the headache and the heartache both\\ntogether. My head ached with wondering how it happened, if men were\\nneither fools nor rascals; and my heart ached to think they could\\npossibly be either. But at all events, Ada--I may call you Ada?\"\\n\\n\"Of course you may, cousin Richard.\"\\n\\n\"At all events, Chancery will work none of its bad influences on US.\\nWe have happily been brought together, thanks to our good kinsman,\\nand it can\\'t divide us now!\"\\n\\n\"Never, I hope, cousin Richard!\" said Ada gently.\\n\\nMiss Jellyby gave my arm a squeeze and me a very significant look. I\\nsmiled in return, and we made the rest of the way back very\\npleasantly.\\n\\nIn half an hour after our arrival, Mrs. Jellyby appeared; and in the\\ncourse of an hour the various things necessary for breakfast\\nstraggled one by one into the dining-room. I do not doubt that Mrs.\\nJellyby had gone to bed and got up in the usual manner, but she\\npresented no appearance of having changed her dress. She was greatly\\noccupied during breakfast, for the morning\\'s post brought a heavy\\ncorrespondence relative to Borrioboola-Gha, which would occasion her\\n(she said) to pass a busy day. The children tumbled about, and\\nnotched memoranda of their accidents in their legs, which were\\nperfect little calendars of distress; and Peepy was lost for an hour\\nand a half, and brought home from Newgate market by a policeman. The\\nequable manner in which Mrs. Jellyby sustained both his absence and\\nhis restoration to the family circle surprised us all.\\n\\nShe was by that time perseveringly dictating to Caddy, and Caddy was\\nfast relapsing into the inky condition in which we had found her. At\\none o\\'clock an open carriage arrived for us, and a cart for our\\nluggage. Mrs. Jellyby charged us with many remembrances to her good\\nfriend Mr. Jarndyce; Caddy left her desk to see us depart, kissed me\\nin the passage, and stood biting her pen and sobbing on the steps;\\nPeepy, I am happy to say, was asleep and spared the pain of\\nseparation (I was not without misgivings that he had gone to Newgate\\nmarket in search of me); and all the other children got up behind the\\nbarouche and fell off, and we saw them, with great concern, scattered\\nover the surface of Thavies Inn as we rolled out of its precincts.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe day had brightened very much, and still brightened as we went\\nwestward. We went our way through the sunshine and the fresh air,\\nwondering more and more at the extent of the streets, the brilliancy\\nof the shops, the great traffic, and the crowds of people whom the\\npleasanter weather seemed to have brought out like many-coloured\\nflowers. By and by we began to leave the wonderful city and to\\nproceed through suburbs which, of themselves, would have made a\\npretty large town in my eyes; and at last we got into a real country\\nroad again, with windmills, rick-yards, milestones, farmers\\' waggons,\\nscents of old hay, swinging signs, and horse troughs: trees, fields,\\nand hedge-rows. It was delightful to see the green landscape before\\nus and the immense metropolis behind; and when a waggon with a train\\nof beautiful horses, furnished with red trappings and clear-sounding\\nbells, came by us with its music, I believe we could all three have\\nsung to the bells, so cheerful were the influences around.\\n\\n\"The whole road has been reminding me of my namesake Whittington,\"\\nsaid Richard, \"and that waggon is the finishing touch. Halloa! What\\'s\\nthe matter?\"\\n\\nWe had stopped, and the waggon had stopped too. Its music changed as\\nthe horses came to a stand, and subsided to a gentle tinkling, except\\nwhen a horse tossed his head or shook himself and sprinkled off a\\nlittle shower of bell-ringing.\\n\\n\"Our postilion is looking after the waggoner,\" said Richard, \"and the\\nwaggoner is coming back after us. Good day, friend!\" The waggoner was\\nat our coach-door. \"Why, here\\'s an extraordinary thing!\" added\\nRichard, looking closely at the man. \"He has got your name, Ada, in\\nhis hat!\"\\n\\nHe had all our names in his hat. Tucked within the band were three\\nsmall notes--one addressed to Ada, one to Richard, one to me. These\\nthe waggoner delivered to each of us respectively, reading the name\\naloud first. In answer to Richard\\'s inquiry from whom they came, he\\nbriefly answered, \"Master, sir, if you please\"; and putting on his\\nhat again (which was like a soft bowl), cracked his whip, re-awakened\\nhis music, and went melodiously away.\\n\\n\"Is that Mr. Jarndyce\\'s waggon?\" said Richard, calling to our\\npost-boy.\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" he replied. \"Going to London.\"\\n\\nWe opened the notes. Each was a counterpart of the other and\\ncontained these words in a solid, plain hand.\\n\\n\\n   I look forward, my dear, to our meeting easily and\\n   without constraint on either side. I therefore have to\\n   propose that we meet as old friends and take the past for\\n   granted. It will be a relief to you possibly, and to me\\n   certainly, and so my love to you.\\n\\n   John Jarndyce\\n\\n\\nI had perhaps less reason to be surprised than either of my\\ncompanions, having never yet enjoyed an opportunity of thanking one\\nwho had been my benefactor and sole earthly dependence through so\\nmany years. I had not considered how I could thank him, my gratitude\\nlying too deep in my heart for that; but I now began to consider how\\nI could meet him without thanking him, and felt it would be very\\ndifficult indeed.\\n\\nThe notes revived in Richard and Ada a general impression that they\\nboth had, without quite knowing how they came by it, that their\\ncousin Jarndyce could never bear acknowledgments for any kindness he\\nperformed and that sooner than receive any he would resort to the\\nmost singular expedients and evasions or would even run away. Ada\\ndimly remembered to have heard her mother tell, when she was a very\\nlittle child, that he had once done her an act of uncommon generosity\\nand that on her going to his house to thank him, he happened to see\\nher through a window coming to the door, and immediately escaped by\\nthe back gate, and was not heard of for three months. This discourse\\nled to a great deal more on the same theme, and indeed it lasted us\\nall day, and we talked of scarcely anything else. If we did by any\\nchance diverge into another subject, we soon returned to this, and\\nwondered what the house would be like, and when we should get there,\\nand whether we should see Mr. Jarndyce as soon as we arrived or after\\na delay, and what he would say to us, and what we should say to him.\\nAll of which we wondered about, over and over again.\\n\\nThe roads were very heavy for the horses, but the pathway was\\ngenerally good, so we alighted and walked up all the hills, and liked\\nit so well that we prolonged our walk on the level ground when we got\\nto the top. At Barnet there were other horses waiting for us, but as\\nthey had only just been fed, we had to wait for them too, and got a\\nlong fresh walk over a common and an old battle-field before the\\ncarriage came up. These delays so protracted the journey that the\\nshort day was spent and the long night had closed in before we came\\nto St. Albans, near to which town Bleak House was, we knew.\\n\\nBy that time we were so anxious and nervous that even Richard\\nconfessed, as we rattled over the stones of the old street, to\\nfeeling an irrational desire to drive back again. As to Ada and me,\\nwhom he had wrapped up with great care, the night being sharp and\\nfrosty, we trembled from head to foot. When we turned out of the\\ntown, round a corner, and Richard told us that the post-boy, who had\\nfor a long time sympathized with our heightened expectation, was\\nlooking back and nodding, we both stood up in the carriage (Richard\\nholding Ada lest she should be jolted down) and gazed round upon the\\nopen country and the starlight night for our destination. There was a\\nlight sparkling on the top of a hill before us, and the driver,\\npointing to it with his whip and crying, \"That\\'s Bleak House!\" put\\nhis horses into a canter and took us forward at such a rate, uphill\\nthough it was, that the wheels sent the road drift flying about our\\nheads like spray from a water-mill. Presently we lost the light,\\npresently saw it, presently lost it, presently saw it, and turned\\ninto an avenue of trees and cantered up towards where it was beaming\\nbrightly. It was in a window of what seemed to be an old-fashioned\\nhouse with three peaks in the roof in front and a circular sweep\\nleading to the porch. A bell was rung as we drew up, and amidst the\\nsound of its deep voice in the still air, and the distant barking of\\nsome dogs, and a gush of light from the opened door, and the smoking\\nand steaming of the heated horses, and the quickened beating of our\\nown hearts, we alighted in no inconsiderable confusion.\\n\\n\"Ada, my love, Esther, my dear, you are welcome. I rejoice to see\\nyou! Rick, if I had a hand to spare at present, I would give it you!\"\\n\\nThe gentleman who said these words in a clear, bright, hospitable\\nvoice had one of his arms round Ada\\'s waist and the other round mine,\\nand kissed us both in a fatherly way, and bore us across the hall\\ninto a ruddy little room, all in a glow with a blazing fire. Here he\\nkissed us again, and opening his arms, made us sit down side by side\\non a sofa ready drawn out near the hearth. I felt that if we had been\\nat all demonstrative, he would have run away in a moment.\\n\\n\"Now, Rick!\" said he. \"I have a hand at liberty. A word in earnest is\\nas good as a speech. I am heartily glad to see you. You are at home.\\nWarm yourself!\"\\n\\nRichard shook him by both hands with an intuitive mixture of respect\\nand frankness, and only saying (though with an earnestness that\\nrather alarmed me, I was so afraid of Mr. Jarndyce\\'s suddenly\\ndisappearing), \"You are very kind, sir! We are very much obliged to\\nyou!\" laid aside his hat and coat and came up to the fire.\\n\\n\"And how did you like the ride? And how did you like Mrs. Jellyby, my\\ndear?\" said Mr. Jarndyce to Ada.\\n\\nWhile Ada was speaking to him in reply, I glanced (I need not say\\nwith how much interest) at his face. It was a handsome, lively, quick\\nface, full of change and motion; and his hair was a silvered\\niron-grey. I took him to be nearer sixty than fifty, but he was\\nupright, hearty, and robust. From the moment of his first speaking to\\nus his voice had connected itself with an association in my mind that\\nI could not define; but now, all at once, a something sudden in his\\nmanner and a pleasant expression in his eyes recalled the gentleman\\nin the stagecoach six years ago on the memorable day of my journey to\\nReading. I was certain it was he. I never was so frightened in my\\nlife as when I made the discovery, for he caught my glance, and\\nappearing to read my thoughts, gave such a look at the door that I\\nthought we had lost him.\\n\\nHowever, I am happy to say he remained where he was, and asked me\\nwhat I thought of Mrs. Jellyby.\\n\\n\"She exerts herself very much for Africa, sir,\" I said.\\n\\n\"Nobly!\" returned Mr. Jarndyce. \"But you answer like Ada.\" Whom I had\\nnot heard. \"You all think something else, I see.\"\\n\\n\"We rather thought,\" said I, glancing at Richard and Ada, who\\nentreated me with their eyes to speak, \"that perhaps she was a little\\nunmindful of her home.\"\\n\\n\"Floored!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\nI was rather alarmed again.\\n\\n\"Well! I want to know your real thoughts, my dear. I may have sent\\nyou there on purpose.\"\\n\\n\"We thought that, perhaps,\" said I, hesitating, \"it is right to begin\\nwith the obligations of home, sir; and that, perhaps, while those are\\noverlooked and neglected, no other duties can possibly be substituted\\nfor them.\"\\n\\n\"The little Jellybys,\" said Richard, coming to my relief, \"are\\nreally--I can\\'t help expressing myself strongly, sir--in a devil of a\\nstate.\"\\n\\n\"She means well,\" said Mr. Jarndyce hastily. \"The wind\\'s in the\\neast.\"\\n\\n\"It was in the north, sir, as we came down,\" observed Richard.\\n\\n\"My dear Rick,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, poking the fire, \"I\\'ll take an\\noath it\\'s either in the east or going to be. I am always conscious of\\nan uncomfortable sensation now and then when the wind is blowing in\\nthe east.\"\\n\\n\"Rheumatism, sir?\" said Richard.\\n\\n\"I dare say it is, Rick. I believe it is. And so the little Jell--I\\nhad my doubts about \\'em--are in a--oh, Lord, yes, it\\'s easterly!\"\\nsaid Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\nHe had taken two or three undecided turns up and down while uttering\\nthese broken sentences, retaining the poker in one hand and rubbing\\nhis hair with the other, with a good-natured vexation at once so\\nwhimsical and so lovable that I am sure we were more delighted with\\nhim than we could possibly have expressed in any words. He gave an\\narm to Ada and an arm to me, and bidding Richard bring a candle, was\\nleading the way out when he suddenly turned us all back again.\\n\\n\"Those little Jellybys. Couldn\\'t you--didn\\'t you--now, if it had\\nrained sugar-plums, or three-cornered raspberry tarts, or anything of\\nthat sort!\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Oh, cousin--\" Ada hastily began.\\n\\n\"Good, my pretty pet. I like cousin. Cousin John, perhaps, is\\nbetter.\"\\n\\n\"Then, cousin John--\" Ada laughingly began again.\\n\\n\"Ha, ha! Very good indeed!\" said Mr. Jarndyce with great enjoyment.\\n\"Sounds uncommonly natural. Yes, my dear?\"\\n\\n\"It did better than that. It rained Esther.\"\\n\\n\"Aye?\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"What did Esther do?\"\\n\\n\"Why, cousin John,\" said Ada, clasping her hands upon his arm and\\nshaking her head at me across him--for I wanted her to be\\nquiet--\"Esther was their friend directly. Esther nursed them, coaxed\\nthem to sleep, washed and dressed them, told them stories, kept them\\nquiet, bought them keepsakes\"--My dear girl! I had only gone out with\\nPeepy after he was found and given him a little, tiny horse!--\"and,\\ncousin John, she softened poor Caroline, the eldest one, so much and\\nwas so thoughtful for me and so amiable! No, no, I won\\'t be\\ncontradicted, Esther dear! You know, you know, it\\'s true!\"\\n\\nThe warm-hearted darling leaned across her cousin John and kissed me,\\nand then looking up in his face, boldly said, \"At all events, cousin\\nJohn, I WILL thank you for the companion you have given me.\" I felt\\nas if she challenged him to run away. But he didn\\'t.\\n\\n\"Where did you say the wind was, Rick?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"In the north as we came down, sir.\"\\n\\n\"You are right. There\\'s no east in it. A mistake of mine. Come,\\ngirls, come and see your home!\"\\n\\nIt was one of those delightfully irregular houses where you go up and\\ndown steps out of one room into another, and where you come upon more\\nrooms when you think you have seen all there are, and where there is\\na bountiful provision of little halls and passages, and where you\\nfind still older cottage-rooms in unexpected places with lattice\\nwindows and green growth pressing through them. Mine, which we\\nentered first, was of this kind, with an up-and-down roof that had\\nmore corners in it than I ever counted afterwards and a chimney\\n(there was a wood fire on the hearth) paved all around with pure\\nwhite tiles, in every one of which a bright miniature of the fire was\\nblazing. Out of this room, you went down two steps into a charming\\nlittle sitting-room looking down upon a flower-garden, which room was\\nhenceforth to belong to Ada and me. Out of this you went up three\\nsteps into Ada\\'s bedroom, which had a fine broad window commanding a\\nbeautiful view (we saw a great expanse of darkness lying underneath\\nthe stars), to which there was a hollow window-seat, in which, with a\\nspring-lock, three dear Adas might have been lost at once. Out of\\nthis room you passed into a little gallery, with which the other best\\nrooms (only two) communicated, and so, by a little staircase of\\nshallow steps with a number of corner stairs in it, considering its\\nlength, down into the hall. But if instead of going out at Ada\\'s door\\nyou came back into my room, and went out at the door by which you had\\nentered it, and turned up a few crooked steps that branched off in an\\nunexpected manner from the stairs, you lost yourself in passages,\\nwith mangles in them, and three-cornered tables, and a native Hindu\\nchair, which was also a sofa, a box, and a bedstead, and looked in\\nevery form something between a bamboo skeleton and a great bird-cage,\\nand had been brought from India nobody knew by whom or when. From\\nthese you came on Richard\\'s room, which was part library, part\\nsitting-room, part bedroom, and seemed indeed a comfortable compound\\nof many rooms. Out of that you went straight, with a little interval\\nof passage, to the plain room where Mr. Jarndyce slept, all the year\\nround, with his window open, his bedstead without any furniture\\nstanding in the middle of the floor for more air, and his cold bath\\ngaping for him in a smaller room adjoining. Out of that you came into\\nanother passage, where there were back-stairs and where you could\\nhear the horses being rubbed down outside the stable and being told\\nto \"Hold up\" and \"Get over,\" as they slipped about very much on the\\nuneven stones. Or you might, if you came out at another door (every\\nroom had at least two doors), go straight down to the hall again by\\nhalf-a-dozen steps and a low archway, wondering how you got back\\nthere or had ever got out of it.\\n\\nThe furniture, old-fashioned rather than old, like the house, was as\\npleasantly irregular. Ada\\'s sleeping-room was all flowers--in chintz\\nand paper, in velvet, in needlework, in the brocade of two stiff\\ncourtly chairs which stood, each attended by a little page of a stool\\nfor greater state, on either side of the fire-place. Our sitting-room\\nwas green and had framed and glazed upon the walls numbers of\\nsurprising and surprised birds, staring out of pictures at a real\\ntrout in a case, as brown and shining as if it had been served with\\ngravy; at the death of Captain Cook; and at the whole process of\\npreparing tea in China, as depicted by Chinese artists. In my room\\nthere were oval engravings of the months--ladies haymaking in short\\nwaists and large hats tied under the chin, for June; smooth-legged\\nnoblemen pointing with cocked-hats to village steeples, for October.\\nHalf-length portraits in crayons abounded all through the house, but\\nwere so dispersed that I found the brother of a youthful officer of\\nmine in the china-closet and the grey old age of my pretty young\\nbride, with a flower in her bodice, in the breakfast-room. As\\nsubstitutes, I had four angels, of Queen Anne\\'s reign, taking a\\ncomplacent gentleman to heaven, in festoons, with some difficulty;\\nand a composition in needlework representing fruit, a kettle, and an\\nalphabet. All the movables, from the wardrobes to the chairs and\\ntables, hangings, glasses, even to the pincushions and scent-bottles\\non the dressing-tables, displayed the same quaint variety. They\\nagreed in nothing but their perfect neatness, their display of the\\nwhitest linen, and their storing-up, wheresoever the existence of a\\ndrawer, small or large, rendered it possible, of quantities of\\nrose-leaves and sweet lavender. Such, with its illuminated windows,\\nsoftened here and there by shadows of curtains, shining out upon the\\nstarlight night; with its light, and warmth, and comfort; with its\\nhospitable jingle, at a distance, of preparations for dinner; with\\nthe face of its generous master brightening everything we saw; and\\njust wind enough without to sound a low accompaniment to everything\\nwe heard, were our first impressions of Bleak House.\\n\\n\"I am glad you like it,\" said Mr. Jarndyce when he had brought us\\nround again to Ada\\'s sitting-room. \"It makes no pretensions, but it\\nis a comfortable little place, I hope, and will be more so with such\\nbright young looks in it. You have barely half an hour before dinner.\\nThere\\'s no one here but the finest creature upon earth--a child.\"\\n\\n\"More children, Esther!\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t mean literally a child,\" pursued Mr. Jarndyce; \"not a child\\nin years. He is grown up--he is at least as old as I am--but in\\nsimplicity, and freshness, and enthusiasm, and a fine guileless\\ninaptitude for all worldly affairs, he is a perfect child.\"\\n\\nWe felt that he must be very interesting.\\n\\n\"He knows Mrs. Jellyby,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"He is a musical man, an\\namateur, but might have been a professional. He is an artist too, an\\namateur, but might have been a professional. He is a man of\\nattainments and of captivating manners. He has been unfortunate in\\nhis affairs, and unfortunate in his pursuits, and unfortunate in his\\nfamily; but he don\\'t care--he\\'s a child!\"\\n\\n\"Did you imply that he has children of his own, sir?\" inquired\\nRichard.\\n\\n\"Yes, Rick! Half-a-dozen. More! Nearer a dozen, I should think. But\\nhe has never looked after them. How could he? He wanted somebody to\\nlook after HIM. He is a child, you know!\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"And have the children looked after themselves at all, sir?\" inquired\\nRichard.\\n\\n\"Why, just as you may suppose,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, his countenance\\nsuddenly falling. \"It is said that the children of the very poor are\\nnot brought up, but dragged up. Harold Skimpole\\'s children have\\ntumbled up somehow or other. The wind\\'s getting round again, I am\\nafraid. I feel it rather!\"\\n\\nRichard observed that the situation was exposed on a sharp night.\\n\\n\"It IS exposed,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"No doubt that\\'s the cause. Bleak\\nHouse has an exposed sound. But you are coming my way. Come along!\"\\n\\nOur luggage having arrived and being all at hand, I was dressed in a\\nfew minutes and engaged in putting my worldly goods away when a maid\\n(not the one in attendance upon Ada, but another, whom I had not\\nseen) brought a basket into my room with two bunches of keys in it,\\nall labelled.\\n\\n\"For you, miss, if you please,\" said she.\\n\\n\"For me?\" said I.\\n\\n\"The housekeeping keys, miss.\"\\n\\nI showed my surprise, for she added with some little surprise on her\\nown part, \"I was told to bring them as soon as you was alone, miss.\\nMiss Summerson, if I don\\'t deceive myself?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said I. \"That is my name.\"\\n\\n\"The large bunch is the housekeeping, and the little bunch is the\\ncellars, miss. Any time you was pleased to appoint to-morrow morning,\\nI was to show you the presses and things they belong to.\"\\n\\nI said I would be ready at half-past six, and after she was gone,\\nstood looking at the basket, quite lost in the magnitude of my trust.\\nAda found me thus and had such a delightful confidence in me when I\\nshowed her the keys and told her about them that it would have been\\ninsensibility and ingratitude not to feel encouraged. I knew, to be\\nsure, that it was the dear girl\\'s kindness, but I liked to be so\\npleasantly cheated.\\n\\nWhen we went downstairs, we were presented to Mr. Skimpole, who was\\nstanding before the fire telling Richard how fond he used to be, in\\nhis school-time, of football. He was a little bright creature with a\\nrather large head, but a delicate face and a sweet voice, and there\\nwas a perfect charm in him. All he said was so free from effort and\\nspontaneous and was said with such a captivating gaiety that it was\\nfascinating to hear him talk. Being of a more slender figure than Mr.\\nJarndyce and having a richer complexion, with browner hair, he looked\\nyounger. Indeed, he had more the appearance in all respects of a\\ndamaged young man than a well-preserved elderly one. There was an\\neasy negligence in his manner and even in his dress (his hair\\ncarelessly disposed, and his neck-kerchief loose and flowing, as I\\nhave seen artists paint their own portraits) which I could not\\nseparate from the idea of a romantic youth who had undergone some\\nunique process of depreciation. It struck me as being not at all like\\nthe manner or appearance of a man who had advanced in life by the\\nusual road of years, cares, and experiences.\\n\\nI gathered from the conversation that Mr. Skimpole had been educated\\nfor the medical profession and had once lived, in his professional\\ncapacity, in the household of a German prince. He told us, however,\\nthat as he had always been a mere child in point of weights and\\nmeasures and had never known anything about them (except that they\\ndisgusted him), he had never been able to prescribe with the\\nrequisite accuracy of detail. In fact, he said, he had no head for\\ndetail. And he told us, with great humour, that when he was wanted to\\nbleed the prince or physic any of his people, he was generally found\\nlying on his back in bed, reading the newspapers or making\\nfancy-sketches in pencil, and couldn\\'t come. The prince, at last,\\nobjecting to this, \"in which,\" said Mr. Skimpole, in the frankest\\nmanner, \"he was perfectly right,\" the engagement terminated, and Mr.\\nSkimpole having (as he added with delightful gaiety) \"nothing to live\\nupon but love, fell in love, and married, and surrounded himself with\\nrosy cheeks.\" His good friend Jarndyce and some other of his good\\nfriends then helped him, in quicker or slower succession, to several\\nopenings in life, but to no purpose, for he must confess to two of\\nthe oldest infirmities in the world: one was that he had no idea of\\ntime, the other that he had no idea of money. In consequence of which\\nhe never kept an appointment, never could transact any business, and\\nnever knew the value of anything! Well! So he had got on in life, and\\nhere he was! He was very fond of reading the papers, very fond of\\nmaking fancy-sketches with a pencil, very fond of nature, very fond\\nof art. All he asked of society was to let him live. THAT wasn\\'t\\nmuch. His wants were few. Give him the papers, conversation, music,\\nmutton, coffee, landscape, fruit in the season, a few sheets of\\nBristol-board, and a little claret, and he asked no more. He was a\\nmere child in the world, but he didn\\'t cry for the moon. He said to\\nthe world, \"Go your several ways in peace! Wear red coats, blue\\ncoats, lawn sleeves; put pens behind your ears, wear aprons; go after\\nglory, holiness, commerce, trade, any object you prefer; only--let\\nHarold Skimpole live!\"\\n\\nAll this and a great deal more he told us, not only with the\\nutmost brilliancy and enjoyment, but with a certain vivacious\\ncandour--speaking of himself as if he were not at all his own affair,\\nas if Skimpole were a third person, as if he knew that Skimpole had\\nhis singularities but still had his claims too, which were the\\ngeneral business of the community and must not be slighted. He was\\nquite enchanting. If I felt at all confused at that early time in\\nendeavouring to reconcile anything he said with anything I had\\nthought about the duties and accountabilities of life (which I am far\\nfrom sure of), I was confused by not exactly understanding why he was\\nfree of them. That he WAS free of them, I scarcely doubted; he was so\\nvery clear about it himself.\\n\\n\"I covet nothing,\" said Mr. Skimpole in the same light way.\\n\"Possession is nothing to me. Here is my friend Jarndyce\\'s excellent\\nhouse. I feel obliged to him for possessing it. I can sketch it and\\nalter it. I can set it to music. When I am here, I have sufficient\\npossession of it and have neither trouble, cost, nor responsibility.\\nMy steward\\'s name, in short, is Jarndyce, and he can\\'t cheat me. We\\nhave been mentioning Mrs. Jellyby. There is a bright-eyed woman, of a\\nstrong will and immense power of business detail, who throws herself\\ninto objects with surprising ardour! I don\\'t regret that I have not a\\nstrong will and an immense power of business detail to throw myself\\ninto objects with surprising ardour. I can admire her without envy. I\\ncan sympathize with the objects. I can dream of them. I can lie down\\non the grass--in fine weather--and float along an African river,\\nembracing all the natives I meet, as sensible of the deep silence and\\nsketching the dense overhanging tropical growth as accurately as if I\\nwere there. I don\\'t know that it\\'s of any direct use my doing so, but\\nit\\'s all I can do, and I do it thoroughly. Then, for heaven\\'s sake,\\nhaving Harold Skimpole, a confiding child, petitioning you, the\\nworld, an agglomeration of practical people of business habits, to\\nlet him live and admire the human family, do it somehow or other,\\nlike good souls, and suffer him to ride his rocking-horse!\"\\n\\nIt was plain enough that Mr. Jarndyce had not been neglectful of the\\nadjuration. Mr. Skimpole\\'s general position there would have rendered\\nit so without the addition of what he presently said.\\n\\n\"It\\'s only you, the generous creatures, whom I envy,\" said Mr.\\nSkimpole, addressing us, his new friends, in an impersonal manner. \"I\\nenvy you your power of doing what you do. It is what I should revel\\nin myself. I don\\'t feel any vulgar gratitude to you. I almost feel as\\nif YOU ought to be grateful to ME for giving you the opportunity of\\nenjoying the luxury of generosity. I know you like it. For anything I\\ncan tell, I may have come into the world expressly for the purpose of\\nincreasing your stock of happiness. I may have been born to be a\\nbenefactor to you by sometimes giving you an opportunity of assisting\\nme in my little perplexities. Why should I regret my incapacity for\\ndetails and worldly affairs when it leads to such pleasant\\nconsequences? I don\\'t regret it therefore.\"\\n\\nOf all his playful speeches (playful, yet always fully meaning what\\nthey expressed) none seemed to be more to the taste of Mr. Jarndyce\\nthan this. I had often new temptations, afterwards, to wonder whether\\nit was really singular, or only singular to me, that he, who was\\nprobably the most grateful of mankind upon the least occasion, should\\nso desire to escape the gratitude of others.\\n\\nWe were all enchanted. I felt it a merited tribute to the engaging\\nqualities of Ada and Richard that Mr. Skimpole, seeing them for the\\nfirst time, should be so unreserved and should lay himself out to be\\nso exquisitely agreeable. They (and especially Richard) were\\nnaturally pleased, for similar reasons, and considered it no common\\nprivilege to be so freely confided in by such an attractive man. The\\nmore we listened, the more gaily Mr. Skimpole talked. And what with\\nhis fine hilarious manner and his engaging candour and his genial way\\nof lightly tossing his own weaknesses about, as if he had said, \"I am\\na child, you know! You are designing people compared with me\" (he\\nreally made me consider myself in that light) \"but I am gay and\\ninnocent; forget your worldly arts and play with me!\" the effect was\\nabsolutely dazzling.\\n\\nHe was so full of feeling too and had such a delicate sentiment for\\nwhat was beautiful or tender that he could have won a heart by that\\nalone. In the evening, when I was preparing to make tea and Ada was\\ntouching the piano in the adjoining room and softly humming a tune to\\nher cousin Richard, which they had happened to mention, he came and\\nsat down on the sofa near me and so spoke of Ada that I almost loved\\nhim.\\n\\n\"She is like the morning,\" he said. \"With that golden hair, those\\nblue eyes, and that fresh bloom on her cheek, she is like the summer\\nmorning. The birds here will mistake her for it. We will not call\\nsuch a lovely young creature as that, who is a joy to all mankind, an\\norphan. She is the child of the universe.\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce, I found, was standing near us with his hands behind him\\nand an attentive smile upon his face.\\n\\n\"The universe,\" he observed, \"makes rather an indifferent parent, I\\nam afraid.\"\\n\\n\"Oh! I don\\'t know!\" cried Mr. Skimpole buoyantly.\\n\\n\"I think I do know,\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Well!\" cried Mr. Skimpole. \"You know the world (which in your sense\\nis the universe), and I know nothing of it, so you shall have your\\nway. But if I had mine,\" glancing at the cousins, \"there should be no\\nbrambles of sordid realities in such a path as that. It should be\\nstrewn with roses; it should lie through bowers, where there was no\\nspring, autumn, nor winter, but perpetual summer. Age or change\\nshould never wither it. The base word money should never be breathed\\nnear it!\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce patted him on the head with a smile, as if he had been\\nreally a child, and passing a step or two on, and stopping a moment,\\nglanced at the young cousins. His look was thoughtful, but had a\\nbenignant expression in it which I often (how often!) saw again,\\nwhich has long been engraven on my heart. The room in which they\\nwere, communicating with that in which he stood, was only lighted by\\nthe fire. Ada sat at the piano; Richard stood beside her, bending\\ndown. Upon the wall, their shadows blended together, surrounded by\\nstrange forms, not without a ghostly motion caught from the unsteady\\nfire, though reflecting from motionless objects. Ada touched the\\nnotes so softly and sang so low that the wind, sighing away to the\\ndistant hills, was as audible as the music. The mystery of the future\\nand the little clue afforded to it by the voice of the present seemed\\nexpressed in the whole picture.\\n\\nBut it is not to recall this fancy, well as I remember it, that I\\nrecall the scene. First, I was not quite unconscious of the contrast\\nin respect of meaning and intention between the silent look directed\\nthat way and the flow of words that had preceded it. Secondly, though\\nMr. Jarndyce\\'s glance as he withdrew it rested for but a moment on\\nme, I felt as if in that moment he confided to me--and knew that he\\nconfided to me and that I received the confidence--his hope that Ada\\nand Richard might one day enter on a dearer relationship.\\n\\nMr. Skimpole could play on the piano and the violoncello, and he was\\na composer--had composed half an opera once, but got tired of it--and\\nplayed what he composed with taste. After tea we had quite a little\\nconcert, in which Richard--who was enthralled by Ada\\'s singing and\\ntold me that she seemed to know all the songs that ever were\\nwritten--and Mr. Jarndyce, and I were the audience. After a little\\nwhile I missed first Mr. Skimpole and afterwards Richard, and while I\\nwas thinking how could Richard stay away so long and lose so much,\\nthe maid who had given me the keys looked in at the door, saying, \"If\\nyou please, miss, could you spare a minute?\"\\n\\nWhen I was shut out with her in the hall, she said, holding up her\\nhands, \"Oh, if you please, miss, Mr. Carstone says would you come\\nupstairs to Mr. Skimpole\\'s room. He has been took, miss!\"\\n\\n\"Took?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Took, miss. Sudden,\" said the maid.\\n\\nI was apprehensive that his illness might be of a dangerous kind, but\\nof course I begged her to be quiet and not disturb any one and\\ncollected myself, as I followed her quickly upstairs, sufficiently to\\nconsider what were the best remedies to be applied if it should prove\\nto be a fit. She threw open a door and I went into a chamber, where,\\nto my unspeakable surprise, instead of finding Mr. Skimpole stretched\\nupon the bed or prostrate on the floor, I found him standing before\\nthe fire smiling at Richard, while Richard, with a face of great\\nembarrassment, looked at a person on the sofa, in a white great-coat,\\nwith smooth hair upon his head and not much of it, which he was\\nwiping smoother and making less of with a pocket-handkerchief.\\n\\n\"Miss Summerson,\" said Richard hurriedly, \"I am glad you are come.\\nYou will be able to advise us. Our friend Mr. Skimpole--don\\'t be\\nalarmed!--is arrested for debt.\"\\n\\n\"And really, my dear Miss Summerson,\" said Mr. Skimpole with his\\nagreeable candour, \"I never was in a situation in which that\\nexcellent sense and quiet habit of method and usefulness, which\\nanybody must observe in you who has the happiness of being a quarter\\nof an hour in your society, was more needed.\"\\n\\nThe person on the sofa, who appeared to have a cold in his head, gave\\nsuch a very loud snort that he startled me.\\n\\n\"Are you arrested for much, sir?\" I inquired of Mr. Skimpole.\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Summerson,\" said he, shaking his head pleasantly, \"I\\ndon\\'t know. Some pounds, odd shillings, and halfpence, I think, were\\nmentioned.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s twenty-four pound, sixteen, and sevenpence ha\\'penny,\" observed\\nthe stranger. \"That\\'s wot it is.\"\\n\\n\"And it sounds--somehow it sounds,\" said Mr. Skimpole, \"like a small\\nsum?\"\\n\\nThe strange man said nothing but made another snort. It was such a\\npowerful one that it seemed quite to lift him out of his seat.\\n\\n\"Mr. Skimpole,\" said Richard to me, \"has a delicacy in applying to my\\ncousin Jarndyce because he has lately--I think, sir, I understood you\\nthat you had lately--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes!\" returned Mr. Skimpole, smiling. \"Though I forgot how much\\nit was and when it was. Jarndyce would readily do it again, but I\\nhave the epicure-like feeling that I would prefer a novelty in help,\\nthat I would rather,\" and he looked at Richard and me, \"develop\\ngenerosity in a new soil and in a new form of flower.\"\\n\\n\"What do you think will be best, Miss Summerson?\" said Richard,\\naside.\\n\\nI ventured to inquire, generally, before replying, what would happen\\nif the money were not produced.\\n\\n\"Jail,\" said the strange man, coolly putting his handkerchief into\\nhis hat, which was on the floor at his feet. \"Or Coavinses.\"\\n\\n\"May I ask, sir, what is--\"\\n\\n\"Coavinses?\" said the strange man. \"A \\'ouse.\"\\n\\nRichard and I looked at one another again. It was a most singular\\nthing that the arrest was our embarrassment and not Mr. Skimpole\\'s.\\nHe observed us with a genial interest, but there seemed, if I may\\nventure on such a contradiction, nothing selfish in it. He had\\nentirely washed his hands of the difficulty, and it had become ours.\\n\\n\"I thought,\" he suggested, as if good-naturedly to help us out, \"that\\nbeing parties in a Chancery suit concerning (as people say) a large\\namount of property, Mr. Richard or his beautiful cousin, or both,\\ncould sign something, or make over something, or give some sort of\\nundertaking, or pledge, or bond? I don\\'t know what the business name\\nof it may be, but I suppose there is some instrument within their\\npower that would settle this?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit on it,\" said the strange man.\\n\\n\"Really?\" returned Mr. Skimpole. \"That seems odd, now, to one who is\\nno judge of these things!\"\\n\\n\"Odd or even,\" said the stranger gruffly, \"I tell you, not a bit on\\nit!\"\\n\\n\"Keep your temper, my good fellow, keep your temper!\" Mr. Skimpole\\ngently reasoned with him as he made a little drawing of his head on\\nthe fly-leaf of a book. \"Don\\'t be ruffled by your occupation. We can\\nseparate you from your office; we can separate the individual from\\nthe pursuit. We are not so prejudiced as to suppose that in private\\nlife you are otherwise than a very estimable man, with a great deal\\nof poetry in your nature, of which you may not be conscious.\"\\n\\nThe stranger only answered with another violent snort, whether in\\nacceptance of the poetry-tribute or in disdainful rejection of it, he\\ndid not express to me.\\n\\n\"Now, my dear Miss Summerson, and my dear Mr. Richard,\" said Mr.\\nSkimpole gaily, innocently, and confidingly as he looked at his\\ndrawing with his head on one side, \"here you see me utterly incapable\\nof helping myself, and entirely in your hands! I only ask to be free.\\nThe butterflies are free. Mankind will surely not deny to Harold\\nSkimpole what it concedes to the butterflies!\"\\n\\n\"My dear Miss Summerson,\" said Richard in a whisper, \"I have ten\\npounds that I received from Mr. Kenge. I must try what that will do.\"\\n\\nI possessed fifteen pounds, odd shillings, which I had saved from my\\nquarterly allowance during several years. I had always thought that\\nsome accident might happen which would throw me suddenly, without any\\nrelation or any property, on the world and had always tried to keep\\nsome little money by me that I might not be quite penniless. I told\\nRichard of my having this little store and having no present need of\\nit, and I asked him delicately to inform Mr. Skimpole, while I should\\nbe gone to fetch it, that we would have the pleasure of paying his\\ndebt.\\n\\nWhen I came back, Mr. Skimpole kissed my hand and seemed quite\\ntouched. Not on his own account (I was again aware of that perplexing\\nand extraordinary contradiction), but on ours, as if personal\\nconsiderations were impossible with him and the contemplation of our\\nhappiness alone affected him. Richard, begging me, for the greater\\ngrace of the transaction, as he said, to settle with Coavinses (as\\nMr. Skimpole now jocularly called him), I counted out the money and\\nreceived the necessary acknowledgment. This, too, delighted Mr.\\nSkimpole.\\n\\nHis compliments were so delicately administered that I blushed less\\nthan I might have done and settled with the stranger in the white\\ncoat without making any mistakes. He put the money in his pocket and\\nshortly said, \"Well, then, I\\'ll wish you a good evening, miss.\\n\\n\"My friend,\" said Mr. Skimpole, standing with his back to the fire\\nafter giving up the sketch when it was half finished, \"I should like\\nto ask you something, without offence.\"\\n\\nI think the reply was, \"Cut away, then!\"\\n\\n\"Did you know this morning, now, that you were coming out on this\\nerrand?\" said Mr. Skimpole.\\n\\n\"Know\\'d it yes\\'day aft\\'noon at tea-time,\" said Coavinses.\\n\\n\"It didn\\'t affect your appetite? Didn\\'t make you at all uneasy?\"\\n\\n\"Not a bit,\" said Coavinses. \"I know\\'d if you wos missed to-day, you\\nwouldn\\'t be missed to-morrow. A day makes no such odds.\"\\n\\n\"But when you came down here,\" proceeded Mr. Skimpole, \"it was a fine\\nday. The sun was shining, the wind was blowing, the lights and\\nshadows were passing across the fields, the birds were singing.\"\\n\\n\"Nobody said they warn\\'t, in MY hearing,\" returned Coavinses.\\n\\n\"No,\" observed Mr. Skimpole. \"But what did you think upon the road?\"\\n\\n\"Wot do you mean?\" growled Coavinses with an appearance of strong\\nresentment. \"Think! I\\'ve got enough to do, and little enough to get\\nfor it without thinking. Thinking!\" (with profound contempt).\\n\\n\"Then you didn\\'t think, at all events,\" proceeded Mr. Skimpole, \"to\\nthis effect: \\'Harold Skimpole loves to see the sun shine, loves to\\nhear the wind blow, loves to watch the changing lights and shadows,\\nloves to hear the birds, those choristers in Nature\\'s great\\ncathedral. And does it seem to me that I am about to deprive Harold\\nSkimpole of his share in such possessions, which are his only\\nbirthright!\\' You thought nothing to that effect?\"\\n\\n\"I--certainly--did--NOT,\" said Coavinses, whose doggedness in utterly\\nrenouncing the idea was of that intense kind that he could only give\\nadequate expression to it by putting a long interval between each\\nword, and accompanying the last with a jerk that might have\\ndislocated his neck.\\n\\n\"Very odd and very curious, the mental process is, in you men of\\nbusiness!\" said Mr. Skimpole thoughtfully. \"Thank you, my friend.\\nGood night.\"\\n\\nAs our absence had been long enough already to seem strange\\ndownstairs, I returned at once and found Ada sitting at work by the\\nfireside talking to her cousin John. Mr. Skimpole presently appeared,\\nand Richard shortly after him. I was sufficiently engaged during the\\nremainder of the evening in taking my first lesson in backgammon from\\nMr. Jarndyce, who was very fond of the game and from whom I wished of\\ncourse to learn it as quickly as I could in order that I might be of\\nthe very small use of being able to play when he had no better\\nadversary. But I thought, occasionally, when Mr. Skimpole played some\\nfragments of his own compositions or when, both at the piano and the\\nvioloncello, and at our table, he preserved with an absence of all\\neffort his delightful spirits and his easy flow of conversation, that\\nRichard and I seemed to retain the transferred impression of having\\nbeen arrested since dinner and that it was very curious altogether.\\n\\nIt was late before we separated, for when Ada was going at eleven\\no\\'clock, Mr. Skimpole went to the piano and rattled hilariously that\\nthe best of all ways to lengthen our days was to steal a few hours\\nfrom night, my dear! It was past twelve before he took his candle and\\nhis radiant face out of the room, and I think he might have kept us\\nthere, if he had seen fit, until daybreak. Ada and Richard were\\nlingering for a few moments by the fire, wondering whether Mrs.\\nJellyby had yet finished her dictation for the day, when Mr.\\nJarndyce, who had been out of the room, returned.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear me, what\\'s this, what\\'s this!\" he said, rubbing his head\\nand walking about with his good-humoured vexation. \"What\\'s this they\\ntell me? Rick, my boy, Esther, my dear, what have you been doing? Why\\ndid you do it? How could you do it? How much apiece was it? The\\nwind\\'s round again. I feel it all over me!\"\\n\\nWe neither of us quite knew what to answer.\\n\\n\"Come, Rick, come! I must settle this before I sleep. How much are\\nyou out of pocket? You two made the money up, you know! Why did you?\\nHow could you? Oh, Lord, yes, it\\'s due east--must be!\"\\n\\n\"Really, sir,\" said Richard, \"I don\\'t think it would be honourable in\\nme to tell you. Mr. Skimpole relied upon us--\"\\n\\n\"Lord bless you, my dear boy! He relies upon everybody!\" said Mr.\\nJarndyce, giving his head a great rub and stopping short.\\n\\n\"Indeed, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Everybody! And he\\'ll be in the same scrape again next week!\" said\\nMr. Jarndyce, walking again at a great pace, with a candle in his\\nhand that had gone out. \"He\\'s always in the same scrape. He was born\\nin the same scrape. I verily believe that the announcement in the\\nnewspapers when his mother was confined was \\'On Tuesday last, at her\\nresidence in Botheration Buildings, Mrs. Skimpole of a son in\\ndifficulties.\\'\"\\n\\nRichard laughed heartily but added, \"Still, sir, I don\\'t want to\\nshake his confidence or to break his confidence, and if I submit to\\nyour better knowledge again, that I ought to keep his secret, I hope\\nyou will consider before you press me any more. Of course, if you do\\npress me, sir, I shall know I am wrong and will tell you.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" cried Mr. Jarndyce, stopping again, and making several absent\\nendeavours to put his candlestick in his pocket. \"I--here! Take it\\naway, my dear. I don\\'t know what I am about with it; it\\'s all the\\nwind--invariably has that effect--I won\\'t press you, Rick; you may be\\nright. But really--to get hold of you and Esther--and to squeeze you\\nlike a couple of tender young Saint Michael\\'s oranges! It\\'ll blow a\\ngale in the course of the night!\"\\n\\nHe was now alternately putting his hands into his pockets as if he\\nwere going to keep them there a long time, and taking them out again\\nand vehemently rubbing them all over his head.\\n\\nI ventured to take this opportunity of hinting that Mr. Skimpole,\\nbeing in all such matters quite a child--\\n\\n\"Eh, my dear?\" said Mr. Jarndyce, catching at the word.\\n\\n\"Being quite a child, sir,\" said I, \"and so different from other\\npeople--\"\\n\\n\"You are right!\" said Mr. Jarndyce, brightening. \"Your woman\\'s wit\\nhits the mark. He is a child--an absolute child. I told you he was a\\nchild, you know, when I first mentioned him.\"\\n\\nCertainly! Certainly! we said.\\n\\n\"And he IS a child. Now, isn\\'t he?\" asked Mr. Jarndyce, brightening\\nmore and more.\\n\\nHe was indeed, we said.\\n\\n\"When you come to think of it, it\\'s the height of childishness in\\nyou--I mean me--\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to regard him for a moment as a\\nman. You can\\'t make HIM responsible. The idea of Harold Skimpole with\\ndesigns or plans, or knowledge of consequences! Ha, ha, ha!\"\\n\\nIt was so delicious to see the clouds about his bright face clearing,\\nand to see him so heartily pleased, and to know, as it was impossible\\nnot to know, that the source of his pleasure was the goodness which\\nwas tortured by condemning, or mistrusting, or secretly accusing any\\none, that I saw the tears in Ada\\'s eyes, while she echoed his laugh,\\nand felt them in my own.\\n\\n\"Why, what a cod\\'s head and shoulders I am,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to\\nrequire reminding of it! The whole business shows the child from\\nbeginning to end. Nobody but a child would have thought of singling\\nYOU two out for parties in the affair! Nobody but a child would have\\nthought of YOUR having the money! If it had been a thousand pounds,\\nit would have been just the same!\" said Mr. Jarndyce with his whole\\nface in a glow.\\n\\nWe all confirmed it from our night\\'s experience.\\n\\n\"To be sure, to be sure!\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"However, Rick, Esther,\\nand you too, Ada, for I don\\'t know that even your little purse is\\nsafe from his inexperience--I must have a promise all round that\\nnothing of this sort shall ever be done any more. No advances! Not\\neven sixpences.\"\\n\\nWe all promised faithfully, Richard with a merry glance at me\\ntouching his pocket as if to remind me that there was no danger of\\nOUR transgressing.\\n\\n\"As to Skimpole,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"a habitable doll\\'s house with\\ngood board and a few tin people to get into debt with and borrow\\nmoney of would set the boy up in life. He is in a child\\'s sleep by\\nthis time, I suppose; it\\'s time I should take my craftier head to my\\nmore worldly pillow. Good night, my dears. God bless you!\"\\n\\nHe peeped in again, with a smiling face, before we had lighted our\\ncandles, and said, \"Oh! I have been looking at the weather-cock. I\\nfind it was a false alarm about the wind. It\\'s in the south!\" And\\nwent away singing to himself.\\n\\nAda and I agreed, as we talked together for a little while upstairs,\\nthat this caprice about the wind was a fiction and that he used the\\npretence to account for any disappointment he could not conceal,\\nrather than he would blame the real cause of it or disparage or\\ndepreciate any one. We thought this very characteristic of his\\neccentric gentleness and of the difference between him and those\\npetulant people who make the weather and the winds (particularly that\\nunlucky wind which he had chosen for such a different purpose) the\\nstalking-horses of their splenetic and gloomy humours.\\n\\nIndeed, so much affection for him had been added in this one evening\\nto my gratitude that I hoped I already began to understand him\\nthrough that mingled feeling. Any seeming inconsistencies in Mr.\\nSkimpole or in Mrs. Jellyby I could not expect to be able to\\nreconcile, having so little experience or practical knowledge.\\nNeither did I try, for my thoughts were busy when I was alone, with\\nAda and Richard and with the confidence I had seemed to receive\\nconcerning them. My fancy, made a little wild by the wind perhaps,\\nwould not consent to be all unselfish, either, though I would have\\npersuaded it to be so if I could. It wandered back to my godmother\\'s\\nhouse and came along the intervening track, raising up shadowy\\nspeculations which had sometimes trembled there in the dark as to\\nwhat knowledge Mr. Jarndyce had of my earliest history--even as to\\nthe possibility of his being my father, though that idle dream was\\nquite gone now.\\n\\nIt was all gone now, I remembered, getting up from the fire. It was\\nnot for me to muse over bygones, but to act with a cheerful spirit\\nand a grateful heart. So I said to myself, \"Esther, Esther, Esther!\\nDuty, my dear!\" and gave my little basket of housekeeping keys such a\\nshake that they sounded like little bells and rang me hopefully to\\nbed.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile Esther sleeps, and while Esther wakes, it is still wet weather\\ndown at the place in Lincolnshire. The rain is ever falling--drip,\\ndrip, drip--by day and night upon the broad flagged terrace-pavement,\\nthe Ghost\\'s Walk. The weather is so very bad down in Lincolnshire\\nthat the liveliest imagination can scarcely apprehend its ever being\\nfine again. Not that there is any superabundant life of imagination\\non the spot, for Sir Leicester is not here (and, truly, even if he\\nwere, would not do much for it in that particular), but is in Paris\\nwith my Lady; and solitude, with dusky wings, sits brooding upon\\nChesney Wold.\\n\\nThere may be some motions of fancy among the lower animals at Chesney\\nWold. The horses in the stables--the long stables in a barren,\\nred-brick court-yard, where there is a great bell in a turret, and a\\nclock with a large face, which the pigeons who live near it and who\\nlove to perch upon its shoulders seem to be always consulting--THEY\\nmay contemplate some mental pictures of fine weather on occasions,\\nand may be better artists at them than the grooms. The old roan, so\\nfamous for cross-country work, turning his large eyeball to the\\ngrated window near his rack, may remember the fresh leaves that\\nglisten there at other times and the scents that stream in, and may\\nhave a fine run with the hounds, while the human helper, clearing out\\nthe next stall, never stirs beyond his pitchfork and birch-broom. The\\ngrey, whose place is opposite the door and who with an impatient\\nrattle of his halter pricks his ears and turns his head so wistfully\\nwhen it is opened, and to whom the opener says, \"Woa grey, then,\\nsteady! Noabody wants you to-day!\" may know it quite as well as the\\nman. The whole seemingly monotonous and uncompanionable half-dozen,\\nstabled together, may pass the long wet hours when the door is shut\\nin livelier communication than is held in the servants\\' hall or at\\nthe Dedlock Arms, or may even beguile the time by improving (perhaps\\ncorrupting) the pony in the loose-box in the corner.\\n\\nSo the mastiff, dozing in his kennel in the court-yard with his large\\nhead on his paws, may think of the hot sunshine when the shadows of\\nthe stable-buildings tire his patience out by changing and leave him\\nat one time of the day no broader refuge than the shadow of his own\\nhouse, where he sits on end, panting and growling short, and very\\nmuch wanting something to worry besides himself and his chain. So\\nnow, half-waking and all-winking, he may recall the house full of\\ncompany, the coach-houses full of vehicles, the stables full of\\nhorses, and the out-buildings full of attendants upon horses, until\\nhe is undecided about the present and comes forth to see how it is.\\nThen, with that impatient shake of himself, he may growl in the\\nspirit, \"Rain, rain, rain! Nothing but rain--and no family here!\" as\\nhe goes in again and lies down with a gloomy yawn.\\n\\nSo with the dogs in the kennel-buildings across the park, who have\\ntheir restless fits and whose doleful voices when the wind has been\\nvery obstinate have even made it known in the house itself--upstairs,\\ndownstairs, and in my Lady\\'s chamber. They may hunt the whole\\ncountry-side, while the raindrops are pattering round their\\ninactivity. So the rabbits with their self-betraying tails, frisking\\nin and out of holes at roots of trees, may be lively with ideas of\\nthe breezy days when their ears are blown about or of those seasons\\nof interest when there are sweet young plants to gnaw. The turkey in\\nthe poultry-yard, always troubled with a class-grievance (probably\\nChristmas), may be reminiscent of that summer morning wrongfully\\ntaken from him when he got into the lane among the felled trees,\\nwhere there was a barn and barley. The discontented goose, who stoops\\nto pass under the old gateway, twenty feet high, may gabble out, if\\nwe only knew it, a waddling preference for weather when the gateway\\ncasts its shadow on the ground.\\n\\nBe this as it may, there is not much fancy otherwise stirring at\\nChesney Wold. If there be a little at any odd moment, it goes, like a\\nlittle noise in that old echoing place, a long way and usually leads\\noff to ghosts and mystery.\\n\\nIt has rained so hard and rained so long down in Lincolnshire that\\nMrs. Rouncewell, the old housekeeper at Chesney Wold, has several\\ntimes taken off her spectacles and cleaned them to make certain that\\nthe drops were not upon the glasses. Mrs. Rouncewell might have been\\nsufficiently assured by hearing the rain, but that she is rather\\ndeaf, which nothing will induce her to believe. She is a fine old\\nlady, handsome, stately, wonderfully neat, and has such a back and\\nsuch a stomacher that if her stays should turn out when she dies to\\nhave been a broad old-fashioned family fire-grate, nobody who knows\\nher would have cause to be surprised. Weather affects Mrs. Rouncewell\\nlittle. The house is there in all weathers, and the house, as she\\nexpresses it, \"is what she looks at.\" She sits in her room (in a side\\npassage on the ground floor, with an arched window commanding a\\nsmooth quadrangle, adorned at regular intervals with smooth round\\ntrees and smooth round blocks of stone, as if the trees were going to\\nplay at bowls with the stones), and the whole house reposes on her\\nmind. She can open it on occasion and be busy and fluttered, but it\\nis shut up now and lies on the breadth of Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s\\niron-bound bosom in a majestic sleep.\\n\\nIt is the next difficult thing to an impossibility to imagine Chesney\\nWold without Mrs. Rouncewell, but she has only been here fifty years.\\nAsk her how long, this rainy day, and she shall answer \"fifty year,\\nthree months, and a fortnight, by the blessing of heaven, if I live\\ntill Tuesday.\" Mr. Rouncewell died some time before the decease of\\nthe pretty fashion of pig-tails, and modestly hid his own (if he took\\nit with him) in a corner of the churchyard in the park near the\\nmouldy porch. He was born in the market-town, and so was his young\\nwidow. Her progress in the family began in the time of the last Sir\\nLeicester and originated in the still-room.\\n\\nThe present representative of the Dedlocks is an excellent master. He\\nsupposes all his dependents to be utterly bereft of individual\\ncharacters, intentions, or opinions, and is persuaded that he was\\nborn to supersede the necessity of their having any. If he were to\\nmake a discovery to the contrary, he would be simply stunned--would\\nnever recover himself, most likely, except to gasp and die. But he is\\nan excellent master still, holding it a part of his state to be so.\\nHe has a great liking for Mrs. Rouncewell; he says she is a most\\nrespectable, creditable woman. He always shakes hands with her when\\nhe comes down to Chesney Wold and when he goes away; and if he were\\nvery ill, or if he were knocked down by accident, or run over, or\\nplaced in any situation expressive of a Dedlock at a disadvantage, he\\nwould say if he could speak, \"Leave me, and send Mrs. Rouncewell\\nhere!\" feeling his dignity, at such a pass, safer with her than with\\nanybody else.\\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell has known trouble. She has had two sons, of whom the\\nyounger ran wild, and went for a soldier, and never came back. Even\\nto this hour, Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s calm hands lose their composure when\\nshe speaks of him, and unfolding themselves from her stomacher, hover\\nabout her in an agitated manner as she says what a likely lad, what a\\nfine lad, what a gay, good-humoured, clever lad he was! Her second\\nson would have been provided for at Chesney Wold and would have been\\nmade steward in due season, but he took, when he was a schoolboy, to\\nconstructing steam-engines out of saucepans and setting birds to draw\\ntheir own water with the least possible amount of labour, so\\nassisting them with artful contrivance of hydraulic pressure that a\\nthirsty canary had only, in a literal sense, to put his shoulder to\\nthe wheel and the job was done. This propensity gave Mrs. Rouncewell\\ngreat uneasiness. She felt it with a mother\\'s anguish to be a move in\\nthe Wat Tyler direction, well knowing that Sir Leicester had that\\ngeneral impression of an aptitude for any art to which smoke and a\\ntall chimney might be considered essential. But the doomed young\\nrebel (otherwise a mild youth, and very persevering), showing no sign\\nof grace as he got older but, on the contrary, constructing a model\\nof a power-loom, she was fain, with many tears, to mention his\\nbackslidings to the baronet. \"Mrs. Rouncewell,\" said Sir Leicester,\\n\"I can never consent to argue, as you know, with any one on any\\nsubject. You had better get rid of your boy; you had better get him\\ninto some Works. The iron country farther north is, I suppose, the\\ncongenial direction for a boy with these tendencies.\" Farther north\\nhe went, and farther north he grew up; and if Sir Leicester Dedlock\\never saw him when he came to Chesney Wold to visit his mother, or\\never thought of him afterwards, it is certain that he only regarded\\nhim as one of a body of some odd thousand conspirators, swarthy and\\ngrim, who were in the habit of turning out by torchlight two or three\\nnights in the week for unlawful purposes.\\n\\nNevertheless, Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s son has, in the course of nature and\\nart, grown up, and established himself, and married, and called unto\\nhim Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s grandson, who, being out of his apprenticeship,\\nand home from a journey in far countries, whither he was sent to\\nenlarge his knowledge and complete his preparations for the venture\\nof this life, stands leaning against the chimney-piece this very day\\nin Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s room at Chesney Wold.\\n\\n\"And, again and again, I am glad to see you, Watt! And, once again, I\\nam glad to see you, Watt!\" says Mrs. Rouncewell. \"You are a fine\\nyoung fellow. You are like your poor uncle George. Ah!\" Mrs.\\nRouncewell\\'s hands unquiet, as usual, on this reference.\\n\\n\"They say I am like my father, grandmother.\"\\n\\n\"Like him, also, my dear--but most like your poor uncle George! And\\nyour dear father.\" Mrs. Rouncewell folds her hands again. \"He is\\nwell?\"\\n\\n\"Thriving, grandmother, in every way.\"\\n\\n\"I am thankful!\" Mrs. Rouncewell is fond of her son but has a\\nplaintive feeling towards him, much as if he were a very honourable\\nsoldier who had gone over to the enemy.\\n\\n\"He is quite happy?\" says she.\\n\\n\"Quite.\"\\n\\n\"I am thankful! So he has brought you up to follow in his ways and\\nhas sent you into foreign countries and the like? Well, he knows\\nbest. There may be a world beyond Chesney Wold that I don\\'t\\nunderstand. Though I am not young, either. And I have seen a quantity\\nof good company too!\"\\n\\n\"Grandmother,\" says the young man, changing the subject, \"what a very\\npretty girl that was I found with you just now. You called her Rosa?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, child. She is daughter of a widow in the village. Maids are so\\nhard to teach, now-a-days, that I have put her about me young. She\\'s\\nan apt scholar and will do well. She shows the house already, very\\npretty. She lives with me at my table here.\"\\n\\n\"I hope I have not driven her away?\"\\n\\n\"She supposes we have family affairs to speak about, I dare say. She\\nis very modest. It is a fine quality in a young woman. And scarcer,\"\\nsays Mrs. Rouncewell, expanding her stomacher to its utmost limits,\\n\"than it formerly was!\"\\n\\nThe young man inclines his head in acknowledgment of the precepts of\\nexperience. Mrs. Rouncewell listens.\\n\\n\"Wheels!\" says she. They have long been audible to the younger ears\\nof her companion. \"What wheels on such a day as this, for gracious\\nsake?\"\\n\\nAfter a short interval, a tap at the door. \"Come in!\" A dark-eyed,\\ndark-haired, shy, village beauty comes in--so fresh in her rosy and\\nyet delicate bloom that the drops of rain which have beaten on her\\nhair look like the dew upon a flower fresh gathered.\\n\\n\"What company is this, Rosa?\" says Mrs. Rouncewell.\\n\\n\"It\\'s two young men in a gig, ma\\'am, who want to see the house--yes,\\nand if you please, I told them so!\" in quick reply to a gesture of\\ndissent from the housekeeper. \"I went to the hall-door and told them\\nit was the wrong day and the wrong hour, but the young man who was\\ndriving took off his hat in the wet and begged me to bring this card\\nto you.\"\\n\\n\"Read it, my dear Watt,\" says the housekeeper.\\n\\nRosa is so shy as she gives it to him that they drop it between them\\nand almost knock their foreheads together as they pick it up. Rosa is\\nshyer than before.\\n\\n\"Mr. Guppy\" is all the information the card yields.\\n\\n\"Guppy!\" repeats Mrs. Rouncewell, \"MR. Guppy! Nonsense, I never heard\\nof him!\"\\n\\n\"If you please, he told ME that!\" says Rosa. \"But he said that he and\\nthe other young gentleman came from London only last night by the\\nmail, on business at the magistrates\\' meeting, ten miles off, this\\nmorning, and that as their business was soon over, and they had heard\\na great deal said of Chesney Wold, and really didn\\'t know what to do\\nwith themselves, they had come through the wet to see it. They are\\nlawyers. He says he is not in Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s office, but he is\\nsure he may make use of Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s name if necessary.\"\\nFinding, now she leaves off, that she has been making quite a long\\nspeech, Rosa is shyer than ever.\\n\\nNow, Mr. Tulkinghorn is, in a manner, part and parcel of the place,\\nand besides, is supposed to have made Mrs. Rouncewell\\'s will. The old\\nlady relaxes, consents to the admission of the visitors as a favour,\\nand dismisses Rosa. The grandson, however, being smitten by a sudden\\nwish to see the house himself, proposes to join the party. The\\ngrandmother, who is pleased that he should have that interest,\\naccompanies him--though to do him justice, he is exceedingly\\nunwilling to trouble her.\\n\\n\"Much obliged to you, ma\\'am!\" says Mr. Guppy, divesting himself of\\nhis wet dreadnought in the hall. \"Us London lawyers don\\'t often get\\nan out, and when we do, we like to make the most of it, you know.\"\\n\\nThe old housekeeper, with a gracious severity of deportment, waves\\nher hand towards the great staircase. Mr. Guppy and his friend follow\\nRosa; Mrs. Rouncewell and her grandson follow them; a young gardener\\ngoes before to open the shutters.\\n\\nAs is usually the case with people who go over houses, Mr. Guppy and\\nhis friend are dead beat before they have well begun. They straggle\\nabout in wrong places, look at wrong things, don\\'t care for the right\\nthings, gape when more rooms are opened, exhibit profound depression\\nof spirits, and are clearly knocked up. In each successive chamber\\nthat they enter, Mrs. Rouncewell, who is as upright as the house\\nitself, rests apart in a window-seat or other such nook and listens\\nwith stately approval to Rosa\\'s exposition. Her grandson is so\\nattentive to it that Rosa is shyer than ever--and prettier. Thus they\\npass on from room to room, raising the pictured Dedlocks for a few\\nbrief minutes as the young gardener admits the light, and\\nreconsigning them to their graves as he shuts it out again. It\\nappears to the afflicted Mr. Guppy and his inconsolable friend that\\nthere is no end to the Dedlocks, whose family greatness seems to\\nconsist in their never having done anything to distinguish themselves\\nfor seven hundred years.\\n\\nEven the long drawing-room of Chesney Wold cannot revive Mr. Guppy\\'s\\nspirits. He is so low that he droops on the threshold and has hardly\\nstrength of mind to enter. But a portrait over the chimney-piece,\\npainted by the fashionable artist of the day, acts upon him like a\\ncharm. He recovers in a moment. He stares at it with uncommon\\ninterest; he seems to be fixed and fascinated by it.\\n\\n\"Dear me!\" says Mr. Guppy. \"Who\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\"The picture over the fire-place,\" says Rosa, \"is the portrait of the\\npresent Lady Dedlock. It is considered a perfect likeness, and the\\nbest work of the master.\"\\n\\n\"Blest,\" says Mr. Guppy, staring in a kind of dismay at his friend,\\n\"if I can ever have seen her. Yet I know her! Has the picture been\\nengraved, miss?\"\\n\\n\"The picture has never been engraved. Sir Leicester has always\\nrefused permission.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" says Mr. Guppy in a low voice. \"I\\'ll be shot if it ain\\'t very\\ncurious how well I know that picture! So that\\'s Lady Dedlock, is it!\"\\n\\n\"The picture on the right is the present Sir Leicester Dedlock. The\\npicture on the left is his father, the late Sir Leicester.\"\\n\\nMr. Guppy has no eyes for either of these magnates. \"It\\'s\\nunaccountable to me,\" he says, still staring at the portrait, \"how\\nwell I know that picture! I\\'m dashed,\" adds Mr. Guppy, looking round,\\n\"if I don\\'t think I must have had a dream of that picture, you know!\"\\n\\nAs no one present takes any especial interest in Mr. Guppy\\'s dreams,\\nthe probability is not pursued. But he still remains so absorbed by\\nthe portrait that he stands immovable before it until the young\\ngardener has closed the shutters, when he comes out of the room in a\\ndazed state that is an odd though a sufficient substitute for\\ninterest and follows into the succeeding rooms with a confused stare,\\nas if he were looking everywhere for Lady Dedlock again.\\n\\nHe sees no more of her. He sees her rooms, which are the last shown,\\nas being very elegant, and he looks out of the windows from which she\\nlooked out, not long ago, upon the weather that bored her to death.\\nAll things have an end, even houses that people take infinite pains\\nto see and are tired of before they begin to see them. He has come to\\nthe end of the sight, and the fresh village beauty to the end of her\\ndescription; which is always this: \"The terrace below is much\\nadmired. It is called, from an old story in the family, the Ghost\\'s\\nWalk.\"\\n\\n\"No?\" says Mr. Guppy, greedily curious. \"What\\'s the story, miss? Is\\nit anything about a picture?\"\\n\\n\"Pray tell us the story,\" says Watt in a half whisper.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know it, sir.\" Rosa is shyer than ever.\\n\\n\"It is not related to visitors; it is almost forgotten,\" says the\\nhousekeeper, advancing. \"It has never been more than a family\\nanecdote.\"\\n\\n\"You\\'ll excuse my asking again if it has anything to do with a\\npicture, ma\\'am,\" observes Mr. Guppy, \"because I do assure you that\\nthe more I think of that picture the better I know it, without\\nknowing how I know it!\"\\n\\nThe story has nothing to do with a picture; the housekeeper can\\nguarantee that. Mr. Guppy is obliged to her for the information and\\nis, moreover, generally obliged. He retires with his friend, guided\\ndown another staircase by the young gardener, and presently is heard\\nto drive away. It is now dusk. Mrs. Rouncewell can trust to the\\ndiscretion of her two young hearers and may tell THEM how the terrace\\ncame to have that ghostly name.\\n\\nShe seats herself in a large chair by the fast-darkening window and\\ntells them: \"In the wicked days, my dears, of King Charles the\\nFirst--I mean, of course, in the wicked days of the rebels who\\nleagued themselves against that excellent king--Sir Morbury Dedlock\\nwas the owner of Chesney Wold. Whether there was any account of a\\nghost in the family before those days, I can\\'t say. I should think it\\nvery likely indeed.\"\\n\\nMrs. Rouncewell holds this opinion because she considers that a\\nfamily of such antiquity and importance has a right to a ghost. She\\nregards a ghost as one of the privileges of the upper classes, a\\ngenteel distinction to which the common people have no claim.\\n\\n\"Sir Morbury Dedlock,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell, \"was, I have no occasion\\nto say, on the side of the blessed martyr. But it IS supposed that\\nhis Lady, who had none of the family blood in her veins, favoured the\\nbad cause. It is said that she had relations among King Charles\\'s\\nenemies, that she was in correspondence with them, and that she gave\\nthem information. When any of the country gentlemen who followed his\\nMajesty\\'s cause met here, it is said that my Lady was always nearer\\nto the door of their council-room than they supposed. Do you hear a\\nsound like a footstep passing along the terrace, Watt?\"\\n\\nRosa draws nearer to the housekeeper.\\n\\n\"I hear the rain-drip on the stones,\" replies the young man, \"and I\\nhear a curious echo--I suppose an echo--which is very like a halting\\nstep.\"\\n\\nThe housekeeper gravely nods and continues: \"Partly on account of\\nthis division between them, and partly on other accounts, Sir Morbury\\nand his Lady led a troubled life. She was a lady of a haughty temper.\\nThey were not well suited to each other in age or character, and they\\nhad no children to moderate between them. After her favourite\\nbrother, a young gentleman, was killed in the civil wars (by Sir\\nMorbury\\'s near kinsman), her feeling was so violent that she hated\\nthe race into which she had married. When the Dedlocks were about to\\nride out from Chesney Wold in the king\\'s cause, she is supposed to\\nhave more than once stolen down into the stables in the dead of night\\nand lamed their horses; and the story is that once at such an hour,\\nher husband saw her gliding down the stairs and followed her into the\\nstall where his own favourite horse stood. There he seized her by the\\nwrist, and in a struggle or in a fall or through the horse being\\nfrightened and lashing out, she was lamed in the hip and from that\\nhour began to pine away.\"\\n\\nThe housekeeper has dropped her voice to a little more than a\\nwhisper.\\n\\n\"She had been a lady of a handsome figure and a noble carriage. She\\nnever complained of the change; she never spoke to any one of being\\ncrippled or of being in pain, but day by day she tried to walk upon\\nthe terrace, and with the help of the stone balustrade, went up and\\ndown, up and down, up and down, in sun and shadow, with greater\\ndifficulty every day. At last, one afternoon her husband (to whom she\\nhad never, on any persuasion, opened her lips since that night),\\nstanding at the great south window, saw her drop upon the pavement.\\nHe hastened down to raise her, but she repulsed him as he bent over\\nher, and looking at him fixedly and coldly, said, \\'I will die here\\nwhere I have walked. And I will walk here, though I am in my grave. I\\nwill walk here until the pride of this house is humbled. And when\\ncalamity or when disgrace is coming to it, let the Dedlocks listen\\nfor my step!\\'\"\\n\\nWatt looks at Rosa. Rosa in the deepening gloom looks down upon the\\nground, half frightened and half shy.\\n\\n\"There and then she died. And from those days,\" says Mrs. Rouncewell,\\n\"the name has come down--the Ghost\\'s Walk. If the tread is an echo,\\nit is an echo that is only heard after dark, and is often unheard for\\na long while together. But it comes back from time to time; and so\\nsure as there is sickness or death in the family, it will be heard\\nthen.\"\\n\\n\"And disgrace, grandmother--\" says Watt.\\n\\n\"Disgrace never comes to Chesney Wold,\" returns the housekeeper.\\n\\nHer grandson apologizes with \"True. True.\"\\n\\n\"That is the story. Whatever the sound is, it is a worrying sound,\"\\nsays Mrs. Rouncewell, getting up from her chair; \"and what is to be\\nnoticed in it is that it MUST BE HEARD. My Lady, who is afraid of\\nnothing, admits that when it is there, it must be heard. You cannot\\nshut it out. Watt, there is a tall French clock behind you (placed\\nthere, \\'a purpose) that has a loud beat when it is in motion and can\\nplay music. You understand how those things are managed?\"\\n\\n\"Pretty well, grandmother, I think.\"\\n\\n\"Set it a-going.\"\\n\\nWatt sets it a-going--music and all.\\n\\n\"Now, come hither,\" says the housekeeper. \"Hither, child, towards my\\nLady\\'s pillow. I am not sure that it is dark enough yet, but listen!\\nCan you hear the sound upon the terrace, through the music, and the\\nbeat, and everything?\"\\n\\n\"I certainly can!\"\\n\\n\"So my Lady says.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'model_output': \"The story takes place primarily at two estates - Bleak House, owned by Mr. Jarndyce, and Chesney Wold. The narrator is Esther Summerson, who visits Bleak House along with Ada and Richard. Mr. Jarndyce is their guardian. Another resident at Bleak House is Mr. Skimpole, who is carefree and irresponsible. Esther and Ada also meet Miss Jellyby, who has a chaotic family. \\nAt Bleak House, Esther and Ada visit Krook, a rag and bottle merchant. They meet one of his lodgers who is a law-writer. Later, Esther and Ada visit Chesney Wold, where it is constantly raining. Mrs. Rouncewell is the housekeeper there. Her grandson Watt visits her at Chesney Wold. Mr. Guppy and his friend also come to Chesney Wold. There is a portrait of Lady Dedlock at Chesney Wold. Mrs. Rouncewell tells the story of the Ghost's Walk at the estate.\\nIn summary, the chapters cover Esther and Ada's visits to Bleak House and interactions with its residents, as well as their later trip to Chesney Wold, where they learn more about the estate and its history. Key characters, places and events are introduced.\"}, {'summary': 'Esther and Mr. Jarndyce discuss the Chancery suit, and Esther leans that it is a hopeless muddle, and anything left of the great fortune disputed within it has been consumed by legal costs. The story of Tom Jarndyce is related again; we learn that Bleak House, once called Peaks, took its name during Tom Jarndyce\\'s lifetime because he allowed it to go to rack and ruin. The street of houses in London, which we will learn later is called Tom-all-Alone\\'s, is part of the suit also. Esther learns that Mr. Jarndyce, who begs her to call him Guardian, has a little room he retreats to when he is out of sorts called \"The Growlery.\"\\n\\nMrs. Pardiggle and her five miserable sons arrive for a visit. Mrs. Pardiggle is a country version of Mrs. Jellyby, another obsessive and misguided philanthropist who neglects her children in favor of a fashionable charity. She takes the young people to a brickmaker\\'s hovel in the village, and there Ada and Esther witness not only the lives of poverty and filth and despair that the people there live, but also the death of the brickmaker\\'s baby in his mother\\'s (Jenny) lap. The girls are much moved, and Esther significantly covers the tiny corpse with her handkerchief. The young ladies are moved by the downtrodden, beaten brickmakers\\' wives (Jenny and Liz) comforting each other, and it is contrasted with their bluster and ineffectual do-gooding. They come back later to comfort Jenny.\\n\\nIn Chapter 9 Richard is unsure what to do with his life. Esther and Jarndyce had discussed what he should do for a profession, and the two agree that to ask him what he would like to do would be best. But Richard cannot decide, and it becomes apparent that the spectre of the Chancery suit, though he claims to ignore it, holds a psychic hold on him.\\n\\nMr. Boythorn has written Mr. Jandyce a letter, and he is coming for a visit. He arrives and proves to be a boisterous and agreeable companion. We learn that he was once to have been married, but his fiance \"died to him.\" The dispute over the right-of-way between Sir Leicester Dedlock and Boythorn, who are neighbors, is introduced, and Boythorn is voluble in his criticism of the baronet. However, Boythorn is fond of Lady Dedlock.\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce writes to Sir Leicester Dedlock, who is a distant relative of Richard, to ask with help placing Richard in the world. He receives no likely help from that quarter.\\n\\nIt becomes obvious to Esther that Ada and Richard have fallen in love. Mr. Guppy arrives at Bleak House on an errand for Kenge and Carboy\\'s. He proposes marriage to Esther, who firmly rejects him.\\n\\nIn Chapter 10 Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby and their law-stationery shop in London are described. Mrs. Snagsby is an awful termagent, and Mr. Snagsby is timid and cowed. They have a maid, Guster, who is prone to fits. It is a pathetic description, for Mr. Snagsby appears to be a decent man.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn\\'s London lodgings are described, where \"lawyers lie like maggots in nuts\". Mr. Tulkinghorn goes to Snagsby\\'s shop to find out who copied out the paper of Jarndyce and Jarndyce in which Lady Dedlock took such an interest. The Coavinses sherrif\\'s officers (bailiff\\'s -- repossesion agents) offices, the firm in which Neckett the debt-collector for Skimpole employed, are nearby.\\n\\nMr. Snagsby informs Mr. Tulkinghorn that a man called Nemo (the Latin for \"no one\"), who lives above Krook\\'s shop, is the copyist. Mr. Snagsby brings Mr. Tulkinghorn to Krook\\'s shop, and Mr. Tulkinghorn goes up to Nemo\\'s room, where he finds him lying on the bed with the scent of opium in the shabby room.', 'text': 'It was interesting when I dressed before daylight to peep out of\\nwindow, where my candles were reflected in the black panes like\\ntwo beacons, and finding all beyond still enshrouded in the\\nindistinctness of last night, to watch how it turned out when the day\\ncame on. As the prospect gradually revealed itself and disclosed the\\nscene over which the wind had wandered in the dark, like my memory\\nover my life, I had a pleasure in discovering the unknown objects\\nthat had been around me in my sleep. At first they were faintly\\ndiscernible in the mist, and above them the later stars still\\nglimmered. That pale interval over, the picture began to enlarge and\\nfill up so fast that at every new peep I could have found enough\\nto look at for an hour. Imperceptibly my candles became the only\\nincongruous part of the morning, the dark places in my room all\\nmelted away, and the day shone bright upon a cheerful landscape,\\nprominent in which the old Abbey Church, with its massive tower,\\nthrew a softer train of shadow on the view than seemed compatible\\nwith its rugged character. But so from rough outsides (I hope I have\\nlearnt), serene and gentle influences often proceed.\\n\\nEvery part of the house was in such order, and every one was so\\nattentive to me, that I had no trouble with my two bunches of keys,\\nthough what with trying to remember the contents of each little\\nstore-room drawer and cupboard; and what with making notes on a slate\\nabout jams, and pickles, and preserves, and bottles, and glass, and\\nchina, and a great many other things; and what with being generally a\\nmethodical, old-maidish sort of foolish little person, I was so busy\\nthat I could not believe it was breakfast-time when I heard the bell\\nring. Away I ran, however, and made tea, as I had already been\\ninstalled into the responsibility of the tea-pot; and then, as they\\nwere all rather late and nobody was down yet, I thought I would take\\na peep at the garden and get some knowledge of that too. I found it\\nquite a delightful place--in front, the pretty avenue and drive by\\nwhich we had approached (and where, by the by, we had cut up the\\ngravel so terribly with our wheels that I asked the gardener to roll\\nit); at the back, the flower-garden, with my darling at her window up\\nthere, throwing it open to smile out at me, as if she would have\\nkissed me from that distance. Beyond the flower-garden was a\\nkitchen-garden, and then a paddock, and then a snug little rick-yard,\\nand then a dear little farm-yard. As to the house itself, with its\\nthree peaks in the roof; its various-shaped windows, some so large,\\nsome so small, and all so pretty; its trellis-work, against the\\nsouth-front for roses and honey-suckle, and its homely, comfortable,\\nwelcoming look--it was, as Ada said when she came out to meet me with\\nher arm through that of its master, worthy of her cousin John, a bold\\nthing to say, though he only pinched her dear cheek for it.\\n\\nMr. Skimpole was as agreeable at breakfast as he had been overnight.\\nThere was honey on the table, and it led him into a discourse about\\nbees. He had no objection to honey, he said (and I should think he\\nhad not, for he seemed to like it), but he protested against the\\noverweening assumptions of bees. He didn\\'t at all see why the busy\\nbee should be proposed as a model to him; he supposed the bee liked\\nto make honey, or he wouldn\\'t do it--nobody asked him. It was not\\nnecessary for the bee to make such a merit of his tastes. If every\\nconfectioner went buzzing about the world banging against everything\\nthat came in his way and egotistically calling upon everybody to take\\nnotice that he was going to his work and must not be interrupted, the\\nworld would be quite an unsupportable place. Then, after all, it was\\na ridiculous position to be smoked out of your fortune with brimstone\\nas soon as you had made it. You would have a very mean opinion of a\\nManchester man if he spun cotton for no other purpose. He must say he\\nthought a drone the embodiment of a pleasanter and wiser idea. The\\ndrone said unaffectedly, \"You will excuse me; I really cannot attend\\nto the shop! I find myself in a world in which there is so much to\\nsee and so short a time to see it in that I must take the liberty of\\nlooking about me and begging to be provided for by somebody who\\ndoesn\\'t want to look about him.\" This appeared to Mr. Skimpole to be\\nthe drone philosophy, and he thought it a very good philosophy,\\nalways supposing the drone to be willing to be on good terms with the\\nbee, which, so far as he knew, the easy fellow always was, if the\\nconsequential creature would only let him, and not be so conceited\\nabout his honey!\\n\\nHe pursued this fancy with the lightest foot over a variety of ground\\nand made us all merry, though again he seemed to have as serious a\\nmeaning in what he said as he was capable of having. I left them\\nstill listening to him when I withdrew to attend to my new duties.\\nThey had occupied me for some time, and I was passing through the\\npassages on my return with my basket of keys on my arm when Mr.\\nJarndyce called me into a small room next his bed-chamber, which I\\nfound to be in part a little library of books and papers and in part\\nquite a little museum of his boots and shoes and hat-boxes.\\n\\n\"Sit down, my dear,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"This, you must know, is the\\ngrowlery. When I am out of humour, I come and growl here.\"\\n\\n\"You must be here very seldom, sir,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Oh, you don\\'t know me!\" he returned. \"When I am deceived or\\ndisappointed in--the wind, and it\\'s easterly, I take refuge here. The\\ngrowlery is the best-used room in the house. You are not aware of\\nhalf my humours yet. My dear, how you are trembling!\"\\n\\nI could not help it; I tried very hard, but being alone with that\\nbenevolent presence, and meeting his kind eyes, and feeling so happy\\nand so honoured there, and my heart so full--I kissed his hand. I\\ndon\\'t know what I said, or even that I spoke. He was disconcerted and\\nwalked to the window; I almost believed with an intention of jumping\\nout, until he turned and I was reassured by seeing in his eyes what\\nhe had gone there to hide. He gently patted me on the head, and I sat\\ndown.\\n\\n\"There! There!\" he said. \"That\\'s over. Pooh! Don\\'t be foolish.\"\\n\\n\"It shall not happen again, sir,\" I returned, \"but at first it is\\ndifficult--\"\\n\\n\"Nonsense!\" he said. \"It\\'s easy, easy. Why not? I hear of a good\\nlittle orphan girl without a protector, and I take it into my head to\\nbe that protector. She grows up, and more than justifies my good\\nopinion, and I remain her guardian and her friend. What is there in\\nall this? So, so! Now, we have cleared off old scores, and I have\\nbefore me thy pleasant, trusting, trusty face again.\"\\n\\nI said to myself, \"Esther, my dear, you surprise me! This really is\\nnot what I expected of you!\" And it had such a good effect that I\\nfolded my hands upon my basket and quite recovered myself. Mr.\\nJarndyce, expressing his approval in his face, began to talk to me as\\nconfidentially as if I had been in the habit of conversing with him\\nevery morning for I don\\'t know how long. I almost felt as if I had.\\n\\n\"Of course, Esther,\" he said, \"you don\\'t understand this Chancery\\nbusiness?\"\\n\\nAnd of course I shook my head.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know who does,\" he returned. \"The lawyers have twisted it\\ninto such a state of bedevilment that the original merits of the case\\nhave long disappeared from the face of the earth. It\\'s about a will\\nand the trusts under a will--or it was once. It\\'s about nothing but\\ncosts now. We are always appearing, and disappearing, and swearing,\\nand interrogating, and filing, and cross-filing, and arguing, and\\nsealing, and motioning, and referring, and reporting, and revolving\\nabout the Lord Chancellor and all his satellites, and equitably\\nwaltzing ourselves off to dusty death, about costs. That\\'s the great\\nquestion. All the rest, by some extraordinary means, has melted\\naway.\"\\n\\n\"But it was, sir,\" said I, to bring him back, for he began to rub his\\nhead, \"about a will?\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes, it was about a will when it was about anything,\" he\\nreturned. \"A certain Jarndyce, in an evil hour, made a great fortune,\\nand made a great will. In the question how the trusts under that will\\nare to be administered, the fortune left by the will is squandered\\naway; the legatees under the will are reduced to such a miserable\\ncondition that they would be sufficiently punished if they had\\ncommitted an enormous crime in having money left them, and the will\\nitself is made a dead letter. All through the deplorable cause,\\neverything that everybody in it, except one man, knows already is\\nreferred to that only one man who don\\'t know, it to find out--all\\nthrough the deplorable cause, everybody must have copies, over and\\nover again, of everything that has accumulated about it in the way of\\ncartloads of papers (or must pay for them without having them, which\\nis the usual course, for nobody wants them) and must go down the\\nmiddle and up again through such an infernal country-dance of costs\\nand fees and nonsense and corruption as was never dreamed of in the\\nwildest visions of a witch\\'s Sabbath. Equity sends questions to law,\\nlaw sends questions back to equity; law finds it can\\'t do this,\\nequity finds it can\\'t do that; neither can so much as say it can\\'t\\ndo anything, without this solicitor instructing and this counsel\\nappearing for A, and that solicitor instructing and that counsel\\nappearing for B; and so on through the whole alphabet, like the\\nhistory of the apple pie. And thus, through years and years, and\\nlives and lives, everything goes on, constantly beginning over and\\nover again, and nothing ever ends. And we can\\'t get out of the suit\\non any terms, for we are made parties to it, and MUST BE parties to\\nit, whether we like it or not. But it won\\'t do to think of it! When\\nmy great uncle, poor Tom Jarndyce, began to think of it, it was the\\nbeginning of the end!\"\\n\\n\"The Mr. Jarndyce, sir, whose story I have heard?\"\\n\\nHe nodded gravely. \"I was his heir, and this was his house, Esther.\\nWhen I came here, it was bleak indeed. He had left the signs of his\\nmisery upon it.\"\\n\\n\"How changed it must be now!\" I said.\\n\\n\"It had been called, before his time, the Peaks. He gave it its\\npresent name and lived here shut up, day and night poring over the\\nwicked heaps of papers in the suit and hoping against hope to\\ndisentangle it from its mystification and bring it to a close. In the\\nmeantime, the place became dilapidated, the wind whistled through the\\ncracked walls, the rain fell through the broken roof, the weeds\\nchoked the passage to the rotting door. When I brought what remained\\nof him home here, the brains seemed to me to have been blown out of\\nthe house too, it was so shattered and ruined.\"\\n\\nHe walked a little to and fro after saying this to himself with a\\nshudder, and then looked at me, and brightened, and came and sat down\\nagain with his hands in his pockets.\\n\\n\"I told you this was the growlery, my dear. Where was I?\"\\n\\nI reminded him, at the hopeful change he had made in Bleak House.\\n\\n\"Bleak House; true. There is, in that city of London there, some\\nproperty of ours which is much at this day what Bleak House was then;\\nI say property of ours, meaning of the suit\\'s, but I ought to call it\\nthe property of costs, for costs is the only power on earth that will\\never get anything out of it now or will ever know it for anything but\\nan eyesore and a heartsore. It is a street of perishing blind houses,\\nwith their eyes stoned out, without a pane of glass, without so much\\nas a window-frame, with the bare blank shutters tumbling from their\\nhinges and falling asunder, the iron rails peeling away in flakes of\\nrust, the chimneys sinking in, the stone steps to every door (and\\nevery door might be death\\'s door) turning stagnant green, the very\\ncrutches on which the ruins are propped decaying. Although Bleak\\nHouse was not in Chancery, its master was, and it was stamped with\\nthe same seal. These are the Great Seal\\'s impressions, my dear, all\\nover England--the children know them!\"\\n\\n\"How changed it is!\" I said again.\\n\\n\"Why, so it is,\" he answered much more cheerfully; \"and it is wisdom\\nin you to keep me to the bright side of the picture.\" (The idea of my\\nwisdom!) \"These are things I never talk about or even think about,\\nexcepting in the growlery here. If you consider it right to mention\\nthem to Rick and Ada,\" looking seriously at me, \"you can. I leave it\\nto your discretion, Esther.\"\\n\\n\"I hope, sir--\" said I.\\n\\n\"I think you had better call me guardian, my dear.\"\\n\\nI felt that I was choking again--I taxed myself with it, \"Esther,\\nnow, you know you are!\"--when he feigned to say this slightly, as if\\nit were a whim instead of a thoughtful tenderness. But I gave the\\nhousekeeping keys the least shake in the world as a reminder to\\nmyself, and folding my hands in a still more determined manner on the\\nbasket, looked at him quietly.\\n\\n\"I hope, guardian,\" said I, \"that you may not trust too much to my\\ndiscretion. I hope you may not mistake me. I am afraid it will be a\\ndisappointment to you to know that I am not clever, but it really is\\nthe truth, and you would soon find it out if I had not the honesty to\\nconfess it.\"\\n\\nHe did not seem at all disappointed; quite the contrary. He told me,\\nwith a smile all over his face, that he knew me very well indeed and\\nthat I was quite clever enough for him.\\n\\n\"I hope I may turn out so,\" said I, \"but I am much afraid of it,\\nguardian.\"\\n\\n\"You are clever enough to be the good little woman of our lives here,\\nmy dear,\" he returned playfully; \"the little old woman of the child\\'s\\n(I don\\'t mean Skimpole\\'s) rhyme:\\n\\n\\n   \"\\'Little old woman, and whither so high?\\'\\n    \\'To sweep the cobwebs out of the sky.\\'\\n\\n\\n\"You will sweep them so neatly out of OUR sky in the course of your\\nhousekeeping, Esther, that one of these days we shall have to abandon\\nthe growlery and nail up the door.\"\\n\\nThis was the beginning of my being called Old Woman, and Little Old\\nWoman, and Cobweb, and Mrs. Shipton, and Mother Hubbard, and Dame\\nDurden, and so many names of that sort that my own name soon became\\nquite lost among them.\\n\\n\"However,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, \"to return to our gossip. Here\\'s Rick,\\na fine young fellow full of promise. What\\'s to be done with him?\"\\n\\nOh, my goodness, the idea of asking my advice on such a point!\\n\\n\"Here he is, Esther,\" said Mr. Jarndyce, comfortably putting his\\nhands into his pockets and stretching out his legs. \"He must have a\\nprofession; he must make some choice for himself. There will be a\\nworld more wiglomeration about it, I suppose, but it must be done.\"\\n\\n\"More what, guardian?\" said I.\\n\\n\"More wiglomeration,\" said he. \"It\\'s the only name I know for the\\nthing. He is a ward in Chancery, my dear. Kenge and Carboy will have\\nsomething to say about it; Master Somebody--a sort of ridiculous\\nsexton, digging graves for the merits of causes in a back room at the\\nend of Quality Court, Chancery Lane--will have something to say about\\nit; counsel will have something to say about it; the Chancellor will\\nhave something to say about it; the satellites will have something to\\nsay about it; they will all have to be handsomely feed, all round,\\nabout it; the whole thing will be vastly ceremonious, wordy,\\nunsatisfactory, and expensive, and I call it, in general,\\nwiglomeration. How mankind ever came to be afflicted with\\nwiglomeration, or for whose sins these young people ever fell into a\\npit of it, I don\\'t know; so it is.\"\\n\\nHe began to rub his head again and to hint that he felt the wind. But\\nit was a delightful instance of his kindness towards me that whether\\nhe rubbed his head, or walked about, or did both, his face was sure\\nto recover its benignant expression as it looked at mine; and he was\\nsure to turn comfortable again and put his hands in his pockets and\\nstretch out his legs.\\n\\n\"Perhaps it would be best, first of all,\" said I, \"to ask Mr. Richard\\nwhat he inclines to himself.\"\\n\\n\"Exactly so,\" he returned. \"That\\'s what I mean! You know, just\\naccustom yourself to talk it over, with your tact and in your quiet\\nway, with him and Ada, and see what you all make of it. We are sure\\nto come at the heart of the matter by your means, little woman.\"\\n\\nI really was frightened at the thought of the importance I was\\nattaining and the number of things that were being confided to me. I\\nhad not meant this at all; I had meant that he should speak to\\nRichard. But of course I said nothing in reply except that I would do\\nmy best, though I feared (I really felt it necessary to repeat this)\\nthat he thought me much more sagacious than I was. At which my\\nguardian only laughed the pleasantest laugh I ever heard.\\n\\n\"Come!\" he said, rising and pushing back his chair. \"I think we may\\nhave done with the growlery for one day! Only a concluding word.\\nEsther, my dear, do you wish to ask me anything?\"\\n\\nHe looked so attentively at me that I looked attentively at him and\\nfelt sure I understood him.\\n\\n\"About myself, sir?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"Guardian,\" said I, venturing to put my hand, which was suddenly\\ncolder than I could have wished, in his, \"nothing! I am quite sure\\nthat if there were anything I ought to know or had any need to know,\\nI should not have to ask you to tell it to me. If my whole reliance\\nand confidence were not placed in you, I must have a hard heart\\nindeed. I have nothing to ask you, nothing in the world.\"\\n\\nHe drew my hand through his arm and we went away to look for Ada.\\nFrom that hour I felt quite easy with him, quite unreserved, quite\\ncontent to know no more, quite happy.\\n\\nWe lived, at first, rather a busy life at Bleak House, for we had to\\nbecome acquainted with many residents in and out of the neighbourhood\\nwho knew Mr. Jarndyce. It seemed to Ada and me that everybody knew\\nhim who wanted to do anything with anybody else\\'s money. It amazed us\\nwhen we began to sort his letters and to answer some of them for him\\nin the growlery of a morning to find how the great object of the\\nlives of nearly all his correspondents appeared to be to form\\nthemselves into committees for getting in and laying out money. The\\nladies were as desperate as the gentlemen; indeed, I think they were\\neven more so. They threw themselves into committees in the most\\nimpassioned manner and collected subscriptions with a vehemence quite\\nextraordinary. It appeared to us that some of them must pass their\\nwhole lives in dealing out subscription-cards to the whole\\npost-office directory--shilling cards, half-crown cards,\\nhalf-sovereign cards, penny cards. They wanted everything. They\\nwanted wearing apparel, they wanted linen rags, they wanted money,\\nthey wanted coals, they wanted soup, they wanted interest, they\\nwanted autographs, they wanted flannel, they wanted whatever Mr.\\nJarndyce had--or had not. Their objects were as various as their\\ndemands. They were going to raise new buildings, they were going to\\npay off debts on old buildings, they were going to establish in a\\npicturesque building (engraving of proposed west elevation attached)\\nthe Sisterhood of Mediaeval Marys, they were going to give a\\ntestimonial to Mrs. Jellyby, they were going to have their\\nsecretary\\'s portrait painted and presented to his mother-in-law,\\nwhose deep devotion to him was well known, they were going to get up\\neverything, I really believe, from five hundred thousand tracts to an\\nannuity and from a marble monument to a silver tea-pot. They took a\\nmultitude of titles. They were the Women of England, the Daughters of\\nBritain, the Sisters of all the cardinal virtues separately, the\\nFemales of America, the Ladies of a hundred denominations. They\\nappeared to be always excited about canvassing and electing. They\\nseemed to our poor wits, and according to their own accounts, to be\\nconstantly polling people by tens of thousands, yet never bringing\\ntheir candidates in for anything. It made our heads ache to think, on\\nthe whole, what feverish lives they must lead.\\n\\nAmong the ladies who were most distinguished for this rapacious\\nbenevolence (if I may use the expression) was a Mrs. Pardiggle, who\\nseemed, as I judged from the number of her letters to Mr. Jarndyce,\\nto be almost as powerful a correspondent as Mrs. Jellyby herself. We\\nobserved that the wind always changed when Mrs. Pardiggle became the\\nsubject of conversation and that it invariably interrupted Mr.\\nJarndyce and prevented his going any farther, when he had remarked\\nthat there were two classes of charitable people; one, the people who\\ndid a little and made a great deal of noise; the other, the people\\nwho did a great deal and made no noise at all. We were therefore\\ncurious to see Mrs. Pardiggle, suspecting her to be a type of the\\nformer class, and were glad when she called one day with her five\\nyoung sons.\\n\\nShe was a formidable style of lady with spectacles, a prominent nose,\\nand a loud voice, who had the effect of wanting a great deal of room.\\nAnd she really did, for she knocked down little chairs with her\\nskirts that were quite a great way off. As only Ada and I were at\\nhome, we received her timidly, for she seemed to come in like cold\\nweather and to make the little Pardiggles blue as they followed.\\n\\n\"These, young ladies,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle with great volubility\\nafter the first salutations, \"are my five boys. You may have seen\\ntheir names in a printed subscription list (perhaps more than one) in\\nthe possession of our esteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce. Egbert, my eldest\\n(twelve), is the boy who sent out his pocket-money, to the amount of\\nfive and threepence, to the Tockahoopo Indians. Oswald, my second\\n(ten and a half), is the child who contributed two and nine-pence to\\nthe Great National Smithers Testimonial. Francis, my third (nine),\\none and sixpence halfpenny; Felix, my fourth (seven), eightpence to\\nthe Superannuated Widows; Alfred, my youngest (five), has voluntarily\\nenrolled himself in the Infant Bonds of Joy, and is pledged never,\\nthrough life, to use tobacco in any form.\"\\n\\nWe had never seen such dissatisfied children. It was not merely that\\nthey were weazened and shrivelled--though they were certainly that\\ntoo--but they looked absolutely ferocious with discontent. At the\\nmention of the Tockahoopo Indians, I could really have supposed\\nEgbert to be one of the most baleful members of that tribe, he gave\\nme such a savage frown. The face of each child, as the amount of his\\ncontribution was mentioned, darkened in a peculiarly vindictive\\nmanner, but his was by far the worst. I must except, however, the\\nlittle recruit into the Infant Bonds of Joy, who was stolidly and\\nevenly miserable.\\n\\n\"You have been visiting, I understand,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"at Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s?\"\\n\\nWe said yes, we had passed one night there.\\n\\n\"Mrs. Jellyby,\" pursued the lady, always speaking in the same\\ndemonstrative, loud, hard tone, so that her voice impressed my fancy\\nas if it had a sort of spectacles on too--and I may take the\\nopportunity of remarking that her spectacles were made the less\\nengaging by her eyes being what Ada called \"choking eyes,\" meaning\\nvery prominent--\"Mrs. Jellyby is a benefactor to society and deserves\\na helping hand. My boys have contributed to the African\\nproject--Egbert, one and six, being the entire allowance of nine\\nweeks; Oswald, one and a penny halfpenny, being the same; the rest,\\naccording to their little means. Nevertheless, I do not go with Mrs.\\nJellyby in all things. I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in her treatment\\nof her young family. It has been noticed. It has been observed that\\nher young family are excluded from participation in the objects to\\nwhich she is devoted. She may be right, she may be wrong; but, right\\nor wrong, this is not my course with MY young family. I take them\\neverywhere.\"\\n\\nI was afterwards convinced (and so was Ada) that from the\\nill-conditioned eldest child, these words extorted a sharp yell. He\\nturned it off into a yawn, but it began as a yell.\\n\\n\"They attend matins with me (very prettily done) at half-past six\\no\\'clock in the morning all the year round, including of course the\\ndepth of winter,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle rapidly, \"and they are with me\\nduring the revolving duties of the day. I am a School lady, I am a\\nVisiting lady, I am a Reading lady, I am a Distributing lady; I am on\\nthe local Linen Box Committee and many general committees; and my\\ncanvassing alone is very extensive--perhaps no one\\'s more so. But\\nthey are my companions everywhere; and by these means they acquire\\nthat knowledge of the poor, and that capacity of doing charitable\\nbusiness in general--in short, that taste for the sort of\\nthing--which will render them in after life a service to their\\nneighbours and a satisfaction to themselves. My young family are not\\nfrivolous; they expend the entire amount of their allowance in\\nsubscriptions, under my direction; and they have attended as many\\npublic meetings and listened to as many lectures, orations, and\\ndiscussions as generally fall to the lot of few grown people. Alfred\\n(five), who, as I mentioned, has of his own election joined the\\nInfant Bonds of Joy, was one of the very few children who manifested\\nconsciousness on that occasion after a fervid address of two hours\\nfrom the chairman of the evening.\"\\n\\nAlfred glowered at us as if he never could, or would, forgive the\\ninjury of that night.\\n\\n\"You may have observed, Miss Summerson,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"in\\nsome of the lists to which I have referred, in the possession of our\\nesteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce, that the names of my young family are\\nconcluded with the name of O. A. Pardiggle, F.R.S., one pound. That\\nis their father. We usually observe the same routine. I put down my\\nmite first; then my young family enrol their contributions, according\\nto their ages and their little means; and then Mr. Pardiggle brings\\nup the rear. Mr. Pardiggle is happy to throw in his limited donation,\\nunder my direction; and thus things are made not only pleasant to\\nourselves, but, we trust, improving to others.\"\\n\\nSuppose Mr. Pardiggle were to dine with Mr. Jellyby, and suppose Mr.\\nJellyby were to relieve his mind after dinner to Mr. Pardiggle, would\\nMr. Pardiggle, in return, make any confidential communication to Mr.\\nJellyby? I was quite confused to find myself thinking this, but it\\ncame into my head.\\n\\n\"You are very pleasantly situated here!\" said Mrs. Pardiggle.\\n\\nWe were glad to change the subject, and going to the window, pointed\\nout the beauties of the prospect, on which the spectacles appeared to\\nme to rest with curious indifference.\\n\\n\"You know Mr. Gusher?\" said our visitor.\\n\\nWe were obliged to say that we had not the pleasure of Mr. Gusher\\'s\\nacquaintance.\\n\\n\"The loss is yours, I assure you,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle with her\\ncommanding deportment. \"He is a very fervid, impassioned\\nspeaker--full of fire! Stationed in a waggon on this lawn, now,\\nwhich, from the shape of the land, is naturally adapted to a public\\nmeeting, he would improve almost any occasion you could mention for\\nhours and hours! By this time, young ladies,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle,\\nmoving back to her chair and overturning, as if by invisible agency,\\na little round table at a considerable distance with my work-basket\\non it, \"by this time you have found me out, I dare say?\"\\n\\nThis was really such a confusing question that Ada looked at me in\\nperfect dismay. As to the guilty nature of my own consciousness after\\nwhat I had been thinking, it must have been expressed in the colour\\nof my cheeks.\\n\\n\"Found out, I mean,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, \"the prominent point in my\\ncharacter. I am aware that it is so prominent as to be discoverable\\nimmediately. I lay myself open to detection, I know. Well! I freely\\nadmit, I am a woman of business. I love hard work; I enjoy hard work.\\nThe excitement does me good. I am so accustomed and inured to hard\\nwork that I don\\'t know what fatigue is.\"\\n\\nWe murmured that it was very astonishing and very gratifying, or\\nsomething to that effect. I don\\'t think we knew what it was either,\\nbut this is what our politeness expressed.\\n\\n\"I do not understand what it is to be tired; you cannot tire me if\\nyou try!\" said Mrs. Pardiggle. \"The quantity of exertion (which is no\\nexertion to me), the amount of business (which I regard as nothing),\\nthat I go through sometimes astonishes myself. I have seen my young\\nfamily, and Mr. Pardiggle, quite worn out with witnessing it, when I\\nmay truly say I have been as fresh as a lark!\"\\n\\nIf that dark-visaged eldest boy could look more malicious than he had\\nalready looked, this was the time when he did it. I observed that he\\ndoubled his right fist and delivered a secret blow into the crown of\\nhis cap, which was under his left arm.\\n\\n\"This gives me a great advantage when I am making my rounds,\" said\\nMrs. Pardiggle. \"If I find a person unwilling to hear what I have to\\nsay, I tell that person directly, \\'I am incapable of fatigue, my good\\nfriend, I am never tired, and I mean to go on until I have done.\\' It\\nanswers admirably! Miss Summerson, I hope I shall have your\\nassistance in my visiting rounds immediately, and Miss Clare\\'s very\\nsoon.\"\\n\\nAt first I tried to excuse myself for the present on the general\\nground of having occupations to attend to which I must not neglect.\\nBut as this was an ineffectual protest, I then said, more\\nparticularly, that I was not sure of my qualifications. That I was\\ninexperienced in the art of adapting my mind to minds very\\ndifferently situated, and addressing them from suitable points of\\nview. That I had not that delicate knowledge of the heart which must\\nbe essential to such a work. That I had much to learn, myself, before\\nI could teach others, and that I could not confide in my good\\nintentions alone. For these reasons I thought it best to be as useful\\nas I could, and to render what kind services I could to those\\nimmediately about me, and to try to let that circle of duty gradually\\nand naturally expand itself. All this I said with anything but\\nconfidence, because Mrs. Pardiggle was much older than I, and had\\ngreat experience, and was so very military in her manners.\\n\\n\"You are wrong, Miss Summerson,\" said she, \"but perhaps you are not\\nequal to hard work or the excitement of it, and that makes a vast\\ndifference. If you would like to see how I go through my work, I am\\nnow about--with my young family--to visit a brickmaker in the\\nneighbourhood (a very bad character) and shall be glad to take you\\nwith me. Miss Clare also, if she will do me the favour.\"\\n\\nAda and I interchanged looks, and as we were going out in any case,\\naccepted the offer. When we hastily returned from putting on our\\nbonnets, we found the young family languishing in a corner and Mrs.\\nPardiggle sweeping about the room, knocking down nearly all the light\\nobjects it contained. Mrs. Pardiggle took possession of Ada, and I\\nfollowed with the family.\\n\\nAda told me afterwards that Mrs. Pardiggle talked in the same loud\\ntone (that, indeed, I overheard) all the way to the brickmaker\\'s\\nabout an exciting contest which she had for two or three years waged\\nagainst another lady relative to the bringing in of their rival\\ncandidates for a pension somewhere. There had been a quantity of\\nprinting, and promising, and proxying, and polling, and it appeared\\nto have imparted great liveliness to all concerned, except the\\npensioners--who were not elected yet.\\n\\nI am very fond of being confided in by children and am happy in being\\nusually favoured in that respect, but on this occasion it gave me\\ngreat uneasiness. As soon as we were out of doors, Egbert, with the\\nmanner of a little footpad, demanded a shilling of me on the ground\\nthat his pocket-money was \"boned\" from him. On my pointing out the\\ngreat impropriety of the word, especially in connexion with his\\nparent (for he added sulkily \"By her!\"), he pinched me and said, \"Oh,\\nthen! Now! Who are you! YOU wouldn\\'t like it, I think? What does she\\nmake a sham for, and pretend to give me money, and take it away\\nagain? Why do you call it my allowance, and never let me spend it?\"\\nThese exasperating questions so inflamed his mind and the minds of\\nOswald and Francis that they all pinched me at once, and in a\\ndreadfully expert way--screwing up such little pieces of my arms that\\nI could hardly forbear crying out. Felix, at the same time, stamped\\nupon my toes. And the Bond of Joy, who on account of always having\\nthe whole of his little income anticipated stood in fact pledged to\\nabstain from cakes as well as tobacco, so swelled with grief and rage\\nwhen we passed a pastry-cook\\'s shop that he terrified me by becoming\\npurple. I never underwent so much, both in body and mind, in the\\ncourse of a walk with young people as from these unnaturally\\nconstrained children when they paid me the compliment of being\\nnatural.\\n\\nI was glad when we came to the brickmaker\\'s house, though it was one\\nof a cluster of wretched hovels in a brick-field, with pigsties close\\nto the broken windows and miserable little gardens before the doors\\ngrowing nothing but stagnant pools. Here and there an old tub was put\\nto catch the droppings of rain-water from a roof, or they were banked\\nup with mud into a little pond like a large dirt-pie. At the doors\\nand windows some men and women lounged or prowled about, and took\\nlittle notice of us except to laugh to one another or to say\\nsomething as we passed about gentlefolks minding their own business\\nand not troubling their heads and muddying their shoes with coming to\\nlook after other people\\'s.\\n\\nMrs. Pardiggle, leading the way with a great show of moral\\ndetermination and talking with much volubility about the untidy\\nhabits of the people (though I doubted if the best of us could have\\nbeen tidy in such a place), conducted us into a cottage at the\\nfarthest corner, the ground-floor room of which we nearly filled.\\nBesides ourselves, there were in this damp, offensive room a woman\\nwith a black eye, nursing a poor little gasping baby by the fire; a\\nman, all stained with clay and mud and looking very dissipated, lying\\nat full length on the ground, smoking a pipe; a powerful young man\\nfastening a collar on a dog; and a bold girl doing some kind of\\nwashing in very dirty water. They all looked up at us as we came in,\\nand the woman seemed to turn her face towards the fire as if to hide\\nher bruised eye; nobody gave us any welcome.\\n\\n\"Well, my friends,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, but her voice had not a\\nfriendly sound, I thought; it was much too business-like and\\nsystematic. \"How do you do, all of you? I am here again. I told you,\\nyou couldn\\'t tire me, you know. I am fond of hard work, and am true\\nto my word.\"\\n\\n\"There an\\'t,\" growled the man on the floor, whose head rested on his\\nhand as he stared at us, \"any more on you to come in, is there?\"\\n\\n\"No, my friend,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle, seating herself on one stool\\nand knocking down another. \"We are all here.\"\\n\\n\"Because I thought there warn\\'t enough of you, perhaps?\" said the\\nman, with his pipe between his lips as he looked round upon us.\\n\\nThe young man and the girl both laughed. Two friends of the young\\nman, whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with\\ntheir hands in their pockets, echoed the laugh noisily.\\n\\n\"You can\\'t tire me, good people,\" said Mrs. Pardiggle to these\\nlatter. \"I enjoy hard work, and the harder you make mine, the better\\nI like it.\"\\n\\n\"Then make it easy for her!\" growled the man upon the floor. \"I wants\\nit done, and over. I wants a end of these liberties took with my\\nplace. I wants an end of being drawed like a badger. Now you\\'re\\na-going to poll-pry and question according to custom--I know what\\nyou\\'re a-going to be up to. Well! You haven\\'t got no occasion to be\\nup to it. I\\'ll save you the trouble. Is my daughter a-washin? Yes,\\nshe IS a-washin. Look at the water. Smell it! That\\'s wot we drinks.\\nHow do you like it, and what do you think of gin instead! An\\'t my\\nplace dirty? Yes, it is dirty--it\\'s nat\\'rally dirty, and it\\'s\\nnat\\'rally onwholesome; and we\\'ve had five dirty and onwholesome\\nchildren, as is all dead infants, and so much the better for them,\\nand for us besides. Have I read the little book wot you left? No, I\\nan\\'t read the little book wot you left. There an\\'t nobody here as\\nknows how to read it; and if there wos, it wouldn\\'t be suitable to\\nme. It\\'s a book fit for a babby, and I\\'m not a babby. If you was to\\nleave me a doll, I shouldn\\'t nuss it. How have I been conducting of\\nmyself? Why, I\\'ve been drunk for three days; and I\\'da been drunk four\\nif I\\'da had the money. Don\\'t I never mean for to go to church? No, I\\ndon\\'t never mean for to go to church. I shouldn\\'t be expected there,\\nif I did; the beadle\\'s too gen-teel for me. And how did my wife get\\nthat black eye? Why, I give it her; and if she says I didn\\'t, she\\'s a\\nlie!\"\\n\\nHe had pulled his pipe out of his mouth to say all this, and he now\\nturned over on his other side and smoked again. Mrs. Pardiggle, who\\nhad been regarding him through her spectacles with a forcible\\ncomposure, calculated, I could not help thinking, to increase his\\nantagonism, pulled out a good book as if it were a constable\\'s staff\\nand took the whole family into custody. I mean into religious\\ncustody, of course; but she really did it as if she were an\\ninexorable moral policeman carrying them all off to a station-house.\\n\\nAda and I were very uncomfortable. We both felt intrusive and out of\\nplace, and we both thought that Mrs. Pardiggle would have got on\\ninfinitely better if she had not had such a mechanical way of taking\\npossession of people. The children sulked and stared; the family took\\nno notice of us whatever, except when the young man made the dog\\nbark, which he usually did when Mrs. Pardiggle was most emphatic. We\\nboth felt painfully sensible that between us and these people there\\nwas an iron barrier which could not be removed by our new friend. By\\nwhom or how it could be removed, we did not know, but we knew that.\\nEven what she read and said seemed to us to be ill-chosen for such\\nauditors, if it had been imparted ever so modestly and with ever so\\nmuch tact. As to the little book to which the man on the floor had\\nreferred, we acquired a knowledge of it afterwards, and Mr. Jarndyce\\nsaid he doubted if Robinson Crusoe could have read it, though he had\\nhad no other on his desolate island.\\n\\nWe were much relieved, under these circumstances, when Mrs. Pardiggle\\nleft off.\\n\\nThe man on the floor, then turning his head round again, said\\nmorosely, \"Well! You\\'ve done, have you?\"\\n\\n\"For to-day, I have, my friend. But I am never fatigued. I shall come\\nto you again in your regular order,\" returned Mrs. Pardiggle with\\ndemonstrative cheerfulness.\\n\\n\"So long as you goes now,\" said he, folding his arms and shutting his\\neyes with an oath, \"you may do wot you like!\"\\n\\nMrs. Pardiggle accordingly rose and made a little vortex in the\\nconfined room from which the pipe itself very narrowly escaped.\\nTaking one of her young family in each hand, and telling the others\\nto follow closely, and expressing her hope that the brickmaker and\\nall his house would be improved when she saw them next, she then\\nproceeded to another cottage. I hope it is not unkind in me to say\\nthat she certainly did make, in this as in everything else, a show\\nthat was not conciliatory of doing charity by wholesale and of\\ndealing in it to a large extent.\\n\\nShe supposed that we were following her, but as soon as the space was\\nleft clear, we approached the woman sitting by the fire to ask if the\\nbaby were ill.\\n\\nShe only looked at it as it lay on her lap. We had observed before\\nthat when she looked at it she covered her discoloured eye with her\\nhand, as though she wished to separate any association with noise and\\nviolence and ill treatment from the poor little child.\\n\\nAda, whose gentle heart was moved by its appearance, bent down to\\ntouch its little face. As she did so, I saw what happened and drew\\nher back. The child died.\\n\\n\"Oh, Esther!\" cried Ada, sinking on her knees beside it. \"Look here!\\nOh, Esther, my love, the little thing! The suffering, quiet, pretty\\nlittle thing! I am so sorry for it. I am so sorry for the mother. I\\nnever saw a sight so pitiful as this before! Oh, baby, baby!\"\\n\\nSuch compassion, such gentleness, as that with which she bent down\\nweeping and put her hand upon the mother\\'s might have softened any\\nmother\\'s heart that ever beat. The woman at first gazed at her in\\nastonishment and then burst into tears.\\n\\nPresently I took the light burden from her lap, did what I could to\\nmake the baby\\'s rest the prettier and gentler, laid it on a shelf,\\nand covered it with my own handkerchief. We tried to comfort the\\nmother, and we whispered to her what Our Saviour said of children.\\nShe answered nothing, but sat weeping--weeping very much.\\n\\nWhen I turned, I found that the young man had taken out the dog and\\nwas standing at the door looking in upon us with dry eyes, but quiet.\\nThe girl was quiet too and sat in a corner looking on the ground. The\\nman had risen. He still smoked his pipe with an air of defiance, but\\nhe was silent.\\n\\nAn ugly woman, very poorly clothed, hurried in while I was glancing\\nat them, and coming straight up to the mother, said, \"Jenny! Jenny!\"\\nThe mother rose on being so addressed and fell upon the woman\\'s neck.\\n\\nShe also had upon her face and arms the marks of ill usage. She had\\nno kind of grace about her, but the grace of sympathy; but when she\\ncondoled with the woman, and her own tears fell, she wanted no\\nbeauty. I say condoled, but her only words were \"Jenny! Jenny!\" All\\nthe rest was in the tone in which she said them.\\n\\nI thought it very touching to see these two women, coarse and shabby\\nand beaten, so united; to see what they could be to one another; to\\nsee how they felt for one another, how the heart of each to each was\\nsoftened by the hard trials of their lives. I think the best side of\\nsuch people is almost hidden from us. What the poor are to the poor\\nis little known, excepting to themselves and God.\\n\\nWe felt it better to withdraw and leave them uninterrupted. We stole\\nout quietly and without notice from any one except the man. He was\\nleaning against the wall near the door, and finding that there was\\nscarcely room for us to pass, went out before us. He seemed to want\\nto hide that he did this on our account, but we perceived that he\\ndid, and thanked him. He made no answer.\\n\\nAda was so full of grief all the way home, and Richard, whom we found\\nat home, was so distressed to see her in tears (though he said to me,\\nwhen she was not present, how beautiful it was too!), that we\\narranged to return at night with some little comforts and repeat our\\nvisit at the brick-maker\\'s house. We said as little as we could to\\nMr. Jarndyce, but the wind changed directly.\\n\\nRichard accompanied us at night to the scene of our morning\\nexpedition. On our way there, we had to pass a noisy drinking-house,\\nwhere a number of men were flocking about the door. Among them, and\\nprominent in some dispute, was the father of the little child. At a\\nshort distance, we passed the young man and the dog, in congenial\\ncompany. The sister was standing laughing and talking with some other\\nyoung women at the corner of the row of cottages, but she seemed\\nashamed and turned away as we went by.\\n\\nWe left our escort within sight of the brickmaker\\'s dwelling and\\nproceeded by ourselves. When we came to the door, we found the woman\\nwho had brought such consolation with her standing there looking\\nanxiously out.\\n\\n\"It\\'s you, young ladies, is it?\" she said in a whisper. \"I\\'m\\na-watching for my master. My heart\\'s in my mouth. If he was to catch\\nme away from home, he\\'d pretty near murder me.\"\\n\\n\"Do you mean your husband?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Yes, miss, my master. Jenny\\'s asleep, quite worn out. She\\'s scarcely\\nhad the child off her lap, poor thing, these seven days and nights,\\nexcept when I\\'ve been able to take it for a minute or two.\"\\n\\nAs she gave way for us, she went softly in and put what we had\\nbrought near the miserable bed on which the mother slept. No effort\\nhad been made to clean the room--it seemed in its nature almost\\nhopeless of being clean; but the small waxen form from which so much\\nsolemnity diffused itself had been composed afresh, and washed, and\\nneatly dressed in some fragments of white linen; and on my\\nhandkerchief, which still covered the poor baby, a little bunch of\\nsweet herbs had been laid by the same rough, scarred hands, so\\nlightly, so tenderly!\\n\\n\"May heaven reward you!\" we said to her. \"You are a good woman.\"\\n\\n\"Me, young ladies?\" she returned with surprise. \"Hush! Jenny, Jenny!\"\\n\\nThe mother had moaned in her sleep and moved. The sound of the\\nfamiliar voice seemed to calm her again. She was quiet once more.\\n\\nHow little I thought, when I raised my handkerchief to look upon the\\ntiny sleeper underneath and seemed to see a halo shine around the\\nchild through Ada\\'s drooping hair as her pity bent her head--how\\nlittle I thought in whose unquiet bosom that handkerchief would come\\nto lie after covering the motionless and peaceful breast! I only\\nthought that perhaps the Angel of the child might not be all\\nunconscious of the woman who replaced it with so compassionate a\\nhand; not all unconscious of her presently, when we had taken leave,\\nand left her at the door, by turns looking, and listening in terror\\nfor herself, and saying in her old soothing manner, \"Jenny, Jenny!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know how it is I seem to be always writing about myself. I\\nmean all the time to write about other people, and I try to think\\nabout myself as little as possible, and I am sure, when I find myself\\ncoming into the story again, I am really vexed and say, \"Dear, dear,\\nyou tiresome little creature, I wish you wouldn\\'t!\" but it is all of\\nno use. I hope any one who may read what I write will understand that\\nif these pages contain a great deal about me, I can only suppose it\\nmust be because I have really something to do with them and can\\'t be\\nkept out.\\n\\nMy darling and I read together, and worked, and practised, and found\\nso much employment for our time that the winter days flew by us like\\nbright-winged birds. Generally in the afternoons, and always in the\\nevenings, Richard gave us his company. Although he was one of the\\nmost restless creatures in the world, he certainly was very fond of\\nour society.\\n\\nHe was very, very, very fond of Ada. I mean it, and I had better say\\nit at once. I had never seen any young people falling in love before,\\nbut I found them out quite soon. I could not say so, of course, or\\nshow that I knew anything about it. On the contrary, I was so demure\\nand used to seem so unconscious that sometimes I considered within\\nmyself while I was sitting at work whether I was not growing quite\\ndeceitful.\\n\\nBut there was no help for it. All I had to do was to be quiet, and I\\nwas as quiet as a mouse. They were as quiet as mice too, so far as\\nany words were concerned, but the innocent manner in which they\\nrelied more and more upon me as they took more and more to one\\nanother was so charming that I had great difficulty in not showing\\nhow it interested me.\\n\\n\"Our dear little old woman is such a capital old woman,\" Richard\\nwould say, coming up to meet me in the garden early, with his\\npleasant laugh and perhaps the least tinge of a blush, \"that I can\\'t\\nget on without her. Before I begin my harum-scarum day--grinding away\\nat those books and instruments and then galloping up hill and down\\ndale, all the country round, like a highwayman--it does me so much\\ngood to come and have a steady walk with our comfortable friend, that\\nhere I am again!\"\\n\\n\"You know, Dame Durden, dear,\" Ada would say at night, with her head\\nupon my shoulder and the firelight shining in her thoughtful eyes, \"I\\ndon\\'t want to talk when we come upstairs here. Only to sit a little\\nwhile thinking, with your dear face for company, and to hear the wind\\nand remember the poor sailors at sea--\"\\n\\nAh! Perhaps Richard was going to be a sailor. We had talked it over\\nvery often now, and there was some talk of gratifying the inclination\\nof his childhood for the sea. Mr. Jarndyce had written to a relation\\nof the family, a great Sir Leicester Dedlock, for his interest in\\nRichard\\'s favour, generally; and Sir Leicester had replied in a\\ngracious manner that he would be happy to advance the prospects of\\nthe young gentleman if it should ever prove to be within his power,\\nwhich was not at all probable, and that my Lady sent her compliments\\nto the young gentleman (to whom she perfectly remembered that she was\\nallied by remote consanguinity) and trusted that he would ever do his\\nduty in any honourable profession to which he might devote himself.\\n\\n\"So I apprehend it\\'s pretty clear,\" said Richard to me, \"that I shall\\nhave to work my own way. Never mind! Plenty of people have had to do\\nthat before now, and have done it. I only wish I had the command of a\\nclipping privateer to begin with and could carry off the Chancellor\\nand keep him on short allowance until he gave judgment in our cause.\\nHe\\'d find himself growing thin, if he didn\\'t look sharp!\"\\n\\nWith a buoyancy and hopefulness and a gaiety that hardly ever\\nflagged, Richard had a carelessness in his character that quite\\nperplexed me, principally because he mistook it, in such a very odd\\nway, for prudence. It entered into all his calculations about money\\nin a singular manner which I don\\'t think I can better explain than by\\nreverting for a moment to our loan to Mr. Skimpole.\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce had ascertained the amount, either from Mr. Skimpole\\nhimself or from Coavinses, and had placed the money in my hands with\\ninstructions to me to retain my own part of it and hand the rest to\\nRichard. The number of little acts of thoughtless expenditure which\\nRichard justified by the recovery of his ten pounds, and the number\\nof times he talked to me as if he had saved or realized that amount,\\nwould form a sum in simple addition.\\n\\n\"My prudent Mother Hubbard, why not?\" he said to me when he wanted,\\nwithout the least consideration, to bestow five pounds on the\\nbrickmaker. \"I made ten pounds, clear, out of Coavinses\\' business.\"\\n\\n\"How was that?\" said I.\\n\\n\"Why, I got rid of ten pounds which I was quite content to get rid of\\nand never expected to see any more. You don\\'t deny that?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Very well! Then I came into possession of ten pounds--\"\\n\\n\"The same ten pounds,\" I hinted.\\n\\n\"That has nothing to do with it!\" returned Richard. \"I have got ten\\npounds more than I expected to have, and consequently I can afford to\\nspend it without being particular.\"\\n\\nIn exactly the same way, when he was persuaded out of the sacrifice\\nof these five pounds by being convinced that it would do no good, he\\ncarried that sum to his credit and drew upon it.\\n\\n\"Let me see!\" he would say. \"I saved five pounds out of the\\nbrickmaker\\'s affair, so if I have a good rattle to London and back in\\na post-chaise and put that down at four pounds, I shall have saved\\none. And it\\'s a very good thing to save one, let me tell you: a penny\\nsaved is a penny got!\"\\n\\nI believe Richard\\'s was as frank and generous a nature as there\\npossibly can be. He was ardent and brave, and in the midst of all his\\nwild restlessness, was so gentle that I knew him like a brother in a\\nfew weeks. His gentleness was natural to him and would have shown\\nitself abundantly even without Ada\\'s influence; but with it, he\\nbecame one of the most winning of companions, always so ready to be\\ninterested and always so happy, sanguine, and light-hearted. I am\\nsure that I, sitting with them, and walking with them, and talking\\nwith them, and noticing from day to day how they went on, falling\\ndeeper and deeper in love, and saying nothing about it, and each\\nshyly thinking that this love was the greatest of secrets, perhaps\\nnot yet suspected even by the other--I am sure that I was scarcely\\nless enchanted than they were and scarcely less pleased with the\\npretty dream.\\n\\nWe were going on in this way, when one morning at breakfast Mr.\\nJarndyce received a letter, and looking at the superscription, said,\\n\"From Boythorn? Aye, aye!\" and opened and read it with evident\\npleasure, announcing to us in a parenthesis when he was about\\nhalf-way through, that Boythorn was \"coming down\" on a visit. Now who\\nwas Boythorn, we all thought. And I dare say we all thought too--I am\\nsure I did, for one--would Boythorn at all interfere with what was\\ngoing forward?\\n\\n\"I went to school with this fellow, Lawrence Boythorn,\" said Mr.\\nJarndyce, tapping the letter as he laid it on the table, \"more than\\nfive and forty years ago. He was then the most impetuous boy in the\\nworld, and he is now the most impetuous man. He was then the loudest\\nboy in the world, and he is now the loudest man. He was then the\\nheartiest and sturdiest boy in the world, and he is now the heartiest\\nand sturdiest man. He is a tremendous fellow.\"\\n\\n\"In stature, sir?\" asked Richard.\\n\\n\"Pretty well, Rick, in that respect,\" said Mr. Jarndyce; \"being some\\nten years older than I and a couple of inches taller, with his head\\nthrown back like an old soldier, his stalwart chest squared, his\\nhands like a clean blacksmith\\'s, and his lungs! There\\'s no simile for\\nhis lungs. Talking, laughing, or snoring, they make the beams of the\\nhouse shake.\"\\n\\nAs Mr. Jarndyce sat enjoying the image of his friend Boythorn, we\\nobserved the favourable omen that there was not the least indication\\nof any change in the wind.\\n\\n\"But it\\'s the inside of the man, the warm heart of the man, the\\npassion of the man, the fresh blood of the man, Rick--and Ada, and\\nlittle Cobweb too, for you are all interested in a visitor--that I\\nspeak of,\" he pursued. \"His language is as sounding as his voice. He\\nis always in extremes, perpetually in the superlative degree. In his\\ncondemnation he is all ferocity. You might suppose him to be an ogre\\nfrom what he says, and I believe he has the reputation of one with\\nsome people. There! I tell you no more of him beforehand. You must\\nnot be surprised to see him take me under his protection, for he has\\nnever forgotten that I was a low boy at school and that our\\nfriendship began in his knocking two of my head tyrant\\'s teeth out\\n(he says six) before breakfast. Boythorn and his man,\" to me, \"will\\nbe here this afternoon, my dear.\"\\n\\nI took care that the necessary preparations were made for Mr.\\nBoythorn\\'s reception, and we looked forward to his arrival with some\\ncuriosity. The afternoon wore away, however, and he did not appear.\\nThe dinner-hour arrived, and still he did not appear. The dinner was\\nput back an hour, and we were sitting round the fire with no light\\nbut the blaze when the hall-door suddenly burst open and the hall\\nresounded with these words, uttered with the greatest vehemence and\\nin a stentorian tone: \"We have been misdirected, Jarndyce, by a most\\nabandoned ruffian, who told us to take the turning to the right\\ninstead of to the left. He is the most intolerable scoundrel on the\\nface of the earth. His father must have been a most consummate\\nvillain, ever to have such a son. I would have had that fellow shot\\nwithout the least remorse!\"\\n\\n\"Did he do it on purpose?\" Mr. Jarndyce inquired.\\n\\n\"I have not the slightest doubt that the scoundrel has passed his\\nwhole existence in misdirecting travellers!\" returned the other. \"By\\nmy soul, I thought him the worst-looking dog I had ever beheld when\\nhe was telling me to take the turning to the right. And yet I stood\\nbefore that fellow face to face and didn\\'t knock his brains out!\"\\n\\n\"Teeth, you mean?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Ha, ha, ha!\" laughed Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, really making the whole\\nhouse vibrate. \"What, you have not forgotten it yet! Ha, ha, ha! And\\nthat was another most consummate vagabond! By my soul, the\\ncountenance of that fellow when he was a boy was the blackest image\\nof perfidy, cowardice, and cruelty ever set up as a scarecrow in a\\nfield of scoundrels. If I were to meet that most unparalleled despot\\nin the streets to-morrow, I would fell him like a rotten tree!\"\\n\\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"Now, will you come\\nupstairs?\"\\n\\n\"By my soul, Jarndyce,\" returned his guest, who seemed to refer to\\nhis watch, \"if you had been married, I would have turned back at the\\ngarden-gate and gone away to the remotest summits of the Himalaya\\nMountains sooner than I would have presented myself at this\\nunseasonable hour.\"\\n\\n\"Not quite so far, I hope?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"By my life and honour, yes!\" cried the visitor. \"I wouldn\\'t be\\nguilty of the audacious insolence of keeping a lady of the house\\nwaiting all this time for any earthly consideration. I would\\ninfinitely rather destroy myself--infinitely rather!\"\\n\\nTalking thus, they went upstairs, and presently we heard him in his\\nbedroom thundering \"Ha, ha, ha!\" and again \"Ha, ha, ha!\" until the\\nflattest echo in the neighbourhood seemed to catch the contagion and\\nto laugh as enjoyingly as he did or as we did when we heard him\\nlaugh.\\n\\nWe all conceived a prepossession in his favour, for there was a\\nsterling quality in this laugh, and in his vigorous, healthy voice,\\nand in the roundness and fullness with which he uttered every word he\\nspoke, and in the very fury of his superlatives, which seemed to go\\noff like blank cannons and hurt nothing. But we were hardly prepared\\nto have it so confirmed by his appearance when Mr. Jarndyce presented\\nhim. He was not only a very handsome old gentleman--upright and\\nstalwart as he had been described to us--with a massive grey head, a\\nfine composure of face when silent, a figure that might have become\\ncorpulent but for his being so continually in earnest that he gave it\\nno rest, and a chin that might have subsided into a double chin but\\nfor the vehement emphasis in which it was constantly required to\\nassist; but he was such a true gentleman in his manner, so\\nchivalrously polite, his face was lighted by a smile of so much\\nsweetness and tenderness, and it seemed so plain that he had nothing\\nto hide, but showed himself exactly as he was--incapable, as Richard\\nsaid, of anything on a limited scale, and firing away with those\\nblank great guns because he carried no small arms whatever--that\\nreally I could not help looking at him with equal pleasure as he sat\\nat dinner, whether he smilingly conversed with Ada and me, or was led\\nby Mr. Jarndyce into some great volley of superlatives, or threw up\\nhis head like a bloodhound and gave out that tremendous \"Ha, ha, ha!\"\\n\\n\"You have brought your bird with you, I suppose?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"By heaven, he is the most astonishing bird in Europe!\" replied the\\nother. \"He IS the most wonderful creature! I wouldn\\'t take ten\\nthousand guineas for that bird. I have left an annuity for his sole\\nsupport in case he should outlive me. He is, in sense and attachment,\\na phenomenon. And his father before him was one of the most\\nastonishing birds that ever lived!\"\\n\\nThe subject of this laudation was a very little canary, who was so\\ntame that he was brought down by Mr. Boythorn\\'s man, on his\\nforefinger, and after taking a gentle flight round the room, alighted\\non his master\\'s head. To hear Mr. Boythorn presently expressing the\\nmost implacable and passionate sentiments, with this fragile mite of\\na creature quietly perched on his forehead, was to have a good\\nillustration of his character, I thought.\\n\\n\"By my soul, Jarndyce,\" he said, very gently holding up a bit of\\nbread to the canary to peck at, \"if I were in your place I would\\nseize every master in Chancery by the throat to-morrow morning and\\nshake him until his money rolled out of his pockets and his bones\\nrattled in his skin. I would have a settlement out of somebody, by\\nfair means or by foul. If you would empower me to do it, I would do\\nit for you with the greatest satisfaction!\" (All this time the very\\nsmall canary was eating out of his hand.)\\n\\n\"I thank you, Lawrence, but the suit is hardly at such a point at\\npresent,\" returned Mr. Jarndyce, laughing, \"that it would be greatly\\nadvanced even by the legal process of shaking the bench and the whole\\nbar.\"\\n\\n\"There never was such an infernal cauldron as that Chancery on the\\nface of the earth!\" said Mr. Boythorn. \"Nothing but a mine below it\\non a busy day in term time, with all its records, rules, and\\nprecedents collected in it and every functionary belonging to it\\nalso, high and low, upward and downward, from its son the\\nAccountant-General to its father the Devil, and the whole blown to\\natoms with ten thousand hundredweight of gunpowder, would reform it\\nin the least!\"\\n\\nIt was impossible not to laugh at the energetic gravity with which he\\nrecommended this strong measure of reform. When we laughed, he threw\\nup his head and shook his broad chest, and again the whole country\\nseemed to echo to his \"Ha, ha, ha!\" It had not the least effect in\\ndisturbing the bird, whose sense of security was complete and who\\nhopped about the table with its quick head now on this side and now\\non that, turning its bright sudden eye on its master as if he were no\\nmore than another bird.\\n\\n\"But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right of\\nway?\" said Mr. Jarndyce. \"You are not free from the toils of the law\\nyourself!\"\\n\\n\"The fellow has brought actions against ME for trespass, and I have\\nbrought actions against HIM for trespass,\" returned Mr. Boythorn. \"By\\nheaven, he is the proudest fellow breathing. It is morally impossible\\nthat his name can be Sir Leicester. It must be Sir Lucifer.\"\\n\\n\"Complimentary to our distant relation!\" said my guardian laughingly\\nto Ada and Richard.\\n\\n\"I would beg Miss Clare\\'s pardon and Mr. Carstone\\'s pardon,\" resumed\\nour visitor, \"if I were not reassured by seeing in the fair face of\\nthe lady and the smile of the gentleman that it is quite unnecessary\\nand that they keep their distant relation at a comfortable distance.\"\\n\\n\"Or he keeps us,\" suggested Richard.\\n\\n\"By my soul,\" exclaimed Mr. Boythorn, suddenly firing another volley,\\n\"that fellow is, and his father was, and his grandfather was, the\\nmost stiff-necked, arrogant imbecile, pig-headed numskull, ever, by\\nsome inexplicable mistake of Nature, born in any station of life but\\na walking-stick\\'s! The whole of that family are the most solemnly\\nconceited and consummate blockheads! But it\\'s no matter; he should\\nnot shut up my path if he were fifty baronets melted into one and\\nliving in a hundred Chesney Wolds, one within another, like the ivory\\nballs in a Chinese carving. The fellow, by his agent, or secretary,\\nor somebody, writes to me \\'Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, presents\\nhis compliments to Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, and has to call his\\nattention to the fact that the green pathway by the old\\nparsonage-house, now the property of Mr. Lawrence Boythorn, is Sir\\nLeicester\\'s right of way, being in fact a portion of the park of\\nChesney Wold, and that Sir Leicester finds it convenient to close up\\nthe same.\\' I write to the fellow, \\'Mr. Lawrence Boythorn presents his\\ncompliments to Sir Leicester Dedlock, Baronet, and has to call HIS\\nattention to the fact that he totally denies the whole of Sir\\nLeicester Dedlock\\'s positions on every possible subject and has to\\nadd, in reference to closing up the pathway, that he will be glad to\\nsee the man who may undertake to do it.\\' The fellow sends a most\\nabandoned villain with one eye to construct a gateway. I play upon\\nthat execrable scoundrel with a fire-engine until the breath is\\nnearly driven out of his body. The fellow erects a gate in the night.\\nI chop it down and burn it in the morning. He sends his myrmidons to\\ncome over the fence and pass and repass. I catch them in humane man\\ntraps, fire split peas at their legs, play upon them with the\\nengine--resolve to free mankind from the insupportable burden of the\\nexistence of those lurking ruffians. He brings actions for trespass;\\nI bring actions for trespass. He brings actions for assault and\\nbattery; I defend them and continue to assault and batter. Ha, ha,\\nha!\"\\n\\nTo hear him say all this with unimaginable energy, one might have\\nthought him the angriest of mankind. To see him at the very same\\ntime, looking at the bird now perched upon his thumb and softly\\nsmoothing its feathers with his forefinger, one might have thought\\nhim the gentlest. To hear him laugh and see the broad good nature of\\nhis face then, one might have supposed that he had not a care in the\\nworld, or a dispute, or a dislike, but that his whole existence was a\\nsummer joke.\\n\\n\"No, no,\" he said, \"no closing up of my paths by any Dedlock! Though\\nI willingly confess,\" here he softened in a moment, \"that Lady\\nDedlock is the most accomplished lady in the world, to whom I would\\ndo any homage that a plain gentleman, and no baronet with a head\\nseven hundred years thick, may. A man who joined his regiment at\\ntwenty and within a week challenged the most imperious and\\npresumptuous coxcomb of a commanding officer that ever drew the\\nbreath of life through a tight waist--and got broke for it--is not\\nthe man to be walked over by all the Sir Lucifers, dead or alive,\\nlocked or unlocked. Ha, ha, ha!\"\\n\\n\"Nor the man to allow his junior to be walked over either?\" said my\\nguardian.\\n\\n\"Most assuredly not!\" said Mr. Boythorn, clapping him on the shoulder\\nwith an air of protection that had something serious in it, though he\\nlaughed. \"He will stand by the low boy, always. Jarndyce, you may\\nrely upon him! But speaking of this trespass--with apologies to Miss\\nClare and Miss Summerson for the length at which I have pursued so\\ndry a subject--is there nothing for me from your men Kenge and\\nCarboy?\"\\n\\n\"I think not, Esther?\" said Mr. Jarndyce.\\n\\n\"Nothing, guardian.\"\\n\\n\"Much obliged!\" said Mr. Boythorn. \"Had no need to ask, after even my\\nslight experience of Miss Summerson\\'s forethought for every one about\\nher.\" (They all encouraged me; they were determined to do it.) \"I\\ninquired because, coming from Lincolnshire, I of course have not yet\\nbeen in town, and I thought some letters might have been sent down\\nhere. I dare say they will report progress to-morrow morning.\"\\n\\nI saw him so often in the course of the evening, which passed very\\npleasantly, contemplate Richard and Ada with an interest and a\\nsatisfaction that made his fine face remarkably agreeable as he sat\\nat a little distance from the piano listening to the music--and he\\nhad small occasion to tell us that he was passionately fond of music,\\nfor his face showed it--that I asked my guardian as we sat at the\\nbackgammon board whether Mr. Boythorn had ever been married.\\n\\n\"No,\" said he. \"No.\"\\n\\n\"But he meant to be!\" said I.\\n\\n\"How did you find out that?\" he returned with a smile. \"Why,\\nguardian,\" I explained, not without reddening a little at hazarding\\nwhat was in my thoughts, \"there is something so tender in his manner,\\nafter all, and he is so very courtly and gentle to us, and--\"\\n\\nMr. Jarndyce directed his eyes to where he was sitting as I have just\\ndescribed him.\\n\\nI said no more.\\n\\n\"You are right, little woman,\" he answered. \"He was all but married\\nonce. Long ago. And once.\"\\n\\n\"Did the lady die?\"\\n\\n\"No--but she died to him. That time has had its influence on all his\\nlater life. Would you suppose him to have a head and a heart full of\\nromance yet?\"\\n\\n\"I think, guardian, I might have supposed so. But it is easy to say\\nthat when you have told me so.\"\\n\\n\"He has never since been what he might have been,\" said Mr. Jarndyce,\\n\"and now you see him in his age with no one near him but his servant\\nand his little yellow friend. It\\'s your throw, my dear!\"\\n\\nI felt, from my guardian\\'s manner, that beyond this point I could not\\npursue the subject without changing the wind. I therefore forbore to\\nask any further questions. I was interested, but not curious. I\\nthought a little while about this old love story in the night, when I\\nwas awakened by Mr. Boythorn\\'s lusty snoring; and I tried to do that\\nvery difficult thing, imagine old people young again and invested\\nwith the graces of youth. But I fell asleep before I had succeeded,\\nand dreamed of the days when I lived in my godmother\\'s house. I am\\nnot sufficiently acquainted with such subjects to know whether it is\\nat all remarkable that I almost always dreamed of that period of my\\nlife.\\n\\nWith the morning there came a letter from Messrs. Kenge and Carboy to\\nMr. Boythorn informing him that one of their clerks would wait upon\\nhim at noon. As it was the day of the week on which I paid the bills,\\nand added up my books, and made all the household affairs as compact\\nas possible, I remained at home while Mr. Jarndyce, Ada, and Richard\\ntook advantage of a very fine day to make a little excursion, Mr.\\nBoythorn was to wait for Kenge and Carboy\\'s clerk and then was to go\\non foot to meet them on their return.\\n\\nWell! I was full of business, examining tradesmen\\'s books, adding up\\ncolumns, paying money, filing receipts, and I dare say making a great\\nbustle about it when Mr. Guppy was announced and shown in. I had had\\nsome idea that the clerk who was to be sent down might be the young\\ngentleman who had met me at the coach-office, and I was glad to see\\nhim, because he was associated with my present happiness.\\n\\nI scarcely knew him again, he was so uncommonly smart. He had an\\nentirely new suit of glossy clothes on, a shining hat, lilac-kid\\ngloves, a neckerchief of a variety of colours, a large hot-house\\nflower in his button-hole, and a thick gold ring on his little\\nfinger. Besides which, he quite scented the dining-room with\\nbear\\'s-grease and other perfumery. He looked at me with an attention\\nthat quite confused me when I begged him to take a seat until the\\nservant should return; and as he sat there crossing and uncrossing\\nhis legs in a corner, and I asked him if he had had a pleasant ride,\\nand hoped that Mr. Kenge was well, I never looked at him, but I found\\nhim looking at me in the same scrutinizing and curious way.\\n\\nWhen the request was brought to him that he would go upstairs to Mr.\\nBoythorn\\'s room, I mentioned that he would find lunch prepared for\\nhim when he came down, of which Mr. Jarndyce hoped he would partake.\\nHe said with some embarrassment, holding the handle of the door,\\n\"Shall I have the honour of finding you here, miss?\" I replied yes, I\\nshould be there; and he went out with a bow and another look.\\n\\nI thought him only awkward and shy, for he was evidently much\\nembarrassed; and I fancied that the best thing I could do would be to\\nwait until I saw that he had everything he wanted and then to leave\\nhim to himself. The lunch was soon brought, but it remained for some\\ntime on the table. The interview with Mr. Boythorn was a long one,\\nand a stormy one too, I should think, for although his room was at\\nsome distance I heard his loud voice rising every now and then like a\\nhigh wind, and evidently blowing perfect broadsides of denunciation.\\n\\nAt last Mr. Guppy came back, looking something the worse for the\\nconference. \"My eye, miss,\" he said in a low voice, \"he\\'s a Tartar!\"\\n\\n\"Pray take some refreshment, sir,\" said I.\\n\\nMr. Guppy sat down at the table and began nervously sharpening the\\ncarving-knife on the carving-fork, still looking at me (as I felt\\nquite sure without looking at him) in the same unusual manner. The\\nsharpening lasted so long that at last I felt a kind of obligation on\\nme to raise my eyes in order that I might break the spell under which\\nhe seemed to labour, of not being able to leave off.\\n\\nHe immediately looked at the dish and began to carve.\\n\\n\"What will you take yourself, miss? You\\'ll take a morsel of\\nsomething?\"\\n\\n\"No, thank you,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Shan\\'t I give you a piece of anything at all, miss?\" said Mr. Guppy,\\nhurriedly drinking off a glass of wine.\\n\\n\"Nothing, thank you,\" said I. \"I have only waited to see that you\\nhave everything you want. Is there anything I can order for you?\"\\n\\n\"No, I am much obliged to you, miss, I\\'m sure. I\\'ve everything that I\\ncan require to make me comfortable--at least I--not comfortable--I\\'m\\nnever that.\" He drank off two more glasses of wine, one after\\nanother.\\n\\nI thought I had better go.\\n\\n\"I beg your pardon, miss!\" said Mr. Guppy, rising when he saw me\\nrise. \"But would you allow me the favour of a minute\\'s private\\nconversation?\"\\n\\nNot knowing what to say, I sat down again.\\n\\n\"What follows is without prejudice, miss?\" said Mr. Guppy, anxiously\\nbringing a chair towards my table.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t understand what you mean,\" said I, wondering.\\n\\n\"It\\'s one of our law terms, miss. You won\\'t make any use of it to my\\ndetriment at Kenge and Carboy\\'s or elsewhere. If our conversation\\nshouldn\\'t lead to anything, I am to be as I was and am not to be\\nprejudiced in my situation or worldly prospects. In short, it\\'s in\\ntotal confidence.\"\\n\\n\"I am at a loss, sir,\" said I, \"to imagine what you can have to\\ncommunicate in total confidence to me, whom you have never seen but\\nonce; but I should be very sorry to do you any injury.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, miss. I\\'m sure of it--that\\'s quite sufficient.\" All this\\ntime Mr. Guppy was either planing his forehead with his handkerchief\\nor tightly rubbing the palm of his left hand with the palm of his\\nright. \"If you would excuse my taking another glass of wine, miss, I\\nthink it might assist me in getting on without a continual choke that\\ncannot fail to be mutually unpleasant.\"\\n\\nHe did so, and came back again. I took the opportunity of moving well\\nbehind my table.\\n\\n\"You wouldn\\'t allow me to offer you one, would you miss?\" said Mr.\\nGuppy, apparently refreshed.\\n\\n\"Not any,\" said I.\\n\\n\"Not half a glass?\" said Mr. Guppy. \"Quarter? No! Then, to proceed.\\nMy present salary, Miss Summerson, at Kenge and Carboy\\'s, is two\\npound a week. When I first had the happiness of looking upon you, it\\nwas one fifteen, and had stood at that figure for a lengthened\\nperiod. A rise of five has since taken place, and a further rise of\\nfive is guaranteed at the expiration of a term not exceeding twelve\\nmonths from the present date. My mother has a little property, which\\ntakes the form of a small life annuity, upon which she lives in an\\nindependent though unassuming manner in the Old Street Road. She is\\neminently calculated for a mother-in-law. She never interferes, is\\nall for peace, and her disposition easy. She has her failings--as who\\nhas not?--but I never knew her do it when company was present, at\\nwhich time you may freely trust her with wines, spirits, or malt\\nliquors. My own abode is lodgings at Penton Place, Pentonville. It is\\nlowly, but airy, open at the back, and considered one of the\\n\\'ealthiest outlets. Miss Summerson! In the mildest language, I adore\\nyou. Would you be so kind as to allow me (as I may say) to file a\\ndeclaration--to make an offer!\"\\n\\nMr. Guppy went down on his knees. I was well behind my table and not\\nmuch frightened. I said, \"Get up from that ridiculous position\\nimmediately, sir, or you will oblige me to break my implied promise\\nand ring the bell!\"\\n\\n\"Hear me out, miss!\" said Mr. Guppy, folding his hands.\\n\\n\"I cannot consent to hear another word, sir,\" I returned, \"Unless you\\nget up from the carpet directly and go and sit down at the table as\\nyou ought to do if you have any sense at all.\"\\n\\nHe looked piteously, but slowly rose and did so.\\n\\n\"Yet what a mockery it is, miss,\" he said with his hand upon his\\nheart and shaking his head at me in a melancholy manner over the\\ntray, \"to be stationed behind food at such a moment. The soul recoils\\nfrom food at such a moment, miss.\"\\n\\n\"I beg you to conclude,\" said I; \"you have asked me to hear you out,\\nand I beg you to conclude.\"\\n\\n\"I will, miss,\" said Mr. Guppy. \"As I love and honour, so likewise I\\nobey. Would that I could make thee the subject of that vow before the\\nshrine!\"\\n\\n\"That is quite impossible,\" said I, \"and entirely out of the\\nquestion.\"\\n\\n\"I am aware,\" said Mr. Guppy, leaning forward over the tray and\\nregarding me, as I again strangely felt, though my eyes were not\\ndirected to him, with his late intent look, \"I am aware that in a\\nworldly point of view, according to all appearances, my offer is a\\npoor one. But, Miss Summerson! Angel! No, don\\'t ring--I have been\\nbrought up in a sharp school and am accustomed to a variety of\\ngeneral practice. Though a young man, I have ferreted out evidence,\\ngot up cases, and seen lots of life. Blest with your hand, what means\\nmight I not find of advancing your interests and pushing your\\nfortunes! What might I not get to know, nearly concerning you? I know\\nnothing now, certainly; but what MIGHT I not if I had your\\nconfidence, and you set me on?\"\\n\\nI told him that he addressed my interest or what he supposed to be my\\ninterest quite as unsuccessfully as he addressed my inclination, and\\nhe would now understand that I requested him, if he pleased, to go\\naway immediately.\\n\\n\"Cruel miss,\" said Mr. Guppy, \"hear but another word! I think you\\nmust have seen that I was struck with those charms on the day when I\\nwaited at the Whytorseller. I think you must have remarked that I\\ncould not forbear a tribute to those charms when I put up the steps\\nof the \\'ackney-coach. It was a feeble tribute to thee, but it was\\nwell meant. Thy image has ever since been fixed in my breast. I have\\nwalked up and down of an evening opposite Jellyby\\'s house only to\\nlook upon the bricks that once contained thee. This out of to-day,\\nquite an unnecessary out so far as the attendance, which was its\\npretended object, went, was planned by me alone for thee alone. If I\\nspeak of interest, it is only to recommend myself and my respectful\\nwretchedness. Love was before it, and is before it.\"\\n\\n\"I should be pained, Mr. Guppy,\" said I, rising and putting my hand\\nupon the bell-rope, \"to do you or any one who was sincere the\\ninjustice of slighting any honest feeling, however disagreeably\\nexpressed. If you have really meant to give me a proof of your good\\nopinion, though ill-timed and misplaced, I feel that I ought to thank\\nyou. I have very little reason to be proud, and I am not proud. I\\nhope,\" I think I added, without very well knowing what I said, \"that\\nyou will now go away as if you had never been so exceedingly foolish\\nand attend to Messrs. Kenge and Carboy\\'s business.\"\\n\\n\"Half a minute, miss!\" cried Mr. Guppy, checking me as I was about to\\nring. \"This has been without prejudice?\"\\n\\n\"I will never mention it,\" said I, \"unless you should give me future\\noccasion to do so.\"\\n\\n\"A quarter of a minute, miss! In case you should think better at any\\ntime, however distant--THAT\\'S no consequence, for my feelings can\\nnever alter--of anything I have said, particularly what might I not\\ndo, Mr. William Guppy, eighty-seven, Penton Place, or if removed, or\\ndead (of blighted hopes or anything of that sort), care of Mrs.\\nGuppy, three hundred and two, Old Street Road, will be sufficient.\"\\n\\nI rang the bell, the servant came, and Mr. Guppy, laying his written\\ncard upon the table and making a dejected bow, departed. Raising my\\neyes as he went out, I once more saw him looking at me after he had\\npassed the door.\\n\\nI sat there for another hour or more, finishing my books and payments\\nand getting through plenty of business. Then I arranged my desk, and\\nput everything away, and was so composed and cheerful that I thought\\nI had quite dismissed this unexpected incident. But, when I went\\nupstairs to my own room, I surprised myself by beginning to laugh\\nabout it and then surprised myself still more by beginning to cry\\nabout it. In short, I was in a flutter for a little while and felt as\\nif an old chord had been more coarsely touched than it ever had been\\nsince the days of the dear old doll, long buried in the garden.\\n\\n\\n\\nOn the eastern borders of Chancery Lane, that is to say, more\\nparticularly in Cook\\'s Court, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby,\\nlaw-stationer, pursues his lawful calling. In the shade of Cook\\'s\\nCourt, at most times a shady place, Mr. Snagsby has dealt in\\nall sorts of blank forms of legal process; in skins and rolls\\nof parchment; in paper--foolscap, brief, draft, brown, white,\\nwhitey-brown, and blotting; in stamps; in office-quills, pens,\\nink, India-rubber, pounce, pins, pencils, sealing-wax, and\\nwafers; in red tape and green ferret; in pocket-books, almanacs,\\ndiaries, and law lists; in string boxes, rulers, inkstands--glass\\nand leaden--pen-knives, scissors, bodkins, and other small\\noffice-cutlery; in short, in articles too numerous to mention, ever\\nsince he was out of his time and went into partnership with Peffer.\\nOn that occasion, Cook\\'s Court was in a manner revolutionized by the\\nnew inscription in fresh paint, PEFFER AND SNAGSBY, displacing the\\ntime-honoured and not easily to be deciphered legend PEFFER only. For\\nsmoke, which is the London ivy, had so wreathed itself round Peffer\\'s\\nname and clung to his dwelling-place that the affectionate parasite\\nquite overpowered the parent tree.\\n\\nPeffer is never seen in Cook\\'s Court now. He is not expected there,\\nfor he has been recumbent this quarter of a century in the churchyard\\nof St. Andrews, Holborn, with the waggons and hackney-coaches roaring\\npast him all the day and half the night like one great dragon. If he\\never steal forth when the dragon is at rest to air himself again in\\nCook\\'s Court until admonished to return by the crowing of the\\nsanguine cock in the cellar at the little dairy in Cursitor Street,\\nwhose ideas of daylight it would be curious to ascertain, since he\\nknows from his personal observation next to nothing about it--if\\nPeffer ever do revisit the pale glimpses of Cook\\'s Court, which no\\nlaw-stationer in the trade can positively deny, he comes invisibly,\\nand no one is the worse or wiser.\\n\\nIn his lifetime, and likewise in the period of Snagsby\\'s \"time\"\\nof seven long years, there dwelt with Peffer in the same\\nlaw-stationering premises a niece--a short, shrewd niece, something\\ntoo violently compressed about the waist, and with a sharp nose like\\na sharp autumn evening, inclining to be frosty towards the end. The\\nCook\\'s Courtiers had a rumour flying among them that the mother of\\nthis niece did, in her daughter\\'s childhood, moved by too jealous a\\nsolicitude that her figure should approach perfection, lace her\\nup every morning with her maternal foot against the bed-post for\\na stronger hold and purchase; and further, that she exhibited\\ninternally pints of vinegar and lemon-juice, which acids, they held,\\nhad mounted to the nose and temper of the patient. With whichsoever\\nof the many tongues of Rumour this frothy report originated, it\\neither never reached or never influenced the ears of young Snagsby,\\nwho, having wooed and won its fair subject on his arrival at man\\'s\\nestate, entered into two partnerships at once. So now, in Cook\\'s\\nCourt, Cursitor Street, Mr. Snagsby and the niece are one; and the\\nniece still cherishes her figure, which, however tastes may differ,\\nis unquestionably so far precious that there is mighty little of it.\\n\\nMr. and Mrs. Snagsby are not only one bone and one flesh, but, to the\\nneighbours\\' thinking, one voice too. That voice, appearing to proceed\\nfrom Mrs. Snagsby alone, is heard in Cook\\'s Court very often. Mr.\\nSnagsby, otherwise than as he finds expression through these dulcet\\ntones, is rarely heard. He is a mild, bald, timid man with a shining\\nhead and a scrubby clump of black hair sticking out at the back. He\\ntends to meekness and obesity. As he stands at his door in Cook\\'s\\nCourt in his grey shop-coat and black calico sleeves, looking up at\\nthe clouds, or stands behind a desk in his dark shop with a heavy\\nflat ruler, snipping and slicing at sheepskin in company with his two\\n\\'prentices, he is emphatically a retiring and unassuming man. From\\nbeneath his feet, at such times, as from a shrill ghost unquiet in\\nits grave, there frequently arise complainings and lamentations in\\nthe voice already mentioned; and haply, on some occasions when these\\nreach a sharper pitch than usual, Mr. Snagsby mentions to the\\n\\'prentices, \"I think my little woman is a-giving it to Guster!\"\\n\\nThis proper name, so used by Mr. Snagsby, has before now sharpened\\nthe wit of the Cook\\'s Courtiers to remark that it ought to be the\\nname of Mrs. Snagsby, seeing that she might with great force and\\nexpression be termed a Guster, in compliment to her stormy character.\\nIt is, however, the possession, and the only possession except fifty\\nshillings per annum and a very small box indifferently filled with\\nclothing, of a lean young woman from a workhouse (by some supposed to\\nhave been christened Augusta) who, although she was farmed or\\ncontracted for during her growing time by an amiable benefactor of\\nhis species resident at Tooting, and cannot fail to have been\\ndeveloped under the most favourable circumstances, \"has fits,\" which\\nthe parish can\\'t account for.\\n\\nGuster, really aged three or four and twenty, but looking a round ten\\nyears older, goes cheap with this unaccountable drawback of fits, and\\nis so apprehensive of being returned on the hands of her patron saint\\nthat except when she is found with her head in the pail, or the sink,\\nor the copper, or the dinner, or anything else that happens to be\\nnear her at the time of her seizure, she is always at work. She is a\\nsatisfaction to the parents and guardians of the \\'prentices, who feel\\nthat there is little danger of her inspiring tender emotions in the\\nbreast of youth; she is a satisfaction to Mrs. Snagsby, who can\\nalways find fault with her; she is a satisfaction to Mr. Snagsby, who\\nthinks it a charity to keep her. The law-stationer\\'s establishment\\nis, in Guster\\'s eyes, a temple of plenty and splendour. She believes\\nthe little drawing-room upstairs, always kept, as one may say, with\\nits hair in papers and its pinafore on, to be the most elegant\\napartment in Christendom. The view it commands of Cook\\'s Court at one\\nend (not to mention a squint into Cursitor Street) and of Coavinses\\'\\nthe sheriff\\'s officer\\'s backyard at the other she regards as a\\nprospect of unequalled beauty. The portraits it displays in oil--and\\nplenty of it too--of Mr. Snagsby looking at Mrs. Snagsby and of Mrs.\\nSnagsby looking at Mr. Snagsby are in her eyes as achievements of\\nRaphael or Titian. Guster has some recompenses for her many\\nprivations.\\n\\nMr. Snagsby refers everything not in the practical mysteries of the\\nbusiness to Mrs. Snagsby. She manages the money, reproaches the\\ntax-gatherers, appoints the times and places of devotion on Sundays,\\nlicenses Mr. Snagsby\\'s entertainments, and acknowledges no\\nresponsibility as to what she thinks fit to provide for dinner,\\ninsomuch that she is the high standard of comparison among the\\nneighbouring wives a long way down Chancery Lane on both sides, and\\neven out in Holborn, who in any domestic passages of arms habitually\\ncall upon their husbands to look at the difference between their (the\\nwives\\') position and Mrs. Snagsby\\'s, and their (the husbands\\')\\nbehaviour and Mr. Snagsby\\'s. Rumour, always flying bat-like about\\nCook\\'s Court and skimming in and out at everybody\\'s windows, does say\\nthat Mrs. Snagsby is jealous and inquisitive and that Mr. Snagsby is\\nsometimes worried out of house and home, and that if he had the\\nspirit of a mouse he wouldn\\'t stand it. It is even observed that the\\nwives who quote him to their self-willed husbands as a shining\\nexample in reality look down upon him and that nobody does so with\\ngreater superciliousness than one particular lady whose lord is more\\nthan suspected of laying his umbrella on her as an instrument of\\ncorrection. But these vague whisperings may arise from Mr. Snagsby\\'s\\nbeing in his way rather a meditative and poetical man, loving to walk\\nin Staple Inn in the summer-time and to observe how countrified the\\nsparrows and the leaves are, also to lounge about the Rolls Yard of a\\nSunday afternoon and to remark (if in good spirits) that there were\\nold times once and that you\\'d find a stone coffin or two now under\\nthat chapel, he\\'ll be bound, if you was to dig for it. He solaces his\\nimagination, too, by thinking of the many Chancellors and Vices, and\\nMasters of the Rolls who are deceased; and he gets such a flavour of\\nthe country out of telling the two \\'prentices how he HAS heard say\\nthat a brook \"as clear as crystal\" once ran right down the middle of\\nHolborn, when Turnstile really was a turnstile, leading slap away\\ninto the meadows--gets such a flavour of the country out of this that\\nhe never wants to go there.\\n\\nThe day is closing in and the gas is lighted, but is not yet fully\\neffective, for it is not quite dark. Mr. Snagsby standing at his\\nshop-door looking up at the clouds sees a crow who is out late skim\\nwestward over the slice of sky belonging to Cook\\'s Court. The crow\\nflies straight across Chancery Lane and Lincoln\\'s Inn Garden into\\nLincoln\\'s Inn Fields.\\n\\nHere, in a large house, formerly a house of state, lives Mr.\\nTulkinghorn. It is let off in sets of chambers now, and in those\\nshrunken fragments of its greatness, lawyers lie like maggots in\\nnuts. But its roomy staircases, passages, and antechambers still\\nremain; and even its painted ceilings, where Allegory, in Roman\\nhelmet and celestial linen, sprawls among balustrades and pillars,\\nflowers, clouds, and big-legged boys, and makes the head ache--as\\nwould seem to be Allegory\\'s object always, more or less. Here, among\\nhis many boxes labelled with transcendent names, lives Mr.\\nTulkinghorn, when not speechlessly at home in country-houses where\\nthe great ones of the earth are bored to death. Here he is to-day,\\nquiet at his table. An oyster of the old school whom nobody can open.\\n\\nLike as he is to look at, so is his apartment in the dusk of\\nthe present afternoon. Rusty, out of date, withdrawing from\\nattention, able to afford it. Heavy, broad-backed, old-fashioned,\\nmahogany-and-horsehair chairs, not easily lifted; obsolete tables\\nwith spindle-legs and dusty baize covers; presentation prints of the\\nholders of great titles in the last generation or the last but one,\\nenviron him. A thick and dingy Turkey-carpet muffles the floor where\\nhe sits, attended by two candles in old-fashioned silver candlesticks\\nthat give a very insufficient light to his large room. The titles on\\nthe backs of his books have retired into the binding; everything that\\ncan have a lock has got one; no key is visible. Very few loose papers\\nare about. He has some manuscript near him, but is not referring\\nto it. With the round top of an inkstand and two broken bits of\\nsealing-wax he is silently and slowly working out whatever train of\\nindecision is in his mind. Now the inkstand top is in the middle, now\\nthe red bit of sealing-wax, now the black bit. That\\'s not it. Mr.\\nTulkinghorn must gather them all up and begin again.\\n\\nHere, beneath the painted ceiling, with foreshortened Allegory\\nstaring down at his intrusion as if it meant to swoop upon him, and\\nhe cutting it dead, Mr. Tulkinghorn has at once his house and office.\\nHe keeps no staff, only one middle-aged man, usually a little out at\\nelbows, who sits in a high pew in the hall and is rarely overburdened\\nwith business. Mr. Tulkinghorn is not in a common way. He wants no\\nclerks. He is a great reservoir of confidences, not to be so tapped.\\nHis clients want HIM; he is all in all. Drafts that he requires to be\\ndrawn are drawn by special-pleaders in the temple on mysterious\\ninstructions; fair copies that he requires to be made are made at the\\nstationers\\', expense being no consideration. The middle-aged man in\\nthe pew knows scarcely more of the affairs of the peerage than any\\ncrossing-sweeper in Holborn.\\n\\nThe red bit, the black bit, the inkstand top, the other inkstand top,\\nthe little sand-box. So! You to the middle, you to the right, you to\\nthe left. This train of indecision must surely be worked out now or\\nnever. Now! Mr. Tulkinghorn gets up, adjusts his spectacles, puts on\\nhis hat, puts the manuscript in his pocket, goes out, tells the\\nmiddle-aged man out at elbows, \"I shall be back presently.\" Very\\nrarely tells him anything more explicit.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn goes, as the crow came--not quite so straight, but\\nnearly--to Cook\\'s Court, Cursitor Street. To Snagsby\\'s,\\nLaw-Stationer\\'s, Deeds engrossed and copied, Law-Writing executed in\\nall its branches, &c., &c., &c.\\n\\nIt is somewhere about five or six o\\'clock in the afternoon, and a\\nbalmy fragrance of warm tea hovers in Cook\\'s Court. It hovers about\\nSnagsby\\'s door. The hours are early there: dinner at half-past one\\nand supper at half-past nine. Mr. Snagsby was about to descend into\\nthe subterranean regions to take tea when he looked out of his door\\njust now and saw the crow who was out late.\\n\\n\"Master at home?\"\\n\\nGuster is minding the shop, for the \\'prentices take tea in the\\nkitchen with Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby; consequently, the robe-maker\\'s two\\ndaughters, combing their curls at the two glasses in the two\\nsecond-floor windows of the opposite house, are not driving the two\\n\\'prentices to distraction as they fondly suppose, but are merely\\nawakening the unprofitable admiration of Guster, whose hair won\\'t\\ngrow, and never would, and it is confidently thought, never will.\\n\\n\"Master at home?\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\nMaster is at home, and Guster will fetch him. Guster disappears, glad\\nto get out of the shop, which she regards with mingled dread and\\nveneration as a storehouse of awful implements of the great torture\\nof the law--a place not to be entered after the gas is turned off.\\n\\nMr. Snagsby appears, greasy, warm, herbaceous, and chewing. Bolts a\\nbit of bread and butter. Says, \"Bless my soul, sir! Mr. Tulkinghorn!\"\\n\\n\"I want half a word with you, Snagsby.\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, sir! Dear me, sir, why didn\\'t you send your young man\\nround for me? Pray walk into the back shop, sir.\" Snagsby has\\nbrightened in a moment.\\n\\nThe confined room, strong of parchment-grease, is warehouse,\\ncounting-house, and copying-office. Mr. Tulkinghorn sits, facing\\nround, on a stool at the desk.\\n\\n\"Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Snagsby.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir.\" Mr. Snagsby turns up the gas and coughs behind his hand,\\nmodestly anticipating profit. Mr. Snagsby, as a timid man, is\\naccustomed to cough with a variety of expressions, and so to save\\nwords.\\n\\n\"You copied some affidavits in that cause for me lately.\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir, we did.\"\\n\\n\"There was one of them,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, carelessly\\nfeeling--tight, unopenable oyster of the old school!--in the wrong\\ncoat-pocket, \"the handwriting of which is peculiar, and I rather\\nlike. As I happened to be passing, and thought I had it about me, I\\nlooked in to ask you--but I haven\\'t got it. No matter, any other time\\nwill do. Ah! here it is! I looked in to ask you who copied this.\"\\n\\n\"Who copied this, sir?\" says Mr. Snagsby, taking it, laying it flat\\non the desk, and separating all the sheets at once with a twirl and a\\ntwist of the left hand peculiar to lawstationers. \"We gave this out,\\nsir. We were giving out rather a large quantity of work just at that\\ntime. I can tell you in a moment who copied it, sir, by referring to\\nmy book.\"\\n\\nMr. Snagsby takes his book down from the safe, makes another bolt of\\nthe bit of bread and butter which seemed to have stopped short, eyes\\nthe affidavit aside, and brings his right forefinger travelling down\\na page of the book, \"Jewby--Packer--Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Jarndyce! Here we are, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby. \"To be sure! I might\\nhave remembered it. This was given out, sir, to a writer who lodges\\njust over on the opposite side of the lane.\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn has seen the entry, found it before the\\nlaw-stationer, read it while the forefinger was coming down the hill.\\n\\n\"WHAT do you call him? Nemo?\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"Nemo, sir. Here\\nit is. Forty-two folio. Given out on the Wednesday night at eight\\no\\'clock, brought in on the Thursday morning at half after nine.\"\\n\\n\"Nemo!\" repeats Mr. Tulkinghorn. \"Nemo is Latin for no one.\"\\n\\n\"It must be English for some one, sir, I think,\" Mr. Snagsby submits\\nwith his deferential cough. \"It is a person\\'s name. Here it is, you\\nsee, sir! Forty-two folio. Given out Wednesday night, eight o\\'clock;\\nbrought in Thursday morning, half after nine.\"\\n\\nThe tail of Mr. Snagsby\\'s eye becomes conscious of the head of Mrs.\\nSnagsby looking in at the shop-door to know what he means by\\ndeserting his tea. Mr. Snagsby addresses an explanatory cough to Mrs.\\nSnagsby, as who should say, \"My dear, a customer!\"\\n\\n\"Half after nine, sir,\" repeats Mr. Snagsby. \"Our law-writers, who\\nlive by job-work, are a queer lot; and this may not be his name, but\\nit\\'s the name he goes by. I remember now, sir, that he gives it in a\\nwritten advertisement he sticks up down at the Rule Office, and the\\nKing\\'s Bench Office, and the Judges\\' Chambers, and so forth. You know\\nthe kind of document, sir--wanting employ?\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn glances through the little window at the back of\\nCoavinses\\', the sheriff\\'s officer\\'s, where lights shine in Coavinses\\'\\nwindows. Coavinses\\' coffee-room is at the back, and the shadows of\\nseveral gentlemen under a cloud loom cloudily upon the blinds. Mr.\\nSnagsby takes the opportunity of slightly turning his head to glance\\nover his shoulder at his little woman and to make apologetic motions\\nwith his mouth to this effect: \"Tul-king-horn--rich--in-flu-en-tial!\"\\n\\n\"Have you given this man work before?\" asks Mr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear, yes, sir! Work of yours.\"\\n\\n\"Thinking of more important matters, I forget where you said he\\nlived?\"\\n\\n\"Across the lane, sir. In fact, he lodges at a--\" Mr. Snagsby makes\\nanother bolt, as if the bit of bread and butter were insurmountable\\n\"--at a rag and bottle shop.\"\\n\\n\"Can you show me the place as I go back?\"\\n\\n\"With the greatest pleasure, sir!\"\\n\\nMr. Snagsby pulls off his sleeves and his grey coat, pulls on his\\nblack coat, takes his hat from its peg. \"Oh! Here is my little\\nwoman!\" he says aloud. \"My dear, will you be so kind as to tell one\\nof the lads to look after the shop while I step across the lane with\\nMr. Tulkinghorn? Mrs. Snagsby, sir--I shan\\'t be two minutes, my\\nlove!\"\\n\\nMrs. Snagsby bends to the lawyer, retires behind the counter, peeps\\nat them through the window-blind, goes softly into the back office,\\nrefers to the entries in the book still lying open. Is evidently\\ncurious.\\n\\n\"You will find that the place is rough, sir,\" says Mr. Snagsby,\\nwalking deferentially in the road and leaving the narrow pavement to\\nthe lawyer; \"and the party is very rough. But they\\'re a wild lot in\\ngeneral, sir. The advantage of this particular man is that he never\\nwants sleep. He\\'ll go at it right on end if you want him to, as long\\nas ever you like.\"\\n\\nIt is quite dark now, and the gas-lamps have acquired their full\\neffect. Jostling against clerks going to post the day\\'s letters, and\\nagainst counsel and attorneys going home to dinner, and against\\nplaintiffs and defendants and suitors of all sorts, and against the\\ngeneral crowd, in whose way the forensic wisdom of ages has\\ninterposed a million of obstacles to the transaction of the commonest\\nbusiness of life; diving through law and equity, and through that\\nkindred mystery, the street mud, which is made of nobody knows what\\nand collects about us nobody knows whence or how--we only knowing in\\ngeneral that when there is too much of it we find it necessary to\\nshovel it away--the lawyer and the law-stationer come to a rag and\\nbottle shop and general emporium of much disregarded merchandise,\\nlying and being in the shadow of the wall of Lincoln\\'s Inn, and kept,\\nas is announced in paint, to all whom it may concern, by one Krook.\\n\\n\"This is where he lives, sir,\" says the law-stationer.\\n\\n\"This is where he lives, is it?\" says the lawyer unconcernedly.\\n\"Thank you.\"\\n\\n\"Are you not going in, sir?\"\\n\\n\"No, thank you, no; I am going on to the Fields at present. Good\\nevening. Thank you!\" Mr. Snagsby lifts his hat and returns to his\\nlittle woman and his tea.\\n\\nBut Mr. Tulkinghorn does not go on to the Fields at present. He goes\\na short way, turns back, comes again to the shop of Mr. Krook, and\\nenters it straight. It is dim enough, with a blot-headed candle or so\\nin the windows, and an old man and a cat sitting in the back part by\\na fire. The old man rises and comes forward, with another blot-headed\\ncandle in his hand.\\n\\n\"Pray is your lodger within?\"\\n\\n\"Male or female, sir?\" says Mr. Krook.\\n\\n\"Male. The person who does copying.\"\\n\\nMr. Krook has eyed his man narrowly. Knows him by sight. Has an\\nindistinct impression of his aristocratic repute.\\n\\n\"Did you wish to see him, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s what I seldom do myself,\" says Mr. Krook with a grin. \"Shall I\\ncall him down? But it\\'s a weak chance if he\\'d come, sir!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go up to him, then,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"Second floor, sir. Take the candle. Up there!\" Mr. Krook, with his\\ncat beside him, stands at the bottom of the staircase, looking after\\nMr. Tulkinghorn. \"Hi-hi!\" he says when Mr. Tulkinghorn has nearly\\ndisappeared. The lawyer looks down over the hand-rail. The cat\\nexpands her wicked mouth and snarls at him.\\n\\n\"Order, Lady Jane! Behave yourself to visitors, my lady! You know\\nwhat they say of my lodger?\" whispers Krook, going up a step or two.\\n\\n\"What do they say of him?\"\\n\\n\"They say he has sold himself to the enemy, but you and I know\\nbetter--he don\\'t buy. I\\'ll tell you what, though; my lodger is so\\nblack-humoured and gloomy that I believe he\\'d as soon make that\\nbargain as any other. Don\\'t put him out, sir. That\\'s my advice!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn with a nod goes on his way. He comes to the dark door\\non the second floor. He knocks, receives no answer, opens it, and\\naccidentally extinguishes his candle in doing so.\\n\\nThe air of the room is almost bad enough to have extinguished it if\\nhe had not. It is a small room, nearly black with soot, and grease,\\nand dirt. In the rusty skeleton of a grate, pinched at the middle as\\nif poverty had gripped it, a red coke fire burns low. In the corner\\nby the chimney stand a deal table and a broken desk, a wilderness\\nmarked with a rain of ink. In another corner a ragged old portmanteau\\non one of the two chairs serves for cabinet or wardrobe; no larger\\none is needed, for it collapses like the cheeks of a starved man. The\\nfloor is bare, except that one old mat, trodden to shreds of\\nrope-yarn, lies perishing upon the hearth. No curtain veils the\\ndarkness of the night, but the discoloured shutters are drawn\\ntogether, and through the two gaunt holes pierced in them, famine\\nmight be staring in--the banshee of the man upon the bed.\\n\\nFor, on a low bed opposite the fire, a confusion of dirty patchwork,\\nlean-ribbed ticking, and coarse sacking, the lawyer, hesitating just\\nwithin the doorway, sees a man. He lies there, dressed in shirt and\\ntrousers, with bare feet. He has a yellow look in the spectral\\ndarkness of a candle that has guttered down until the whole length of\\nits wick (still burning) has doubled over and left a tower of\\nwinding-sheet above it. His hair is ragged, mingling with his\\nwhiskers and his beard--the latter, ragged too, and grown, like the\\nscum and mist around him, in neglect. Foul and filthy as the room is,\\nfoul and filthy as the air is, it is not easy to perceive what fumes\\nthose are which most oppress the senses in it; but through the\\ngeneral sickliness and faintness, and the odour of stale tobacco,\\nthere comes into the lawyer\\'s mouth the bitter, vapid taste of opium.\\n\\n\"Hallo, my friend!\" he cries, and strikes his iron candlestick\\nagainst the door.\\n\\nHe thinks he has awakened his friend. He lies a little turned away,\\nbut his eyes are surely open.\\n\\n\"Hallo, my friend!\" he cries again. \"Hallo! Hallo!\"\\n\\nAs he rattles on the door, the candle which has drooped so long goes\\nout and leaves him in the dark, with the gaunt eyes in the shutters\\nstaring down upon the bed.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'model_output': \"The chapters introduce the characters and settings of Charles Dickens' novel Bleak House. The story centers around the Jarndyce family and their home called Bleak House. The main characters include the wards Esther Summerson, Ada Clare, and Richard Carstone, who live at Bleak House under the care of their guardian Mr. Jarndyce. Esther and Ada befriend and help the poor brickmaker's starving family. The chapters also describe other notable characters like Mr. Skimpole, Mr. Boythorn, Mr. Guppy, Mrs. Jellyby, Mrs. Pardiggle, Mr. Snagsby, Mr. Tulkinghorn, and Mr. Krook. A key setting is the Court of Chancery where the endless case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce plays out, causing ruin to many involved. The chapters portray Bleak House and detail the routines of its inhabitants. Esther meets and describes the personalities of many characters. She also receives a marriage proposal from Mr. Guppy. The chapters provide an overview of the main characters and settings that Dickens introduces at the start of his novel.\"}, {'summary': 'The scene opens in London on a foggy, smoggy day. The High Court of Chancery is in session, and it appears that the fog has settled thickest on this part of London. This is where the legal suit of Jarndyce and Jarndyce is being argued. A little mad old woman (Miss Flite), and a man from Shropshire (Mr. Gridley) are in attendance. A \"sallow prisoner\" is brought forward. Mr. Tangle, a lawyer, speaks with the Lord High Chancellor, and the matter of the two young wards in Jarndyce is discussed. This matter will come up before the court tomorrow.\\n\\nThe scene changes in Chapter 2 to Chesney Wold, a stately home in Lincolnshire. Here the weather is also bad, but it is constant rain rather than fog. The lady of the manor, Lady Dedlock, is bored to death. She had been in London, and has come back to the country seat before leaving for Paris in a few days.\\n\\nLady Dedlock is introduced to us as a very beautiful middle-aged society lady, her charms undimmed by time. She is exceedingly dignified and self-controlled, but her \"caprices,\" which she tries to hide, are known to her servants and tradesmen. She is the wife of Sir Leicester Dedlock, a baronet, who has married somehat beneath him. It is clear that Lady Dedlock has brought neither an aristocratic lineage or a fortune to the marriage. It is also clear that Sir Leicester has such a great amount of both of those things, and loves her so dearly, that it matters not to him.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn, the family solicitor, has come down to Chesney Wold to discuss the Jarndyce case, in which Lady Dedlock has some slight interest. He is a secretive, enigmatic man, of the most controlled and logical character. He brings many legal papers with him, and Lady Dedlock seems to take an interest in the handwriting on one of them. She asks whose writing it is, but Mr. Tulkinghorn cannot answer her. She becomes faint and must be taken to her room.\\n\\nIn Chapter 3, Esther Summerson\\'s life story is told. She has been materially provided for but emotionally neglected by her \"godmother\" in the town of Windsor. When Esther is about fourteen, her godmother dies, and Esther is sent to Greenleaf school. Through Mr. Kenge, John Jarndyce\\'s solicitor, who comes to see Esther after her godmother\\'s death, she learns her benefactor is Mr. Jarndyce. She has never seen him, but he appears, unbeknownst to her until years later, in the carriage that takes her to Greenleaf school. She is sent there after her godmother\\'s death, and passes six happy years there, being taught by the Misses Donny. Her accounts are paid by her unknown benefactor all the while. When she is older she becomes a teacher of the other girls there, and inspires great affection in her students.\\n\\nWhen she has grown old and educated enough to leave Greenleaf school, she is asked to serve in her benefactor\\'s house, Bleak House. She is brought to Chancery Court to meet Ada Clare and Richard Carstone, two wards in the Jarndyce suit, who are also under the guardianship of Mr. Jarndyce. Esther is meant to be Ada\\'s lady companion.\\n\\nAs they leave the court, they meet Miss Flite, who introduces herself. They learn she is also a suitor in Chancery, and observe that she is poor, eccentric, and perhaps a little mad.\\n\\nIn Chapter 4, the three young people are sent to stay the night at the Jellyby household. Mrs. Jellyby is a philanthropic lady who neglects her large and chaotic household in favor of writing long letters, dictated to her eldest daughter Caddy, about the social conditions in places in Africa. Caddy, an overworked waif, clings to Esther and becomes her friend, as does the youngest neglected child, Peepy. ', 'text': 'London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting\\nin Lincoln\\'s Inn Hall. Implacable November weather. As much mud in\\nthe streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of\\nthe earth, and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus,\\nforty feet long or so, waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn\\nHill. Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots, making a soft black\\ndrizzle, with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown\\nsnowflakes--gone into mourning, one might imagine, for the death of\\nthe sun. Dogs, undistinguishable in mire. Horses, scarcely better;\\nsplashed to their very blinkers. Foot passengers, jostling one\\nanother\\'s umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper, and losing\\ntheir foot-hold at street-corners, where tens of thousands of other\\nfoot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke\\n(if this day ever broke), adding new deposits to the crust upon crust\\nof mud, sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement, and\\naccumulating at compound interest.\\n\\nFog everywhere. Fog up the river, where it flows among green aits and\\nmeadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers\\nof shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city.\\nFog on the Essex marshes, fog on the Kentish heights. Fog creeping\\ninto the cabooses of collier-brigs; fog lying out on the yards and\\nhovering in the rigging of great ships; fog drooping on the gunwales\\nof barges and small boats. Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient\\nGreenwich pensioners, wheezing by the firesides of their wards; fog\\nin the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper,\\ndown in his close cabin; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of\\nhis shivering little \\'prentice boy on deck. Chance people on the\\nbridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog\\nall round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the\\nmisty clouds.\\n\\nGas looming through the fog in divers places in the streets, much as\\nthe sun may, from the spongey fields, be seen to loom by husbandman\\nand ploughboy. Most of the shops lighted two hours before their\\ntime--as the gas seems to know, for it has a haggard and unwilling\\nlook.\\n\\nThe raw afternoon is rawest, and the dense fog is densest, and the\\nmuddy streets are muddiest near that leaden-headed old obstruction,\\nappropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed old\\ncorporation, Temple Bar. And hard by Temple Bar, in Lincoln\\'s Inn\\nHall, at the very heart of the fog, sits the Lord High Chancellor in\\nhis High Court of Chancery.\\n\\nNever can there come fog too thick, never can there come mud and mire\\ntoo deep, to assort with the groping and floundering condition which\\nthis High Court of Chancery, most pestilent of hoary sinners, holds\\nthis day in the sight of heaven and earth.\\n\\nOn such an afternoon, if ever, the Lord High Chancellor ought to be\\nsitting here--as here he is--with a foggy glory round his head,\\nsoftly fenced in with crimson cloth and curtains, addressed by a\\nlarge advocate with great whiskers, a little voice, and an\\ninterminable brief, and outwardly directing his contemplation to the\\nlantern in the roof, where he can see nothing but fog. On such an\\nafternoon some score of members of the High Court of Chancery bar\\nought to be--as here they are--mistily engaged in one of the ten\\nthousand stages of an endless cause, tripping one another up on\\nslippery precedents, groping knee-deep in technicalities, running\\ntheir goat-hair and horsehair warded heads against walls of words and\\nmaking a pretence of equity with serious faces, as players might. On\\nsuch an afternoon the various solicitors in the cause, some two or\\nthree of whom have inherited it from their fathers, who made a\\nfortune by it, ought to be--as are they not?--ranged in a line, in a\\nlong matted well (but you might look in vain for truth at the bottom\\nof it) between the registrar\\'s red table and the silk gowns, with\\nbills, cross-bills, answers, rejoinders, injunctions, affidavits,\\nissues, references to masters, masters\\' reports, mountains of costly\\nnonsense, piled before them. Well may the court be dim, with wasting\\ncandles here and there; well may the fog hang heavy in it, as if it\\nwould never get out; well may the stained-glass windows lose their\\ncolour and admit no light of day into the place; well may the\\nuninitiated from the streets, who peep in through the glass panes in\\nthe door, be deterred from entrance by its owlish aspect and by the\\ndrawl, languidly echoing to the roof from the padded dais where the\\nLord High Chancellor looks into the lantern that has no light in it\\nand where the attendant wigs are all stuck in a fog-bank! This is the\\nCourt of Chancery, which has its decaying houses and its blighted\\nlands in every shire, which has its worn-out lunatic in every\\nmadhouse and its dead in every churchyard, which has its ruined\\nsuitor with his slipshod heels and threadbare dress borrowing and\\nbegging through the round of every man\\'s acquaintance, which gives to\\nmonied might the means abundantly of wearying out the right, which so\\nexhausts finances, patience, courage, hope, so overthrows the brain\\nand breaks the heart, that there is not an honourable man among its\\npractitioners who would not give--who does not often give--the\\nwarning, \"Suffer any wrong that can be done you rather than come\\nhere!\"\\n\\nWho happen to be in the Lord Chancellor\\'s court this murky afternoon\\nbesides the Lord Chancellor, the counsel in the cause, two or three\\ncounsel who are never in any cause, and the well of solicitors before\\nmentioned? There is the registrar below the judge, in wig and gown;\\nand there are two or three maces, or petty-bags, or privy purses, or\\nwhatever they may be, in legal court suits. These are all yawning,\\nfor no crumb of amusement ever falls from Jarndyce and Jarndyce (the\\ncause in hand), which was squeezed dry years upon years ago. The\\nshort-hand writers, the reporters of the court, and the reporters of\\nthe newspapers invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce comes on. Their places are a blank. Standing on\\na seat at the side of the hall, the better to peer into the curtained\\nsanctuary, is a little mad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is\\nalways in court, from its sitting to its rising, and always expecting\\nsome incomprehensible judgment to be given in her favour. Some say\\nshe really is, or was, a party to a suit, but no one knows for\\ncertain because no one cares. She carries some small litter in a\\nreticule which she calls her documents, principally consisting of\\npaper matches and dry lavender. A sallow prisoner has come up, in\\ncustody, for the half-dozenth time to make a personal application \"to\\npurge himself of his contempt,\" which, being a solitary surviving\\nexecutor who has fallen into a state of conglomeration about accounts\\nof which it is not pretended that he had ever any knowledge, he is\\nnot at all likely ever to do. In the meantime his prospects in life\\nare ended. Another ruined suitor, who periodically appears from\\nShropshire and breaks out into efforts to address the Chancellor at\\nthe close of the day\\'s business and who can by no means be made to\\nunderstand that the Chancellor is legally ignorant of his existence\\nafter making it desolate for a quarter of a century, plants himself\\nin a good place and keeps an eye on the judge, ready to call out \"My\\nLord!\" in a voice of sonorous complaint on the instant of his rising.\\nA few lawyers\\' clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger\\non the chance of his furnishing some fun and enlivening the dismal\\nweather a little.\\n\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce drones on. This scarecrow of a suit has, in\\ncourse of time, become so complicated that no man alive knows what it\\nmeans. The parties to it understand it least, but it has been\\nobserved that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five\\nminutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the\\npremises. Innumerable children have been born into the cause;\\ninnumerable young people have married into it; innumerable old people\\nhave died out of it. Scores of persons have deliriously found\\nthemselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without knowing how\\nor why; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the\\nsuit. The little plaintiff or defendant who was promised a new\\nrocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled has grown\\nup, possessed himself of a real horse, and trotted away into the\\nother world. Fair wards of court have faded into mothers and\\ngrandmothers; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone\\nout; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere\\nbills of mortality; there are not three Jarndyces left upon the earth\\nperhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a\\ncoffee-house in Chancery Lane; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags\\nits dreary length before the court, perennially hopeless.\\n\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce has passed into a joke. That is the only good\\nthat has ever come of it. It has been death to many, but it is a joke\\nin the profession. Every master in Chancery has had a reference out\\nof it. Every Chancellor was \"in it,\" for somebody or other, when he\\nwas counsel at the bar. Good things have been said about it by\\nblue-nosed, bulbous-shoed old benchers in select port-wine committee\\nafter dinner in hall. Articled clerks have been in the habit of\\nfleshing their legal wit upon it. The last Lord Chancellor handled it\\nneatly, when, correcting Mr. Blowers, the eminent silk gown who said\\nthat such a thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes, he\\nobserved, \"or when we get through Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mr.\\nBlowers\"--a pleasantry that particularly tickled the maces, bags, and\\npurses.\\n\\nHow many people out of the suit Jarndyce and Jarndyce has stretched\\nforth its unwholesome hand to spoil and corrupt would be a very wide\\nquestion. From the master upon whose impaling files reams of dusty\\nwarrants in Jarndyce and Jarndyce have grimly writhed into many\\nshapes, down to the copying-clerk in the Six Clerks\\' Office who has\\ncopied his tens of thousands of Chancery folio-pages under that\\neternal heading, no man\\'s nature has been made better by it. In\\ntrickery, evasion, procrastination, spoliation, botheration, under\\nfalse pretences of all sorts, there are influences that can never\\ncome to good. The very solicitors\\' boys who have kept the wretched\\nsuitors at bay, by protesting time out of mind that Mr. Chizzle,\\nMizzle, or otherwise was particularly engaged and had appointments\\nuntil dinner, may have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into\\nthemselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce. The receiver in the cause\\nhas acquired a goodly sum of money by it but has acquired too a\\ndistrust of his own mother and a contempt for his own kind. Chizzle,\\nMizzle, and otherwise have lapsed into a habit of vaguely promising\\nthemselves that they will look into that outstanding little matter\\nand see what can be done for Drizzle--who was not well used--when\\nJarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of the office. Shirking and\\nsharking in all their many varieties have been sown broadcast by the\\nill-fated cause; and even those who have contemplated its history\\nfrom the outermost circle of such evil have been insensibly tempted\\ninto a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad\\ncourse, and a loose belief that if the world go wrong it was in some\\noff-hand manner never meant to go right.\\n\\nThus, in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog, sits the\\nLord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery.\\n\\n\"Mr. Tangle,\" says the Lord High Chancellor, latterly something\\nrestless under the eloquence of that learned gentleman.\\n\\n\"Mlud,\" says Mr. Tangle. Mr. Tangle knows more of Jarndyce and\\nJarndyce than anybody. He is famous for it--supposed never to have\\nread anything else since he left school.\\n\\n\"Have you nearly concluded your argument?\"\\n\\n\"Mlud, no--variety of points--feel it my duty tsubmit--ludship,\" is\\nthe reply that slides out of Mr. Tangle.\\n\\n\"Several members of the bar are still to be heard, I believe?\" says\\nthe Chancellor with a slight smile.\\n\\nEighteen of Mr. Tangle\\'s learned friends, each armed with a little\\nsummary of eighteen hundred sheets, bob up like eighteen hammers in a\\npianoforte, make eighteen bows, and drop into their eighteen places\\nof obscurity.\\n\\n\"We will proceed with the hearing on Wednesday fortnight,\" says the\\nChancellor. For the question at issue is only a question of costs, a\\nmere bud on the forest tree of the parent suit, and really will come\\nto a settlement one of these days.\\n\\nThe Chancellor rises; the bar rises; the prisoner is brought forward\\nin a hurry; the man from Shropshire cries, \"My lord!\" Maces, bags,\\nand purses indignantly proclaim silence and frown at the man from\\nShropshire.\\n\\n\"In reference,\" proceeds the Chancellor, still on Jarndyce and\\nJarndyce, \"to the young girl--\"\\n\\n\"Begludship\\'s pardon--boy,\" says Mr. Tangle prematurely. \"In\\nreference,\" proceeds the Chancellor with extra distinctness, \"to the\\nyoung girl and boy, the two young people\"--Mr. Tangle crushed--\"whom\\nI directed to be in attendance to-day and who are now in my private\\nroom, I will see them and satisfy myself as to the expediency of\\nmaking the order for their residing with their uncle.\"\\n\\nMr. Tangle on his legs again. \"Begludship\\'s pardon--dead.\"\\n\\n\"With their\"--Chancellor looking through his double eye-glass at the\\npapers on his desk--\"grandfather.\"\\n\\n\"Begludship\\'s pardon--victim of rash action--brains.\"\\n\\nSuddenly a very little counsel with a terrific bass voice arises,\\nfully inflated, in the back settlements of the fog, and says, \"Will\\nyour lordship allow me? I appear for him. He is a cousin, several\\ntimes removed. I am not at the moment prepared to inform the court in\\nwhat exact remove he is a cousin, but he IS a cousin.\"\\n\\nLeaving this address (delivered like a sepulchral message) ringing in\\nthe rafters of the roof, the very little counsel drops, and the fog\\nknows him no more. Everybody looks for him. Nobody can see him.\\n\\n\"I will speak with both the young people,\" says the Chancellor anew,\\n\"and satisfy myself on the subject of their residing with their\\ncousin. I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I take my\\nseat.\"\\n\\nThe Chancellor is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is\\npresented. Nothing can possibly come of the prisoner\\'s conglomeration\\nbut his being sent back to prison, which is soon done. The man from\\nShropshire ventures another remonstrative \"My lord!\" but the\\nChancellor, being aware of him, has dexterously vanished. Everybody\\nelse quickly vanishes too. A battery of blue bags is loaded with\\nheavy charges of papers and carried off by clerks; the little mad old\\nwoman marches off with her documents; the empty court is locked up.\\nIf all the injustice it has committed and all the misery it has\\ncaused could only be locked up with it, and the whole burnt away in a\\ngreat funeral pyre--why so much the better for other parties than the\\nparties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce!\\n\\n\\n\\nIt is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this same\\nmiry afternoon. It is not so unlike the Court of Chancery but that we\\nmay pass from the one scene to the other, as the crow flies. Both the\\nworld of fashion and the Court of Chancery are things of precedent\\nand usage: oversleeping Rip Van Winkles who have played at strange\\ngames through a deal of thundery weather; sleeping beauties whom the\\nknight will wake one day, when all the stopped spits in the kitchen\\nshall begin to turn prodigiously!\\n\\nIt is not a large world. Relatively even to this world of ours, which\\nhas its limits too (as your Highness shall find when you have made\\nthe tour of it and are come to the brink of the void beyond), it is a\\nvery little speck. There is much good in it; there are many good and\\ntrue people in it; it has its appointed place. But the evil of it is\\nthat it is a world wrapped up in too much jeweller\\'s cotton and fine\\nwool, and cannot hear the rushing of the larger worlds, and cannot\\nsee them as they circle round the sun. It is a deadened world, and\\nits growth is sometimes unhealthy for want of air.\\n\\nMy Lady Dedlock has returned to her house in town for a few days\\nprevious to her departure for Paris, where her ladyship intends to\\nstay some weeks, after which her movements are uncertain. The\\nfashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the Parisians,\\nand it knows all fashionable things. To know things otherwise were to\\nbe unfashionable. My Lady Dedlock has been down at what she calls, in\\nfamiliar conversation, her \"place\" in Lincolnshire. The waters are\\nout in Lincolnshire. An arch of the bridge in the park has been\\nsapped and sopped away. The adjacent low-lying ground for half a mile\\nin breadth is a stagnant river with melancholy trees for islands in\\nit and a surface punctured all over, all day long, with falling rain.\\nMy Lady Dedlock\\'s place has been extremely dreary. The weather for\\nmany a day and night has been so wet that the trees seem wet through,\\nand the soft loppings and prunings of the woodman\\'s axe can make no\\ncrash or crackle as they fall. The deer, looking soaked, leave\\nquagmires where they pass. The shot of a rifle loses its sharpness in\\nthe moist air, and its smoke moves in a tardy little cloud towards\\nthe green rise, coppice-topped, that makes a background for the\\nfalling rain. The view from my Lady Dedlock\\'s own windows is\\nalternately a lead-coloured view and a view in Indian ink. The vases\\non the stone terrace in the foreground catch the rain all day; and\\nthe heavy drops fall--drip, drip, drip--upon the broad flagged\\npavement, called from old time the Ghost\\'s Walk, all night. On\\nSundays the little church in the park is mouldy; the oaken pulpit\\nbreaks out into a cold sweat; and there is a general smell and taste\\nas of the ancient Dedlocks in their graves. My Lady Dedlock (who is\\nchildless), looking out in the early twilight from her boudoir at a\\nkeeper\\'s lodge and seeing the light of a fire upon the latticed\\npanes, and smoke rising from the chimney, and a child, chased by a\\nwoman, running out into the rain to meet the shining figure of a\\nwrapped-up man coming through the gate, has been put quite out of\\ntemper. My Lady Dedlock says she has been \"bored to death.\"\\n\\nTherefore my Lady Dedlock has come away from the place in\\nLincolnshire and has left it to the rain, and the crows, and the\\nrabbits, and the deer, and the partridges and pheasants. The pictures\\nof the Dedlocks past and gone have seemed to vanish into the damp\\nwalls in mere lowness of spirits, as the housekeeper has passed along\\nthe old rooms shutting up the shutters. And when they will next come\\nforth again, the fashionable intelligence--which, like the fiend, is\\nomniscient of the past and present, but not the future--cannot yet\\nundertake to say.\\n\\nSir Leicester Dedlock is only a baronet, but there is no mightier\\nbaronet than he. His family is as old as the hills, and infinitely\\nmore respectable. He has a general opinion that the world might get\\non without hills but would be done up without Dedlocks. He would on\\nthe whole admit nature to be a good idea (a little low, perhaps, when\\nnot enclosed with a park-fence), but an idea dependent for its\\nexecution on your great county families. He is a gentleman of strict\\nconscience, disdainful of all littleness and meanness and ready on\\nthe shortest notice to die any death you may please to mention rather\\nthan give occasion for the least impeachment of his integrity. He is\\nan honourable, obstinate, truthful, high-spirited, intensely\\nprejudiced, perfectly unreasonable man.\\n\\nSir Leicester is twenty years, full measure, older than my Lady. He\\nwill never see sixty-five again, nor perhaps sixty-six, nor yet\\nsixty-seven. He has a twist of the gout now and then and walks a\\nlittle stiffly. He is of a worthy presence, with his light-grey hair\\nand whiskers, his fine shirt-frill, his pure-white waistcoat, and his\\nblue coat with bright buttons always buttoned. He is ceremonious,\\nstately, most polite on every occasion to my Lady, and holds her\\npersonal attractions in the highest estimation. His gallantry to my\\nLady, which has never changed since he courted her, is the one little\\ntouch of romantic fancy in him.\\n\\nIndeed, he married her for love. A whisper still goes about that she\\nhad not even family; howbeit, Sir Leicester had so much family that\\nperhaps he had enough and could dispense with any more. But she had\\nbeauty, pride, ambition, insolent resolve, and sense enough to\\nportion out a legion of fine ladies. Wealth and station, added to\\nthese, soon floated her upward, and for years now my Lady Dedlock has\\nbeen at the centre of the fashionable intelligence and at the top of\\nthe fashionable tree.\\n\\nHow Alexander wept when he had no more worlds to conquer, everybody\\nknows--or has some reason to know by this time, the matter having\\nbeen rather frequently mentioned. My Lady Dedlock, having conquered\\nHER world, fell not into the melting, but rather into the freezing,\\nmood. An exhausted composure, a worn-out placidity, an equanimity of\\nfatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction, are the\\ntrophies of her victory. She is perfectly well-bred. If she could be\\ntranslated to heaven to-morrow, she might be expected to ascend\\nwithout any rapture.\\n\\nShe has beauty still, and if it be not in its heyday, it is not yet\\nin its autumn. She has a fine face--originally of a character that\\nwould be rather called very pretty than handsome, but improved into\\nclassicality by the acquired expression of her fashionable state. Her\\nfigure is elegant and has the effect of being tall. Not that she is\\nso, but that \"the most is made,\" as the Honourable Bob Stables has\\nfrequently asserted upon oath, \"of all her points.\" The same\\nauthority observes that she is perfectly got up and remarks in\\ncommendation of her hair especially that she is the best-groomed\\nwoman in the whole stud.\\n\\nWith all her perfections on her head, my Lady Dedlock has come up\\nfrom her place in Lincolnshire (hotly pursued by the fashionable\\nintelligence) to pass a few days at her house in town previous to her\\ndeparture for Paris, where her ladyship intends to stay some weeks,\\nafter which her movements are uncertain. And at her house in town,\\nupon this muddy, murky afternoon, presents himself an old-fashioned\\nold gentleman, attorney-at-law and eke solicitor of the High Court of\\nChancery, who has the honour of acting as legal adviser of the\\nDedlocks and has as many cast-iron boxes in his office with that name\\noutside as if the present baronet were the coin of the conjuror\\'s\\ntrick and were constantly being juggled through the whole set. Across\\nthe hall, and up the stairs, and along the passages, and through the\\nrooms, which are very brilliant in the season and very dismal out of\\nit--fairy-land to visit, but a desert to live in--the old gentleman\\nis conducted by a Mercury in powder to my Lady\\'s presence.\\n\\nThe old gentleman is rusty to look at, but is reputed to have made\\ngood thrift out of aristocratic marriage settlements and aristocratic\\nwills, and to be very rich. He is surrounded by a mysterious halo of\\nfamily confidences, of which he is known to be the silent depository.\\nThere are noble mausoleums rooted for centuries in retired glades of\\nparks among the growing timber and the fern, which perhaps hold fewer\\nnoble secrets than walk abroad among men, shut up in the breast of\\nMr. Tulkinghorn. He is of what is called the old school--a phrase\\ngenerally meaning any school that seems never to have been young--and\\nwears knee-breeches tied with ribbons, and gaiters or stockings. One\\npeculiarity of his black clothes and of his black stockings, be they\\nsilk or worsted, is that they never shine. Mute, close, irresponsive\\nto any glancing light, his dress is like himself. He never converses\\nwhen not professionally consulted. He is found sometimes, speechless\\nbut quite at home, at corners of dinner-tables in great country\\nhouses and near doors of drawing-rooms, concerning which the\\nfashionable intelligence is eloquent, where everybody knows him and\\nwhere half the Peerage stops to say \"How do you do, Mr. Tulkinghorn?\"\\nHe receives these salutations with gravity and buries them along with\\nthe rest of his knowledge.\\n\\nSir Leicester Dedlock is with my Lady and is happy to see Mr.\\nTulkinghorn. There is an air of prescription about him which is\\nalways agreeable to Sir Leicester; he receives it as a kind of\\ntribute. He likes Mr. Tulkinghorn\\'s dress; there is a kind of tribute\\nin that too. It is eminently respectable, and likewise, in a general\\nway, retainer-like. It expresses, as it were, the steward of the\\nlegal mysteries, the butler of the legal cellar, of the Dedlocks.\\n\\nHas Mr. Tulkinghorn any idea of this himself? It may be so, or it may\\nnot, but there is this remarkable circumstance to be noted in\\neverything associated with my Lady Dedlock as one of a class--as one\\nof the leaders and representatives of her little world. She supposes\\nherself to be an inscrutable Being, quite out of the reach and ken of\\nordinary mortals--seeing herself in her glass, where indeed she looks\\nso. Yet every dim little star revolving about her, from her maid to\\nthe manager of the Italian Opera, knows her weaknesses, prejudices,\\nfollies, haughtinesses, and caprices and lives upon as accurate a\\ncalculation and as nice a measure of her moral nature as her\\ndressmaker takes of her physical proportions. Is a new dress, a new\\ncustom, a new singer, a new dancer, a new form of jewellery, a new\\ndwarf or giant, a new chapel, a new anything, to be set up? There are\\ndeferential people in a dozen callings whom my Lady Dedlock suspects\\nof nothing but prostration before her, who can tell you how to manage\\nher as if she were a baby, who do nothing but nurse her all their\\nlives, who, humbly affecting to follow with profound subservience,\\nlead her and her whole troop after them; who, in hooking one, hook\\nall and bear them off as Lemuel Gulliver bore away the stately fleet\\nof the majestic Lilliput. \"If you want to address our people, sir,\"\\nsay Blaze and Sparkle, the jewellers--meaning by our people Lady\\nDedlock and the rest--\"you must remember that you are not dealing\\nwith the general public; you must hit our people in their weakest\\nplace, and their weakest place is such a place.\" \"To make this\\narticle go down, gentlemen,\" say Sheen and Gloss, the mercers, to\\ntheir friends the manufacturers, \"you must come to us, because we\\nknow where to have the fashionable people, and we can make it\\nfashionable.\" \"If you want to get this print upon the tables of my\\nhigh connexion, sir,\" says Mr. Sladdery, the librarian, \"or if you\\nwant to get this dwarf or giant into the houses of my high connexion,\\nsir, or if you want to secure to this entertainment the patronage of\\nmy high connexion, sir, you must leave it, if you please, to me, for\\nI have been accustomed to study the leaders of my high connexion,\\nsir, and I may tell you without vanity that I can turn them round my\\nfinger\"--in which Mr. Sladdery, who is an honest man, does not\\nexaggerate at all.\\n\\nTherefore, while Mr. Tulkinghorn may not know what is passing in the\\nDedlock mind at present, it is very possible that he may.\\n\\n\"My Lady\\'s cause has been again before the Chancellor, has it, Mr.\\nTulkinghorn?\" says Sir Leicester, giving him his hand.\\n\\n\"Yes. It has been on again to-day,\" Mr. Tulkinghorn replies, making\\none of his quiet bows to my Lady, who is on a sofa near the fire,\\nshading her face with a hand-screen.\\n\\n\"It would be useless to ask,\" says my Lady with the dreariness of the\\nplace in Lincolnshire still upon her, \"whether anything has been\\ndone.\"\\n\\n\"Nothing that YOU would call anything has been done to-day,\" replies\\nMr. Tulkinghorn.\\n\\n\"Nor ever will be,\" says my Lady.\\n\\nSir Leicester has no objection to an interminable Chancery suit. It\\nis a slow, expensive, British, constitutional kind of thing. To be\\nsure, he has not a vital interest in the suit in question, her part\\nin which was the only property my Lady brought him; and he has a\\nshadowy impression that for his name--the name of Dedlock--to be in a\\ncause, and not in the title of that cause, is a most ridiculous\\naccident. But he regards the Court of Chancery, even if it should\\ninvolve an occasional delay of justice and a trifling amount of\\nconfusion, as a something devised in conjunction with a variety of\\nother somethings by the perfection of human wisdom for the eternal\\nsettlement (humanly speaking) of everything. And he is upon the whole\\nof a fixed opinion that to give the sanction of his countenance to\\nany complaints respecting it would be to encourage some person in the\\nlower classes to rise up somewhere--like Wat Tyler.\\n\\n\"As a few fresh affidavits have been put upon the file,\" says Mr.\\nTulkinghorn, \"and as they are short, and as I proceed upon the\\ntroublesome principle of begging leave to possess my clients with any\\nnew proceedings in a cause\"--cautious man Mr. Tulkinghorn, taking no\\nmore responsibility than necessary--\"and further, as I see you are\\ngoing to Paris, I have brought them in my pocket.\"\\n\\n(Sir Leicester was going to Paris too, by the by, but the delight of\\nthe fashionable intelligence was in his Lady.)\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn takes out his papers, asks permission to place them\\non a golden talisman of a table at my Lady\\'s elbow, puts on his\\nspectacles, and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp.\\n\\n\"\\'In Chancery. Between John Jarndyce--\\'\"\\n\\nMy Lady interrupts, requesting him to miss as many of the formal\\nhorrors as he can.\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn glances over his spectacles and begins again lower\\ndown. My Lady carelessly and scornfully abstracts her attention. Sir\\nLeicester in a great chair looks at the file and appears to have a\\nstately liking for the legal repetitions and prolixities as ranging\\namong the national bulwarks. It happens that the fire is hot where my\\nLady sits and that the hand-screen is more beautiful than useful,\\nbeing priceless but small. My Lady, changing her position, sees the\\npapers on the table--looks at them nearer--looks at them nearer\\nstill--asks impulsively, \"Who copied that?\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn stops short, surprised by my Lady\\'s animation and her\\nunusual tone.\\n\\n\"Is it what you people call law-hand?\" she asks, looking full at him\\nin her careless way again and toying with her screen.\\n\\n\"Not quite. Probably\"--Mr. Tulkinghorn examines it as he speaks--\"the\\nlegal character which it has was acquired after the original hand was\\nformed. Why do you ask?\"\\n\\n\"Anything to vary this detestable monotony. Oh, go on, do!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn reads again. The heat is greater; my Lady screens her\\nface. Sir Leicester dozes, starts up suddenly, and cries, \"Eh? What\\ndo you say?\"\\n\\n\"I say I am afraid,\" says Mr. Tulkinghorn, who had risen hastily,\\n\"that Lady Dedlock is ill.\"\\n\\n\"Faint,\" my Lady murmurs with white lips, \"only that; but it is like\\nthe faintness of death. Don\\'t speak to me. Ring, and take me to my\\nroom!\"\\n\\nMr. Tulkinghorn retires into another chamber; bells ring, feet\\nshuffle and patter, silence ensues. Mercury at last begs Mr.\\nTulkinghorn to return.\\n\\n\"Better now,\" quoth Sir Leicester, motioning the lawyer to sit down\\nand read to him alone. \"I have been quite alarmed. I never knew my\\nLady swoon before. But the weather is extremely trying, and she\\nreally has been bored to death down at our place in Lincolnshire.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my portion of\\nthese pages, for I know I am not clever. I always knew that. I can\\nremember, when I was a very little girl indeed, I used to say to my\\ndoll when we were alone together, \"Now, Dolly, I am not clever, you\\nknow very well, and you must be patient with me, like a dear!\" And so\\nshe used to sit propped up in a great arm-chair, with her beautiful\\ncomplexion and rosy lips, staring at me--or not so much at me, I\\nthink, as at nothing--while I busily stitched away and told her every\\none of my secrets.\\n\\nMy dear old doll! I was such a shy little thing that I seldom dared\\nto open my lips, and never dared to open my heart, to anybody else.\\nIt almost makes me cry to think what a relief it used to be to me\\nwhen I came home from school of a day to run upstairs to my room and\\nsay, \"Oh, you dear faithful Dolly, I knew you would be expecting me!\"\\nand then to sit down on the floor, leaning on the elbow of her great\\nchair, and tell her all I had noticed since we parted. I had always\\nrather a noticing way--not a quick way, oh, no!--a silent way of\\nnoticing what passed before me and thinking I should like to\\nunderstand it better. I have not by any means a quick understanding.\\nWhen I love a person very tenderly indeed, it seems to brighten. But\\neven that may be my vanity.\\n\\nI was brought up, from my earliest remembrance--like some of the\\nprincesses in the fairy stories, only I was not charming--by my\\ngodmother. At least, I only knew her as such. She was a good, good\\nwoman! She went to church three times every Sunday, and to morning\\nprayers on Wednesdays and Fridays, and to lectures whenever there\\nwere lectures; and never missed. She was handsome; and if she had\\never smiled, would have been (I used to think) like an angel--but she\\nnever smiled. She was always grave and strict. She was so very good\\nherself, I thought, that the badness of other people made her frown\\nall her life. I felt so different from her, even making every\\nallowance for the differences between a child and a woman; I felt so\\npoor, so trifling, and so far off that I never could be unrestrained\\nwith her--no, could never even love her as I wished. It made me very\\nsorry to consider how good she was and how unworthy of her I was, and\\nI used ardently to hope that I might have a better heart; and I\\ntalked it over very often with the dear old doll, but I never loved\\nmy godmother as I ought to have loved her and as I felt I must have\\nloved her if I had been a better girl.\\n\\nThis made me, I dare say, more timid and retiring than I naturally\\nwas and cast me upon Dolly as the only friend with whom I felt at\\nease. But something happened when I was still quite a little thing\\nthat helped it very much.\\n\\nI had never heard my mama spoken of. I had never heard of my papa\\neither, but I felt more interested about my mama. I had never worn a\\nblack frock, that I could recollect. I had never been shown my mama\\'s\\ngrave. I had never been told where it was. Yet I had never been\\ntaught to pray for any relation but my godmother. I had more than\\nonce approached this subject of my thoughts with Mrs. Rachael, our\\nonly servant, who took my light away when I was in bed (another very\\ngood woman, but austere to me), and she had only said, \"Esther, good\\nnight!\" and gone away and left me.\\n\\nAlthough there were seven girls at the neighbouring school where I\\nwas a day boarder, and although they called me little Esther\\nSummerson, I knew none of them at home. All of them were older than\\nI, to be sure (I was the youngest there by a good deal), but there\\nseemed to be some other separation between us besides that, and\\nbesides their being far more clever than I was and knowing much more\\nthan I did. One of them in the first week of my going to the school\\n(I remember it very well) invited me home to a little party, to my\\ngreat joy. But my godmother wrote a stiff letter declining for me,\\nand I never went. I never went out at all.\\n\\nIt was my birthday. There were holidays at school on other\\nbirthdays--none on mine. There were rejoicings at home on other\\nbirthdays, as I knew from what I heard the girls relate to one\\nanother--there were none on mine. My birthday was the most melancholy\\nday at home in the whole year.\\n\\nI have mentioned that unless my vanity should deceive me (as I know\\nit may, for I may be very vain without suspecting it, though indeed I\\ndon\\'t), my comprehension is quickened when my affection is. My\\ndisposition is very affectionate, and perhaps I might still feel such\\na wound if such a wound could be received more than once with the\\nquickness of that birthday.\\n\\nDinner was over, and my godmother and I were sitting at the table\\nbefore the fire. The clock ticked, the fire clicked; not another\\nsound had been heard in the room or in the house for I don\\'t know how\\nlong. I happened to look timidly up from my stitching, across the\\ntable at my godmother, and I saw in her face, looking gloomily at me,\\n\"It would have been far better, little Esther, that you had had no\\nbirthday, that you had never been born!\"\\n\\nI broke out crying and sobbing, and I said, \"Oh, dear godmother, tell\\nme, pray do tell me, did Mama die on my birthday?\"\\n\\n\"No,\" she returned. \"Ask me no more, child!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, do pray tell me something of her. Do now, at last, dear\\ngodmother, if you please! What did I do to her? How did I lose her?\\nWhy am I so different from other children, and why is it my fault,\\ndear godmother? No, no, no, don\\'t go away. Oh, speak to me!\"\\n\\nI was in a kind of fright beyond my grief, and I caught hold of her\\ndress and was kneeling to her. She had been saying all the while,\\n\"Let me go!\" But now she stood still.\\n\\nHer darkened face had such power over me that it stopped me in the\\nmidst of my vehemence. I put up my trembling little hand to clasp\\nhers or to beg her pardon with what earnestness I might, but withdrew\\nit as she looked at me, and laid it on my fluttering heart. She\\nraised me, sat in her chair, and standing me before her, said slowly\\nin a cold, low voice--I see her knitted brow and pointed\\nfinger--\"Your mother, Esther, is your disgrace, and you were hers.\\nThe time will come--and soon enough--when you will understand this\\nbetter and will feel it too, as no one save a woman can. I have\\nforgiven her\"--but her face did not relent--\"the wrong she did to me,\\nand I say no more of it, though it was greater than you will ever\\nknow--than any one will ever know but I, the sufferer. For yourself,\\nunfortunate girl, orphaned and degraded from the first of these evil\\nanniversaries, pray daily that the sins of others be not visited upon\\nyour head, according to what is written. Forget your mother and leave\\nall other people to forget her who will do her unhappy child that\\ngreatest kindness. Now, go!\"\\n\\nShe checked me, however, as I was about to depart from her--so frozen\\nas I was!--and added this, \"Submission, self-denial, diligent work,\\nare the preparations for a life begun with such a shadow on it. You\\nare different from other children, Esther, because you were not born,\\nlike them, in common sinfulness and wrath. You are set apart.\"\\n\\nI went up to my room, and crept to bed, and laid my doll\\'s cheek\\nagainst mine wet with tears, and holding that solitary friend upon my\\nbosom, cried myself to sleep. Imperfect as my understanding of my\\nsorrow was, I knew that I had brought no joy at any time to anybody\\'s\\nheart and that I was to no one upon earth what Dolly was to me.\\n\\nDear, dear, to think how much time we passed alone together\\nafterwards, and how often I repeated to the doll the story of my\\nbirthday and confided to her that I would try as hard as ever I could\\nto repair the fault I had been born with (of which I confessedly felt\\nguilty and yet innocent) and would strive as I grew up to be\\nindustrious, contented, and kind-hearted and to do some good to some\\none, and win some love to myself if I could. I hope it is not\\nself-indulgent to shed these tears as I think of it. I am very\\nthankful, I am very cheerful, but I cannot quite help their coming to\\nmy eyes.\\n\\nThere! I have wiped them away now and can go on again properly.\\n\\nI felt the distance between my godmother and myself so much more\\nafter the birthday, and felt so sensible of filling a place in her\\nhouse which ought to have been empty, that I found her more difficult\\nof approach, though I was fervently grateful to her in my heart, than\\never. I felt in the same way towards my school companions; I felt in\\nthe same way towards Mrs. Rachael, who was a widow; and oh, towards\\nher daughter, of whom she was proud, who came to see her once a\\nfortnight! I was very retired and quiet, and tried to be very\\ndiligent.\\n\\nOne sunny afternoon when I had come home from school with my books\\nand portfolio, watching my long shadow at my side, and as I was\\ngliding upstairs to my room as usual, my godmother looked out of the\\nparlour-door and called me back. Sitting with her, I found--which was\\nvery unusual indeed--a stranger. A portly, important-looking\\ngentleman, dressed all in black, with a white cravat, large gold\\nwatch seals, a pair of gold eye-glasses, and a large seal-ring upon\\nhis little finger.\\n\\n\"This,\" said my godmother in an undertone, \"is the child.\" Then she\\nsaid in her naturally stern way of speaking, \"This is Esther, sir.\"\\n\\nThe gentleman put up his eye-glasses to look at me and said, \"Come\\nhere, my dear!\" He shook hands with me and asked me to take off my\\nbonnet, looking at me all the while. When I had complied, he said,\\n\"Ah!\" and afterwards \"Yes!\" And then, taking off his eye-glasses and\\nfolding them in a red case, and leaning back in his arm-chair,\\nturning the case about in his two hands, he gave my godmother a nod.\\nUpon that, my godmother said, \"You may go upstairs, Esther!\" And I\\nmade him my curtsy and left him.\\n\\nIt must have been two years afterwards, and I was almost fourteen,\\nwhen one dreadful night my godmother and I sat at the fireside. I was\\nreading aloud, and she was listening. I had come down at nine o\\'clock\\nas I always did to read the Bible to her, and was reading from St.\\nJohn how our Saviour stooped down, writing with his finger in the\\ndust, when they brought the sinful woman to him.\\n\\n\"So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself and said\\nunto them, \\'He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a\\nstone at her!\\'\"\\n\\nI was stopped by my godmother\\'s rising, putting her hand to her head,\\nand crying out in an awful voice from quite another part of the book,\\n\"\\'Watch ye, therefore, lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping. And\\nwhat I say unto you, I say unto all, Watch!\\'\"\\n\\nIn an instant, while she stood before me repeating these words, she\\nfell down on the floor. I had no need to cry out; her voice had\\nsounded through the house and been heard in the street.\\n\\nShe was laid upon her bed. For more than a week she lay there, little\\naltered outwardly, with her old handsome resolute frown that I so\\nwell knew carved upon her face. Many and many a time, in the day and\\nin the night, with my head upon the pillow by her that my whispers\\nmight be plainer to her, I kissed her, thanked her, prayed for her,\\nasked her for her blessing and forgiveness, entreated her to give me\\nthe least sign that she knew or heard me. No, no, no. Her face was\\nimmovable. To the very last, and even afterwards, her frown remained\\nunsoftened.\\n\\nOn the day after my poor good godmother was buried, the gentleman in\\nblack with the white neckcloth reappeared. I was sent for by Mrs.\\nRachael, and found him in the same place, as if he had never gone\\naway.\\n\\n\"My name is Kenge,\" he said; \"you may remember it, my child; Kenge\\nand Carboy, Lincoln\\'s Inn.\"\\n\\nI replied that I remembered to have seen him once before.\\n\\n\"Pray be seated--here near me. Don\\'t distress yourself; it\\'s of no\\nuse. Mrs. Rachael, I needn\\'t inform you who were acquainted with the\\nlate Miss Barbary\\'s affairs, that her means die with her and that\\nthis young lady, now her aunt is dead--\"\\n\\n\"My aunt, sir!\"\\n\\n\"It is really of no use carrying on a deception when no object is to\\nbe gained by it,\" said Mr. Kenge smoothly, \"Aunt in fact, though not\\nin law. Don\\'t distress yourself! Don\\'t weep! Don\\'t tremble! Mrs.\\nRachael, our young friend has no doubt heard of--the--a--Jarndyce and\\nJarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Never,\" said Mrs. Rachael.\\n\\n\"Is it possible,\" pursued Mr. Kenge, putting up his eye-glasses,\\n\"that our young friend--I BEG you won\\'t distress yourself!--never\\nheard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce!\"\\n\\nI shook my head, wondering even what it was.\\n\\n\"Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce?\" said Mr. Kenge, looking over his\\nglasses at me and softly turning the case about and about as if he\\nwere petting something. \"Not of one of the greatest Chancery suits\\nknown? Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce--the--a--in itself a monument of\\nChancery practice. In which (I would say) every difficulty, every\\ncontingency, every masterly fiction, every form of procedure known\\nin that court, is represented over and over again? It is a cause\\nthat could not exist out of this free and great country. I should\\nsay that the aggregate of costs in Jarndyce and Jarndyce, Mrs.\\nRachael\"--I was afraid he addressed himself to her because I appeared\\ninattentive\"--amounts at the present hour to from SIX-ty to SEVEN-ty\\nTHOUSAND POUNDS!\" said Mr. Kenge, leaning back in his chair.\\n\\nI felt very ignorant, but what could I do? I was so entirely\\nunacquainted with the subject that I understood nothing about it even\\nthen.\\n\\n\"And she really never heard of the cause!\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\"Surprising!\"\\n\\n\"Miss Barbary, sir,\" returned Mrs. Rachael, \"who is now among the\\nSeraphim--\"\\n\\n\"I hope so, I am sure,\" said Mr. Kenge politely.\\n\\n\"--Wished Esther only to know what would be serviceable to her. And\\nshe knows, from any teaching she has had here, nothing more.\"\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Mr. Kenge. \"Upon the whole, very proper. Now to the\\npoint,\" addressing me. \"Miss Barbary, your sole relation (in fact\\nthat is, for I am bound to observe that in law you had none) being\\ndeceased and it naturally not being to be expected that Mrs.\\nRachael--\"\\n\\n\"Oh, dear no!\" said Mrs. Rachael quickly.\\n\\n\"Quite so,\" assented Mr. Kenge; \"--that Mrs. Rachael should charge\\nherself with your maintenance and support (I beg you won\\'t distress\\nyourself), you are in a position to receive the renewal of an offer\\nwhich I was instructed to make to Miss Barbary some two years ago and\\nwhich, though rejected then, was understood to be renewable under the\\nlamentable circumstances that have since occurred. Now, if I avow\\nthat I represent, in Jarndyce and Jarndyce and otherwise, a highly\\nhumane, but at the same time singular, man, shall I compromise myself\\nby any stretch of my professional caution?\" said Mr. Kenge, leaning\\nback in his chair again and looking calmly at us both.\\n\\nHe appeared to enjoy beyond everything the sound of his own voice. I\\ncouldn\\'t wonder at that, for it was mellow and full and gave great\\nimportance to every word he uttered. He listened to himself with\\nobvious satisfaction and sometimes gently beat time to his own music\\nwith his head or rounded a sentence with his hand. I was very much\\nimpressed by him--even then, before I knew that he formed himself on\\nthe model of a great lord who was his client and that he was\\ngenerally called Conversation Kenge.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he pursued, \"being aware of the--I would say,\\ndesolate--position of our young friend, offers to place her at a\\nfirst-rate establishment where her education shall be completed,\\nwhere her comfort shall be secured, where her reasonable wants shall\\nbe anticipated, where she shall be eminently qualified to discharge\\nher duty in that station of life unto which it has pleased--shall I\\nsay Providence?--to call her.\"\\n\\nMy heart was filled so full, both by what he said and by his\\naffecting manner of saying it, that I was not able to speak, though I\\ntried.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce,\" he went on, \"makes no condition beyond expressing his\\nexpectation that our young friend will not at any time remove herself\\nfrom the establishment in question without his knowledge and\\nconcurrence. That she will faithfully apply herself to the\\nacquisition of those accomplishments, upon the exercise of which she\\nwill be ultimately dependent. That she will tread in the paths of\\nvirtue and honour, and--the--a--so forth.\"\\n\\nI was still less able to speak than before.\\n\\n\"Now, what does our young friend say?\" proceeded Mr. Kenge. \"Take\\ntime, take time! I pause for her reply. But take time!\"\\n\\nWhat the destitute subject of such an offer tried to say, I need not\\nrepeat. What she did say, I could more easily tell, if it were worth\\nthe telling. What she felt, and will feel to her dying hour, I could\\nnever relate.\\n\\nThis interview took place at Windsor, where I had passed (as far as I\\nknew) my whole life. On that day week, amply provided with all\\nnecessaries, I left it, inside the stagecoach, for Reading.\\n\\nMrs. Rachael was too good to feel any emotion at parting, but I was\\nnot so good, and wept bitterly. I thought that I ought to have known\\nher better after so many years and ought to have made myself enough\\nof a favourite with her to make her sorry then. When she gave me one\\ncold parting kiss upon my forehead, like a thaw-drop from the stone\\nporch--it was a very frosty day--I felt so miserable and\\nself-reproachful that I clung to her and told her it was my fault, I\\nknew, that she could say good-bye so easily!\\n\\n\"No, Esther!\" she returned. \"It is your misfortune!\"\\n\\nThe coach was at the little lawn-gate--we had not come out until we\\nheard the wheels--and thus I left her, with a sorrowful heart. She\\nwent in before my boxes were lifted to the coach-roof and shut the\\ndoor. As long as I could see the house, I looked back at it from the\\nwindow through my tears. My godmother had left Mrs. Rachael all the\\nlittle property she possessed; and there was to be a sale; and an old\\nhearth-rug with roses on it, which always seemed to me the first\\nthing in the world I had ever seen, was hanging outside in the frost\\nand snow. A day or two before, I had wrapped the dear old doll in her\\nown shawl and quietly laid her--I am half ashamed to tell it--in the\\ngarden-earth under the tree that shaded my old window. I had no\\ncompanion left but my bird, and him I carried with me in his cage.\\n\\nWhen the house was out of sight, I sat, with my bird-cage in the\\nstraw at my feet, forward on the low seat to look out of the high\\nwindow, watching the frosty trees, that were like beautiful pieces of\\nspar, and the fields all smooth and white with last night\\'s snow, and\\nthe sun, so red but yielding so little heat, and the ice, dark like\\nmetal where the skaters and sliders had brushed the snow away. There\\nwas a gentleman in the coach who sat on the opposite seat and looked\\nvery large in a quantity of wrappings, but he sat gazing out of the\\nother window and took no notice of me.\\n\\nI thought of my dead godmother, of the night when I read to her, of\\nher frowning so fixedly and sternly in her bed, of the strange place\\nI was going to, of the people I should find there, and what they\\nwould be like, and what they would say to me, when a voice in the\\ncoach gave me a terrible start.\\n\\nIt said, \"What the de-vil are you crying for?\"\\n\\nI was so frightened that I lost my voice and could only answer in a\\nwhisper, \"Me, sir?\" For of course I knew it must have been the\\ngentleman in the quantity of wrappings, though he was still looking\\nout of his window.\\n\\n\"Yes, you,\" he said, turning round.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t know I was crying, sir,\" I faltered.\\n\\n\"But you are!\" said the gentleman. \"Look here!\" He came quite\\nopposite to me from the other corner of the coach, brushed one of his\\nlarge furry cuffs across my eyes (but without hurting me), and showed\\nme that it was wet.\\n\\n\"There! Now you know you are,\" he said. \"Don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sir,\" I said.\\n\\n\"And what are you crying for?\" said the gentleman, \"Don\\'t you want to\\ngo there?\"\\n\\n\"Where, sir?\"\\n\\n\"Where? Why, wherever you are going,\" said the gentleman.\\n\\n\"I am very glad to go there, sir,\" I answered.\\n\\n\"Well, then! Look glad!\" said the gentleman.\\n\\nI thought he was very strange, or at least that what I could see of\\nhim was very strange, for he was wrapped up to the chin, and his face\\nwas almost hidden in a fur cap with broad fur straps at the side of\\nhis head fastened under his chin; but I was composed again, and not\\nafraid of him. So I told him that I thought I must have been crying\\nbecause of my godmother\\'s death and because of Mrs. Rachael\\'s not\\nbeing sorry to part with me.\\n\\n\"Confound Mrs. Rachael!\" said the gentleman. \"Let her fly away in a\\nhigh wind on a broomstick!\"\\n\\nI began to be really afraid of him now and looked at him with the\\ngreatest astonishment. But I thought that he had pleasant eyes,\\nalthough he kept on muttering to himself in an angry manner and\\ncalling Mrs. Rachael names.\\n\\nAfter a little while he opened his outer wrapper, which appeared to\\nme large enough to wrap up the whole coach, and put his arm down into\\na deep pocket in the side.\\n\\n\"Now, look here!\" he said. \"In this paper,\" which was nicely folded,\\n\"is a piece of the best plum-cake that can be got for money--sugar on\\nthe outside an inch thick, like fat on mutton chops. Here\\'s a little\\npie (a gem this is, both for size and quality), made in France. And\\nwhat do you suppose it\\'s made of? Livers of fat geese. There\\'s a pie!\\nNow let\\'s see you eat \\'em.\"\\n\\n\"Thank you, sir,\" I replied; \"thank you very much indeed, but I hope\\nyou won\\'t be offended--they are too rich for me.\"\\n\\n\"Floored again!\" said the gentleman, which I didn\\'t at all\\nunderstand, and threw them both out of window.\\n\\nHe did not speak to me any more until he got out of the coach a\\nlittle way short of Reading, when he advised me to be a good girl and\\nto be studious, and shook hands with me. I must say I was relieved by\\nhis departure. We left him at a milestone. I often walked past it\\nafterwards, and never for a long time without thinking of him and\\nhalf expecting to meet him. But I never did; and so, as time went on,\\nhe passed out of my mind.\\n\\nWhen the coach stopped, a very neat lady looked up at the window and\\nsaid, \"Miss Donny.\"\\n\\n\"No, ma\\'am, Esther Summerson.\"\\n\\n\"That is quite right,\" said the lady, \"Miss Donny.\"\\n\\nI now understood that she introduced herself by that name, and begged\\nMiss Donny\\'s pardon for my mistake, and pointed out my boxes at her\\nrequest. Under the direction of a very neat maid, they were put\\noutside a very small green carriage; and then Miss Donny, the maid,\\nand I got inside and were driven away.\\n\\n\"Everything is ready for you, Esther,\" said Miss Donny, \"and the\\nscheme of your pursuits has been arranged in exact accordance with\\nthe wishes of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce.\"\\n\\n\"Of--did you say, ma\\'am?\"\\n\\n\"Of your guardian, Mr. Jarndyce,\" said Miss Donny.\\n\\nI was so bewildered that Miss Donny thought the cold had been too\\nsevere for me and lent me her smelling-bottle.\\n\\n\"Do you know my--guardian, Mr. Jarndyce, ma\\'am?\" I asked after a good\\ndeal of hesitation.\\n\\n\"Not personally, Esther,\" said Miss Donny; \"merely through his\\nsolicitors, Messrs. Kenge and Carboy, of London. A very superior\\ngentleman, Mr. Kenge. Truly eloquent indeed. Some of his periods\\nquite majestic!\"\\n\\nI felt this to be very true but was too confused to attend to it. Our\\nspeedy arrival at our destination, before I had time to recover\\nmyself, increased my confusion, and I never shall forget the\\nuncertain and the unreal air of everything at Greenleaf (Miss Donny\\'s\\nhouse) that afternoon!\\n\\nBut I soon became used to it. I was so adapted to the routine of\\nGreenleaf before long that I seemed to have been there a great while\\nand almost to have dreamed rather than really lived my old life at my\\ngodmother\\'s. Nothing could be more precise, exact, and orderly than\\nGreenleaf. There was a time for everything all round the dial of the\\nclock, and everything was done at its appointed moment.\\n\\nWe were twelve boarders, and there were two Miss Donnys, twins. It\\nwas understood that I would have to depend, by and by, on my\\nqualifications as a governess, and I was not only instructed in\\neverything that was taught at Greenleaf, but was very soon engaged in\\nhelping to instruct others. Although I was treated in every other\\nrespect like the rest of the school, this single difference was made\\nin my case from the first. As I began to know more, I taught more,\\nand so in course of time I had plenty to do, which I was very fond of\\ndoing because it made the dear girls fond of me. At last, whenever a\\nnew pupil came who was a little downcast and unhappy, she was so\\nsure--indeed I don\\'t know why--to make a friend of me that all\\nnew-comers were confided to my care. They said I was so gentle, but I\\nam sure THEY were! I often thought of the resolution I had made on my\\nbirthday to try to be industrious, contented, and true-hearted and to\\ndo some good to some one and win some love if I could; and indeed,\\nindeed, I felt almost ashamed to have done so little and have won so\\nmuch.\\n\\nI passed at Greenleaf six happy, quiet years. I never saw in any face\\nthere, thank heaven, on my birthday, that it would have been better\\nif I had never been born. When the day came round, it brought me so\\nmany tokens of affectionate remembrance that my room was beautiful\\nwith them from New Year\\'s Day to Christmas.\\n\\nIn those six years I had never been away except on visits at holiday\\ntime in the neighbourhood. After the first six months or so I had\\ntaken Miss Donny\\'s advice in reference to the propriety of writing to\\nMr. Kenge to say that I was happy and grateful, and with her approval\\nI had written such a letter. I had received a formal answer\\nacknowledging its receipt and saying, \"We note the contents thereof,\\nwhich shall be duly communicated to our client.\" After that I\\nsometimes heard Miss Donny and her sister mention how regular my\\naccounts were paid, and about twice a year I ventured to write a\\nsimilar letter. I always received by return of post exactly the same\\nanswer in the same round hand, with the signature of Kenge and Carboy\\nin another writing, which I supposed to be Mr. Kenge\\'s.\\n\\nIt seems so curious to me to be obliged to write all this about\\nmyself! As if this narrative were the narrative of MY life! But my\\nlittle body will soon fall into the background now.\\n\\nSix quiet years (I find I am saying it for the second time) I had\\npassed at Greenleaf, seeing in those around me, as it might be in a\\nlooking-glass, every stage of my own growth and change there, when,\\none November morning, I received this letter. I omit the date.\\n\\n\\n   Old Square, Lincoln\\'s Inn\\n\\n   Madam,\\n\\n   Jarndyce and Jarndyce\\n\\n   Our clt Mr. Jarndyce being abt to rece into his house,\\n   under an Order of the Ct of Chy, a Ward of the Ct in this\\n   cause, for whom he wishes to secure an elgble compn,\\n   directs us to inform you that he will be glad of your\\n   serces in the afsd capacity.\\n\\n   We have arrngd for your being forded, carriage free, pr\\n   eight o\\'clock coach from Reading, on Monday morning next,\\n   to White Horse Cellar, Piccadilly, London, where one of\\n   our clks will be in waiting to convey you to our offe as\\n   above.\\n\\n   We are, Madam, Your obedt Servts,\\n\\n   Kenge and Carboy\\n\\n   Miss Esther Summerson\\n\\n\\nOh, never, never, never shall I forget the emotion this letter caused\\nin the house! It was so tender in them to care so much for me, it was\\nso gracious in that father who had not forgotten me to have made my\\norphan way so smooth and easy and to have inclined so many youthful\\nnatures towards me, that I could hardly bear it. Not that I would\\nhave had them less sorry--I am afraid not; but the pleasure of it,\\nand the pain of it, and the pride and joy of it, and the humble\\nregret of it were so blended that my heart seemed almost breaking\\nwhile it was full of rapture.\\n\\nThe letter gave me only five days\\' notice of my removal. When every\\nminute added to the proofs of love and kindness that were given me in\\nthose five days, and when at last the morning came and when they took\\nme through all the rooms that I might see them for the last time, and\\nwhen some cried, \"Esther, dear, say good-bye to me here at my\\nbedside, where you first spoke so kindly to me!\" and when others\\nasked me only to write their names, \"With Esther\\'s love,\" and when\\nthey all surrounded me with their parting presents and clung to me\\nweeping and cried, \"What shall we do when dear, dear Esther\\'s gone!\"\\nand when I tried to tell them how forbearing and how good they had\\nall been to me and how I blessed and thanked them every one, what a\\nheart I had!\\n\\nAnd when the two Miss Donnys grieved as much to part with me as the\\nleast among them, and when the maids said, \"Bless you, miss, wherever\\nyou go!\" and when the ugly lame old gardener, who I thought had\\nhardly noticed me in all those years, came panting after the coach to\\ngive me a little nosegay of geraniums and told me I had been the\\nlight of his eyes--indeed the old man said so!--what a heart I had\\nthen!\\n\\nAnd could I help it if with all this, and the coming to the little\\nschool, and the unexpected sight of the poor children outside waving\\ntheir hats and bonnets to me, and of a grey-haired gentleman and lady\\nwhose daughter I had helped to teach and at whose house I had visited\\n(who were said to be the proudest people in all that country), caring\\nfor nothing but calling out, \"Good-bye, Esther. May you be very\\nhappy!\"--could I help it if I was quite bowed down in the coach by\\nmyself and said \"Oh, I am so thankful, I am so thankful!\" many times\\nover!\\n\\nBut of course I soon considered that I must not take tears where I\\nwas going after all that had been done for me. Therefore, of course,\\nI made myself sob less and persuaded myself to be quiet by saying\\nvery often, \"Esther, now you really must! This WILL NOT do!\" I\\ncheered myself up pretty well at last, though I am afraid I was\\nlonger about it than I ought to have been; and when I had cooled my\\neyes with lavender water, it was time to watch for London.\\n\\nI was quite persuaded that we were there when we were ten miles off,\\nand when we really were there, that we should never get there.\\nHowever, when we began to jolt upon a stone pavement, and\\nparticularly when every other conveyance seemed to be running into\\nus, and we seemed to be running into every other conveyance, I began\\nto believe that we really were approaching the end of our journey.\\nVery soon afterwards we stopped.\\n\\nA young gentleman who had inked himself by accident addressed me from\\nthe pavement and said, \"I am from Kenge and Carboy\\'s, miss, of\\nLincoln\\'s Inn.\"\\n\\n\"If you please, sir,\" said I.\\n\\nHe was very obliging, and as he handed me into a fly after\\nsuperintending the removal of my boxes, I asked him whether there was\\na great fire anywhere? For the streets were so full of dense brown\\nsmoke that scarcely anything was to be seen.\\n\\n\"Oh, dear no, miss,\" he said. \"This is a London particular.\"\\n\\nI had never heard of such a thing.\\n\\n\"A fog, miss,\" said the young gentleman.\\n\\n\"Oh, indeed!\" said I.\\n\\nWe drove slowly through the dirtiest and darkest streets that ever\\nwere seen in the world (I thought) and in such a distracting state of\\nconfusion that I wondered how the people kept their senses, until we\\npassed into sudden quietude under an old gateway and drove on through\\na silent square until we came to an odd nook in a corner, where there\\nwas an entrance up a steep, broad flight of stairs, like an entrance\\nto a church. And there really was a churchyard outside under some\\ncloisters, for I saw the gravestones from the staircase window.\\n\\nThis was Kenge and Carboy\\'s. The young gentleman showed me through an\\nouter office into Mr. Kenge\\'s room--there was no one in it--and\\npolitely put an arm-chair for me by the fire. He then called my\\nattention to a little looking-glass hanging from a nail on one side\\nof the chimney-piece.\\n\\n\"In case you should wish to look at yourself, miss, after the\\njourney, as you\\'re going before the Chancellor. Not that it\\'s\\nrequisite, I am sure,\" said the young gentleman civilly.\\n\\n\"Going before the Chancellor?\" I said, startled for a moment.\\n\\n\"Only a matter of form, miss,\" returned the young gentleman. \"Mr.\\nKenge is in court now. He left his compliments, and would you partake\\nof some refreshment\"--there were biscuits and a decanter of wine on a\\nsmall table--\"and look over the paper,\" which the young gentleman\\ngave me as he spoke. He then stirred the fire and left me.\\n\\nEverything was so strange--the stranger from its being night in the\\nday-time, the candles burning with a white flame, and looking raw and\\ncold--that I read the words in the newspaper without knowing what\\nthey meant and found myself reading the same words repeatedly. As it\\nwas of no use going on in that way, I put the paper down, took a peep\\nat my bonnet in the glass to see if it was neat, and looked at the\\nroom, which was not half lighted, and at the shabby, dusty tables,\\nand at the piles of writings, and at a bookcase full of the most\\ninexpressive-looking books that ever had anything to say for\\nthemselves. Then I went on, thinking, thinking, thinking; and the\\nfire went on, burning, burning, burning; and the candles went on\\nflickering and guttering, and there were no snuffers--until the young\\ngentleman by and by brought a very dirty pair--for two hours.\\n\\nAt last Mr. Kenge came. HE was not altered, but he was surprised to\\nsee how altered I was and appeared quite pleased. \"As you are going\\nto be the companion of the young lady who is now in the Chancellor\\'s\\nprivate room, Miss Summerson,\" he said, \"we thought it well that you\\nshould be in attendance also. You will not be discomposed by the Lord\\nChancellor, I dare say?\"\\n\\n\"No, sir,\" I said, \"I don\\'t think I shall,\" really not seeing on\\nconsideration why I should be.\\n\\nSo Mr. Kenge gave me his arm and we went round the corner, under a\\ncolonnade, and in at a side door. And so we came, along a passage,\\ninto a comfortable sort of room where a young lady and a young\\ngentleman were standing near a great, loud-roaring fire. A screen was\\ninterposed between them and it, and they were leaning on the screen,\\ntalking.\\n\\nThey both looked up when I came in, and I saw in the young lady, with\\nthe fire shining upon her, such a beautiful girl! With such rich\\ngolden hair, such soft blue eyes, and such a bright, innocent,\\ntrusting face!\\n\\n\"Miss Ada,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"this is Miss Summerson.\"\\n\\nShe came to meet me with a smile of welcome and her hand extended,\\nbut seemed to change her mind in a moment and kissed me. In short,\\nshe had such a natural, captivating, winning manner that in a few\\nminutes we were sitting in the window-seat, with the light of the\\nfire upon us, talking together as free and happy as could be.\\n\\nWhat a load off my mind! It was so delightful to know that she could\\nconfide in me and like me! It was so good of her, and so encouraging\\nto me!\\n\\nThe young gentleman was her distant cousin, she told me, and his name\\nRichard Carstone. He was a handsome youth with an ingenuous face and\\na most engaging laugh; and after she had called him up to where we\\nsat, he stood by us, in the light of the fire, talking gaily, like a\\nlight-hearted boy. He was very young, not more than nineteen then, if\\nquite so much, but nearly two years older than she was. They were\\nboth orphans and (what was very unexpected and curious to me) had\\nnever met before that day. Our all three coming together for the\\nfirst time in such an unusual place was a thing to talk about, and we\\ntalked about it; and the fire, which had left off roaring, winked its\\nred eyes at us--as Richard said--like a drowsy old Chancery lion.\\n\\nWe conversed in a low tone because a full-dressed gentleman in a bag\\nwig frequently came in and out, and when he did so, we could hear a\\ndrawling sound in the distance, which he said was one of the counsel\\nin our case addressing the Lord Chancellor. He told Mr. Kenge that\\nthe Chancellor would be up in five minutes; and presently we heard a\\nbustle and a tread of feet, and Mr. Kenge said that the Court had\\nrisen and his lordship was in the next room.\\n\\nThe gentleman in the bag wig opened the door almost directly and\\nrequested Mr. Kenge to come in. Upon that, we all went into the next\\nroom, Mr. Kenge first, with my darling--it is so natural to me now\\nthat I can\\'t help writing it; and there, plainly dressed in black and\\nsitting in an arm-chair at a table near the fire, was his lordship,\\nwhose robe, trimmed with beautiful gold lace, was thrown upon another\\nchair. He gave us a searching look as we entered, but his manner was\\nboth courtly and kind.\\n\\nThe gentleman in the bag wig laid bundles of papers on his lordship\\'s\\ntable, and his lordship silently selected one and turned over the\\nleaves.\\n\\n\"Miss Clare,\" said the Lord Chancellor. \"Miss Ada Clare?\"\\n\\nMr. Kenge presented her, and his lordship begged her to sit down near\\nhim. That he admired her and was interested by her even I could see\\nin a moment. It touched me that the home of such a beautiful young\\ncreature should be represented by that dry, official place. The Lord\\nHigh Chancellor, at his best, appeared so poor a substitute for the\\nlove and pride of parents.\\n\\n\"The Jarndyce in question,\" said the Lord Chancellor, still turning\\nover leaves, \"is Jarndyce of Bleak House.\"\\n\\n\"Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\\n\"A dreary name,\" said the Lord Chancellor.\\n\\n\"But not a dreary place at present, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\\n\"And Bleak House,\" said his lordship, \"is in--\"\\n\\n\"Hertfordshire, my lord.\"\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House is not married?\" said his lordship.\\n\\n\"He is not, my lord,\" said Mr. Kenge.\\n\\nA pause.\\n\\n\"Young Mr. Richard Carstone is present?\" said the Lord Chancellor,\\nglancing towards him.\\n\\nRichard bowed and stepped forward.\\n\\n\"Hum!\" said the Lord Chancellor, turning over more leaves.\\n\\n\"Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, my lord,\" Mr. Kenge observed in a low\\nvoice, \"if I may venture to remind your lordship, provides a suitable\\ncompanion for--\"\\n\\n\"For Mr. Richard Carstone?\" I thought (but I am not quite sure) I\\nheard his lordship say in an equally low voice and with a smile.\\n\\n\"For Miss Ada Clare. This is the young lady. Miss Summerson.\"\\n\\nHis lordship gave me an indulgent look and acknowledged my curtsy\\nvery graciously.\\n\\n\"Miss Summerson is not related to any party in the cause, I think?\"\\n\\n\"No, my lord.\"\\n\\nMr. Kenge leant over before it was quite said and whispered. His\\nlordship, with his eyes upon his papers, listened, nodded twice or\\nthrice, turned over more leaves, and did not look towards me again\\nuntil we were going away.\\n\\nMr. Kenge now retired, and Richard with him, to where I was, near the\\ndoor, leaving my pet (it is so natural to me that again I can\\'t help\\nit!) sitting near the Lord Chancellor, with whom his lordship spoke a\\nlittle part, asking her, as she told me afterwards, whether she had\\nwell reflected on the proposed arrangement, and if she thought she\\nwould be happy under the roof of Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House, and why\\nshe thought so? Presently he rose courteously and released her, and\\nthen he spoke for a minute or two with Richard Carstone, not seated,\\nbut standing, and altogether with more ease and less ceremony, as if\\nhe still knew, though he WAS Lord Chancellor, how to go straight to\\nthe candour of a boy.\\n\\n\"Very well!\" said his lordship aloud. \"I shall make the order. Mr.\\nJarndyce of Bleak House has chosen, so far as I may judge,\" and this\\nwas when he looked at me, \"a very good companion for the young lady,\\nand the arrangement altogether seems the best of which the\\ncircumstances admit.\"\\n\\nHe dismissed us pleasantly, and we all went out, very much obliged to\\nhim for being so affable and polite, by which he had certainly lost\\nno dignity but seemed to us to have gained some.\\n\\nWhen we got under the colonnade, Mr. Kenge remembered that he must go\\nback for a moment to ask a question and left us in the fog, with the\\nLord Chancellor\\'s carriage and servants waiting for him to come out.\\n\\n\"Well!\" said Richard Carstone. \"THAT\\'S over! And where do we go next,\\nMiss Summerson?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t you know?\" I said.\\n\\n\"Not in the least,\" said he.\\n\\n\"And don\\'t YOU know, my love?\" I asked Ada.\\n\\n\"No!\" said she. \"Don\\'t you?\"\\n\\n\"Not at all!\" said I.\\n\\nWe looked at one another, half laughing at our being like the\\nchildren in the wood, when a curious little old woman in a squeezed\\nbonnet and carrying a reticule came curtsying and smiling up to us\\nwith an air of great ceremony.\\n\\n\"Oh!\" said she. \"The wards in Jarndyce! Ve-ry happy, I am sure, to\\nhave the honour! It is a good omen for youth, and hope, and beauty\\nwhen they find themselves in this place, and don\\'t know what\\'s to\\ncome of it.\"\\n\\n\"Mad!\" whispered Richard, not thinking she could hear him.\\n\\n\"Right! Mad, young gentleman,\" she returned so quickly that he was\\nquite abashed. \"I was a ward myself. I was not mad at that time,\"\\ncurtsying low and smiling between every little sentence. \"I had youth\\nand hope. I believe, beauty. It matters very little now. Neither of\\nthe three served or saved me. I have the honour to attend court\\nregularly. With my documents. I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the\\nDay of Judgment. I have discovered that the sixth seal mentioned in\\nthe Revelations is the Great Seal. It has been open a long time! Pray\\naccept my blessing.\"\\n\\nAs Ada was a little frightened, I said, to humour the poor old lady,\\nthat we were much obliged to her.\\n\\n\"Ye-es!\" she said mincingly. \"I imagine so. And here is Conversation\\nKenge. With HIS documents! How does your honourable worship do?\"\\n\\n\"Quite well, quite well! Now don\\'t be troublesome, that\\'s a good\\nsoul!\" said Mr. Kenge, leading the way back.\\n\\n\"By no means,\" said the poor old lady, keeping up with Ada and me.\\n\"Anything but troublesome. I shall confer estates on both--which is\\nnot being troublesome, I trust? I expect a judgment. Shortly. On the\\nDay of Judgment. This is a good omen for you. Accept my blessing!\"\\n\\nShe stopped at the bottom of the steep, broad flight of stairs; but\\nwe looked back as we went up, and she was still there, saying, still\\nwith a curtsy and a smile between every little sentence, \"Youth. And\\nhope. And beauty. And Chancery. And Conversation Kenge! Ha! Pray\\naccept my blessing!\"\\n\\n\\n\\nWe were to pass the night, Mr. Kenge told us when we arrived in his\\nroom, at Mrs. Jellyby\\'s; and then he turned to me and said he took it\\nfor granted I knew who Mrs. Jellyby was.\\n\\n\"I really don\\'t, sir,\" I returned. \"Perhaps Mr. Carstone--or Miss\\nClare--\"\\n\\nBut no, they knew nothing whatever about Mrs. Jellyby. \"In-deed! Mrs.\\nJellyby,\" said Mr. Kenge, standing with his back to the fire and\\ncasting his eyes over the dusty hearth-rug as if it were Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s biography, \"is a lady of very remarkable strength of\\ncharacter who devotes herself entirely to the public. She has devoted\\nherself to an extensive variety of public subjects at various times\\nand is at present (until something else attracts her) devoted to the\\nsubject of Africa, with a view to the general cultivation of the\\ncoffee berry--AND the natives--and the happy settlement, on the banks\\nof the African rivers, of our superabundant home population. Mr.\\nJarndyce, who is desirous to aid any work that is considered likely\\nto be a good work and who is much sought after by philanthropists,\\nhas, I believe, a very high opinion of Mrs. Jellyby.\"\\n\\nMr. Kenge, adjusting his cravat, then looked at us.\\n\\n\"And Mr. Jellyby, sir?\" suggested Richard.\\n\\n\"Ah! Mr. Jellyby,\" said Mr. Kenge, \"is--a--I don\\'t know that I can\\ndescribe him to you better than by saying that he is the husband of\\nMrs. Jellyby.\"\\n\\n\"A nonentity, sir?\" said Richard with a droll look.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t say that,\" returned Mr. Kenge gravely. \"I can\\'t say that,\\nindeed, for I know nothing whatever OF Mr. Jellyby. I never, to my\\nknowledge, had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jellyby. He may be a very\\nsuperior man, but he is, so to speak, merged--merged--in the more\\nshining qualities of his wife.\" Mr. Kenge proceeded to tell us that\\nas the road to Bleak House would have been very long, dark, and\\ntedious on such an evening, and as we had been travelling already,\\nMr. Jarndyce had himself proposed this arrangement. A carriage would\\nbe at Mrs. Jellyby\\'s to convey us out of town early in the forenoon\\nof to-morrow.\\n\\nHe then rang a little bell, and the young gentleman came in.\\nAddressing him by the name of Guppy, Mr. Kenge inquired whether Miss\\nSummerson\\'s boxes and the rest of the baggage had been \"sent round.\"\\nMr. Guppy said yes, they had been sent round, and a coach was waiting\\nto take us round too as soon as we pleased.\\n\\n\"Then it only remains,\" said Mr. Kenge, shaking hands with us, \"for\\nme to express my lively satisfaction in (good day, Miss Clare!) the\\narrangement this day concluded and my (GOOD-bye to you, Miss\\nSummerson!) lively hope that it will conduce to the happiness, the\\n(glad to have had the honour of making your acquaintance, Mr.\\nCarstone!) welfare, the advantage in all points of view, of all\\nconcerned! Guppy, see the party safely there.\"\\n\\n\"Where IS \\'there,\\' Mr. Guppy?\" said Richard as we went downstairs.\\n\\n\"No distance,\" said Mr. Guppy; \"round in Thavies Inn, you know.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t say I know where it is, for I come from Winchester and am\\nstrange in London.\"\\n\\n\"Only round the corner,\" said Mr. Guppy. \"We just twist up Chancery\\nLane, and cut along Holborn, and there we are in four minutes\\' time,\\nas near as a toucher. This is about a London particular NOW, ain\\'t\\nit, miss?\" He seemed quite delighted with it on my account.\\n\\n\"The fog is very dense indeed!\" said I.\\n\\n\"Not that it affects you, though, I\\'m sure,\" said Mr. Guppy, putting\\nup the steps. \"On the contrary, it seems to do you good, miss,\\njudging from your appearance.\"\\n\\nI knew he meant well in paying me this compliment, so I laughed at\\nmyself for blushing at it when he had shut the door and got upon the\\nbox; and we all three laughed and chatted about our inexperience and\\nthe strangeness of London until we turned up under an archway to our\\ndestination--a narrow street of high houses like an oblong cistern to\\nhold the fog. There was a confused little crowd of people,\\nprincipally children, gathered about the house at which we stopped,\\nwhich had a tarnished brass plate on the door with the inscription\\nJELLYBY.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be frightened!\" said Mr. Guppy, looking in at the\\ncoach-window. \"One of the young Jellybys been and got his head\\nthrough the area railings!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, poor child,\" said I; \"let me out, if you please!\"\\n\\n\"Pray be careful of yourself, miss. The young Jellybys are always up\\nto something,\" said Mr. Guppy.\\n\\nI made my way to the poor child, who was one of the dirtiest little\\nunfortunates I ever saw, and found him very hot and frightened and\\ncrying loudly, fixed by the neck between two iron railings, while a\\nmilkman and a beadle, with the kindest intentions possible, were\\nendeavouring to drag him back by the legs, under a general impression\\nthat his skull was compressible by those means. As I found (after\\npacifying him) that he was a little boy with a naturally large head,\\nI thought that perhaps where his head could go, his body could\\nfollow, and mentioned that the best mode of extrication might be to\\npush him forward. This was so favourably received by the milkman and\\nbeadle that he would immediately have been pushed into the area if I\\nhad not held his pinafore while Richard and Mr. Guppy ran down\\nthrough the kitchen to catch him when he should be released. At last\\nhe was happily got down without any accident, and then he began to\\nbeat Mr. Guppy with a hoop-stick in quite a frantic manner.\\n\\nNobody had appeared belonging to the house except a person in\\npattens, who had been poking at the child from below with a broom; I\\ndon\\'t know with what object, and I don\\'t think she did. I therefore\\nsupposed that Mrs. Jellyby was not at home, and was quite surprised\\nwhen the person appeared in the passage without the pattens, and\\ngoing up to the back room on the first floor before Ada and me,\\nannounced us as, \"Them two young ladies, Missis Jellyby!\" We passed\\nseveral more children on the way up, whom it was difficult to avoid\\ntreading on in the dark; and as we came into Mrs. Jellyby\\'s presence,\\none of the poor little things fell downstairs--down a whole flight\\n(as it sounded to me), with a great noise.\\n\\nMrs. Jellyby, whose face reflected none of the uneasiness which we\\ncould not help showing in our own faces as the dear child\\'s head\\nrecorded its passage with a bump on every stair--Richard afterwards\\nsaid he counted seven, besides one for the landing--received us with\\nperfect equanimity. She was a pretty, very diminutive, plump woman of\\nfrom forty to fifty, with handsome eyes, though they had a curious\\nhabit of seeming to look a long way off. As if--I am quoting Richard\\nagain--they could see nothing nearer than Africa!\\n\\n\"I am very glad indeed,\" said Mrs. Jellyby in an agreeable voice, \"to\\nhave the pleasure of receiving you. I have a great respect for Mr.\\nJarndyce, and no one in whom he is interested can be an object of\\nindifference to me.\"\\n\\nWe expressed our acknowledgments and sat down behind the door, where\\nthere was a lame invalid of a sofa. Mrs. Jellyby had very good hair\\nbut was too much occupied with her African duties to brush it. The\\nshawl in which she had been loosely muffled dropped onto her chair\\nwhen she advanced to us; and as she turned to resume her seat, we\\ncould not help noticing that her dress didn\\'t nearly meet up the back\\nand that the open space was railed across with a lattice-work of\\nstay-lace--like a summer-house.\\n\\nThe room, which was strewn with papers and nearly filled by a great\\nwriting-table covered with similar litter, was, I must say, not only\\nvery untidy but very dirty. We were obliged to take notice of that\\nwith our sense of sight, even while, with our sense of hearing, we\\nfollowed the poor child who had tumbled downstairs: I think into the\\nback kitchen, where somebody seemed to stifle him.\\n\\nBut what principally struck us was a jaded and unhealthy-looking\\nthough by no means plain girl at the writing-table, who sat biting\\nthe feather of her pen and staring at us. I suppose nobody ever was\\nin such a state of ink. And from her tumbled hair to her pretty feet,\\nwhich were disfigured with frayed and broken satin slippers trodden\\ndown at heel, she really seemed to have no article of dress upon her,\\nfrom a pin upwards, that was in its proper condition or its right\\nplace.\\n\\n\"You find me, my dears,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, snuffing the two great\\noffice candles in tin candlesticks, which made the room taste\\nstrongly of hot tallow (the fire had gone out, and there was nothing\\nin the grate but ashes, a bundle of wood, and a poker), \"you find me,\\nmy dears, as usual, very busy; but that you will excuse. The African\\nproject at present employs my whole time. It involves me in\\ncorrespondence with public bodies and with private individuals\\nanxious for the welfare of their species all over the country. I am\\nhappy to say it is advancing. We hope by this time next year to have\\nfrom a hundred and fifty to two hundred healthy families cultivating\\ncoffee and educating the natives of Borrioboola-Gha, on the left bank\\nof the Niger.\"\\n\\nAs Ada said nothing, but looked at me, I said it must be very\\ngratifying.\\n\\n\"It IS gratifying,\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"It involves the devotion of\\nall my energies, such as they are; but that is nothing, so that it\\nsucceeds; and I am more confident of success every day. Do you know,\\nMiss Summerson, I almost wonder that YOU never turned your thoughts\\nto Africa.\"\\n\\nThis application of the subject was really so unexpected to me that I\\nwas quite at a loss how to receive it. I hinted that the climate--\\n\\n\"The finest climate in the world!\" said Mrs. Jellyby.\\n\\n\"Indeed, ma\\'am?\"\\n\\n\"Certainly. With precaution,\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"You may go into\\nHolborn, without precaution, and be run over. You may go into\\nHolborn, with precaution, and never be run over. Just so with\\nAfrica.\"\\n\\nI said, \"No doubt.\" I meant as to Holborn.\\n\\n\"If you would like,\" said Mrs. Jellyby, putting a number of papers\\ntowards us, \"to look over some remarks on that head, and on the\\ngeneral subject, which have been extensively circulated, while I\\nfinish a letter I am now dictating to my eldest daughter, who is my\\namanuensis--\"\\n\\nThe girl at the table left off biting her pen and made a return to\\nour recognition, which was half bashful and half sulky.\\n\\n\"--I shall then have finished for the present,\" proceeded Mrs.\\nJellyby with a sweet smile, \"though my work is never done. Where are\\nyou, Caddy?\"\\n\\n\"\\'Presents her compliments to Mr. Swallow, and begs--\\'\" said Caddy.\\n\\n\"\\'And begs,\\'\" said Mrs. Jellyby, dictating, \"\\'to inform him, in\\nreference to his letter of inquiry on the African project--\\' No,\\nPeepy! Not on my account!\"\\n\\nPeepy (so self-named) was the unfortunate child who had fallen\\ndownstairs, who now interrupted the correspondence by presenting\\nhimself, with a strip of plaster on his forehead, to exhibit his\\nwounded knees, in which Ada and I did not know which to pity\\nmost--the bruises or the dirt. Mrs. Jellyby merely added, with the\\nserene composure with which she said everything, \"Go along, you\\nnaughty Peepy!\" and fixed her fine eyes on Africa again.\\n\\nHowever, as she at once proceeded with her dictation, and as I\\ninterrupted nothing by doing it, I ventured quietly to stop poor\\nPeepy as he was going out and to take him up to nurse. He looked very\\nmuch astonished at it and at Ada\\'s kissing him, but soon fell fast\\nasleep in my arms, sobbing at longer and longer intervals, until he\\nwas quiet. I was so occupied with Peepy that I lost the letter in\\ndetail, though I derived such a general impression from it of the\\nmomentous importance of Africa, and the utter insignificance of all\\nother places and things, that I felt quite ashamed to have thought so\\nlittle about it.\\n\\n\"Six o\\'clock!\" said Mrs. Jellyby. \"And our dinner hour is nominally\\n(for we dine at all hours) five! Caddy, show Miss Clare and Miss\\nSummerson their rooms. You will like to make some change, perhaps?\\nYou will excuse me, I know, being so much occupied. Oh, that very bad\\nchild! Pray put him down, Miss Summerson!\"\\n\\nI begged permission to retain him, truly saying that he was not at\\nall troublesome, and carried him upstairs and laid him on my bed. Ada\\nand I had two upper rooms with a door of communication between. They\\nwere excessively bare and disorderly, and the curtain to my window\\nwas fastened up with a fork.\\n\\n\"You would like some hot water, wouldn\\'t you?\" said Miss Jellyby,\\nlooking round for a jug with a handle to it, but looking in vain.\\n\\n\"If it is not being troublesome,\" said we.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s not the trouble,\" returned Miss Jellyby; \"the question is,\\nif there IS any.\"\\n\\nThe evening was so very cold and the rooms had such a marshy smell\\nthat I must confess it was a little miserable, and Ada was half\\ncrying. We soon laughed, however, and were busily unpacking when Miss\\nJellyby came back to say that she was sorry there was no hot water,\\nbut they couldn\\'t find the kettle, and the boiler was out of order.\\n\\nWe begged her not to mention it and made all the haste we could to\\nget down to the fire again. But all the little children had come up\\nto the landing outside to look at the phenomenon of Peepy lying on my\\nbed, and our attention was distracted by the constant apparition of\\nnoses and fingers in situations of danger between the hinges of the\\ndoors. It was impossible to shut the door of either room, for my\\nlock, with no knob to it, looked as if it wanted to be wound up; and\\nthough the handle of Ada\\'s went round and round with the greatest\\nsmoothness, it was attended with no effect whatever on the door.\\nTherefore I proposed to the children that they should come in and be\\nvery good at my table, and I would tell them the story of Little Red\\nRiding Hood while I dressed; which they did, and were as quiet as\\nmice, including Peepy, who awoke opportunely before the appearance of\\nthe wolf.\\n\\nWhen we went downstairs we found a mug with \"A Present from Tunbridge\\nWells\" on it lighted up in the staircase window with a floating wick,\\nand a young woman, with a swelled face bound up in a flannel bandage\\nblowing the fire of the drawing-room (now connected by an open door\\nwith Mrs. Jellyby\\'s room) and choking dreadfully. It smoked to that\\ndegree, in short, that we all sat coughing and crying with the\\nwindows open for half an hour, during which Mrs. Jellyby, with the\\nsame sweetness of temper, directed letters about Africa. Her being so\\nemployed was, I must say, a great relief to me, for Richard told us\\nthat he had washed his hands in a pie-dish and that they had found\\nthe kettle on his dressing-table, and he made Ada laugh so that they\\nmade me laugh in the most ridiculous manner.\\n\\nSoon after seven o\\'clock we went down to dinner, carefully, by Mrs.\\nJellyby\\'s advice, for the stair-carpets, besides being very deficient\\nin stair-wires, were so torn as to be absolute traps. We had a fine\\ncod-fish, a piece of roast beef, a dish of cutlets, and a pudding; an\\nexcellent dinner, if it had had any cooking to speak of, but it was\\nalmost raw. The young woman with the flannel bandage waited, and\\ndropped everything on the table wherever it happened to go, and never\\nmoved it again until she put it on the stairs. The person I had seen\\nin pattens, who I suppose to have been the cook, frequently came and\\nskirmished with her at the door, and there appeared to be ill will\\nbetween them.\\n\\nAll through dinner--which was long, in consequence of such accidents\\nas the dish of potatoes being mislaid in the coal skuttle and the\\nhandle of the corkscrew coming off and striking the young woman in\\nthe chin--Mrs. Jellyby preserved the evenness of her disposition. She\\ntold us a great deal that was interesting about Borrioboola-Gha and\\nthe natives, and received so many letters that Richard, who sat by\\nher, saw four envelopes in the gravy at once. Some of the letters\\nwere proceedings of ladies\\' committees or resolutions of ladies\\'\\nmeetings, which she read to us; others were applications from people\\nexcited in various ways about the cultivation of coffee, and natives;\\nothers required answers, and these she sent her eldest daughter from\\nthe table three or four times to write. She was full of business and\\nundoubtedly was, as she had told us, devoted to the cause.\\n\\nI was a little curious to know who a mild bald gentleman in\\nspectacles was, who dropped into a vacant chair (there was no top or\\nbottom in particular) after the fish was taken away and seemed\\npassively to submit himself to Borrioboola-Gha but not to be actively\\ninterested in that settlement. As he never spoke a word, he might\\nhave been a native but for his complexion. It was not until we left\\nthe table and he remained alone with Richard that the possibility of\\nhis being Mr. Jellyby ever entered my head. But he WAS Mr. Jellyby;\\nand a loquacious young man called Mr. Quale, with large shining knobs\\nfor temples and his hair all brushed to the back of his head, who\\ncame in the evening, and told Ada he was a philanthropist, also\\ninformed her that he called the matrimonial alliance of Mrs. Jellyby\\nwith Mr. Jellyby the union of mind and matter.\\n\\nThis young man, besides having a great deal to say for himself about\\nAfrica and a project of his for teaching the coffee colonists to\\nteach the natives to turn piano-forte legs and establish an export\\ntrade, delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby out by saying, \"I believe\\nnow, Mrs. Jellyby, you have received as many as from one hundred and\\nfifty to two hundred letters respecting Africa in a single day, have\\nyou not?\" or, \"If my memory does not deceive me, Mrs. Jellyby, you\\nonce mentioned that you had sent off five thousand circulars from one\\npost-office at one time?\"--always repeating Mrs. Jellyby\\'s answer to\\nus like an interpreter. During the whole evening, Mr. Jellyby sat in\\na corner with his head against the wall as if he were subject to low\\nspirits. It seemed that he had several times opened his mouth when\\nalone with Richard after dinner, as if he had something on his mind,\\nbut had always shut it again, to Richard\\'s extreme confusion, without\\nsaying anything.\\n\\nMrs. Jellyby, sitting in quite a nest of waste paper, drank coffee\\nall the evening and dictated at intervals to her eldest daughter. She\\nalso held a discussion with Mr. Quale, of which the subject seemed to\\nbe--if I understood it--the brotherhood of humanity, and gave\\nutterance to some beautiful sentiments. I was not so attentive an\\nauditor as I might have wished to be, however, for Peepy and the\\nother children came flocking about Ada and me in a corner of the\\ndrawing-room to ask for another story; so we sat down among them and\\ntold them in whispers \"Puss in Boots\" and I don\\'t know what else\\nuntil Mrs. Jellyby, accidentally remembering them, sent them to bed.\\nAs Peepy cried for me to take him to bed, I carried him upstairs,\\nwhere the young woman with the flannel bandage charged into the midst\\nof the little family like a dragon and overturned them into cribs.\\n\\nAfter that I occupied myself in making our room a little tidy and in\\ncoaxing a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn, which at\\nlast it did, quite brightly. On my return downstairs, I felt that\\nMrs. Jellyby looked down upon me rather for being so frivolous, and I\\nwas sorry for it, though at the same time I knew that I had no higher\\npretensions.\\n\\nIt was nearly midnight before we found an opportunity of going to\\nbed, and even then we left Mrs. Jellyby among her papers drinking\\ncoffee and Miss Jellyby biting the feather of her pen.\\n\\n\"What a strange house!\" said Ada when we got upstairs. \"How curious\\nof my cousin Jarndyce to send us here!\"\\n\\n\"My love,\" said I, \"it quite confuses me. I want to understand it,\\nand I can\\'t understand it at all.\"\\n\\n\"What?\" asked Ada with her pretty smile.\\n\\n\"All this, my dear,\" said I. \"It MUST be very good of Mrs. Jellyby to\\ntake such pains about a scheme for the benefit of natives--and\\nyet--Peepy and the housekeeping!\"\\n\\nAda laughed and put her arm about my neck as I stood looking at the\\nfire, and told me I was a quiet, dear, good creature and had won her\\nheart. \"You are so thoughtful, Esther,\" she said, \"and yet so\\ncheerful! And you do so much, so unpretendingly! You would make a\\nhome out of even this house.\"\\n\\nMy simple darling! She was quite unconscious that she only praised\\nherself and that it was in the goodness of her own heart that she\\nmade so much of me!\\n\\n\"May I ask you a question?\" said I when we had sat before the fire a\\nlittle while.\\n\\n\"Five hundred,\" said Ada.\\n\\n\"Your cousin, Mr. Jarndyce. I owe so much to him. Would you mind\\ndescribing him to me?\"\\n\\nShaking her golden hair, Ada turned her eyes upon me with such\\nlaughing wonder that I was full of wonder too, partly at her beauty,\\npartly at her surprise.\\n\\n\"Esther!\" she cried.\\n\\n\"My dear!\"\\n\\n\"You want a description of my cousin Jarndyce?\"\\n\\n\"My dear, I never saw him.\"\\n\\n\"And I never saw him!\" returned Ada.\\n\\nWell, to be sure!\\n\\nNo, she had never seen him. Young as she was when her mama died, she\\nremembered how the tears would come into her eyes when she spoke of\\nhim and of the noble generosity of his character, which she had said\\nwas to be trusted above all earthly things; and Ada trusted it. Her\\ncousin Jarndyce had written to her a few months ago--\"a plain, honest\\nletter,\" Ada said--proposing the arrangement we were now to enter on\\nand telling her that \"in time it might heal some of the wounds made\\nby the miserable Chancery suit.\" She had replied, gratefully\\naccepting his proposal. Richard had received a similar letter and had\\nmade a similar response. He HAD seen Mr. Jarndyce once, but only\\nonce, five years ago, at Winchester school. He had told Ada, when\\nthey were leaning on the screen before the fire where I found them,\\nthat he recollected him as \"a bluff, rosy fellow.\" This was the\\nutmost description Ada could give me.\\n\\nIt set me thinking so that when Ada was asleep, I still remained\\nbefore the fire, wondering and wondering about Bleak House, and\\nwondering and wondering that yesterday morning should seem so long\\nago. I don\\'t know where my thoughts had wandered when they were\\nrecalled by a tap at the door.\\n\\nI opened it softly and found Miss Jellyby shivering there with a\\nbroken candle in a broken candlestick in one hand and an egg-cup in\\nthe other.\\n\\n\"Good night!\" she said very sulkily.\\n\\n\"Good night!\" said I.\\n\\n\"May I come in?\" she shortly and unexpectedly asked me in the same\\nsulky way.\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" said I. \"Don\\'t wake Miss Clare.\"\\n\\nShe would not sit down, but stood by the fire dipping her inky middle\\nfinger in the egg-cup, which contained vinegar, and smearing it over\\nthe ink stains on her face, frowning the whole time and looking very\\ngloomy.\\n\\n\"I wish Africa was dead!\" she said on a sudden.\\n\\nI was going to remonstrate.\\n\\n\"I do!\" she said \"Don\\'t talk to me, Miss Summerson. I hate it and\\ndetest it. It\\'s a beast!\"\\n\\nI told her she was tired, and I was sorry. I put my hand upon her\\nhead, and touched her forehead, and said it was hot now but would be\\ncool to-morrow. She still stood pouting and frowning at me, but\\npresently put down her egg-cup and turned softly towards the bed\\nwhere Ada lay.\\n\\n\"She is very pretty!\" she said with the same knitted brow and in the\\nsame uncivil manner.\\n\\nI assented with a smile.\\n\\n\"An orphan. Ain\\'t she?\"\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\"But knows a quantity, I suppose? Can dance, and play music, and\\nsing? She can talk French, I suppose, and do geography, and globes,\\nand needlework, and everything?\"\\n\\n\"No doubt,\" said I.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t,\" she returned. \"I can\\'t do anything hardly, except write.\\nI\\'m always writing for Ma. I wonder you two were not ashamed of\\nyourselves to come in this afternoon and see me able to do nothing\\nelse. It was like your ill nature. Yet you think yourselves very\\nfine, I dare say!\"\\n\\nI could see that the poor girl was near crying, and I resumed my\\nchair without speaking and looked at her (I hope) as mildly as I felt\\ntowards her.\\n\\n\"It\\'s disgraceful,\" she said. \"You know it is. The whole house is\\ndisgraceful. The children are disgraceful. I\\'M disgraceful. Pa\\'s\\nmiserable, and no wonder! Priscilla drinks--she\\'s always drinking.\\nIt\\'s a great shame and a great story of you if you say you didn\\'t\\nsmell her to-day. It was as bad as a public-house, waiting at dinner;\\nyou know it was!\"\\n\\n\"My dear, I don\\'t know it,\" said I.\\n\\n\"You do,\" she said very shortly. \"You shan\\'t say you don\\'t. You do!\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my dear!\" said I. \"If you won\\'t let me speak--\"\\n\\n\"You\\'re speaking now. You know you are. Don\\'t tell stories, Miss\\nSummerson.\"\\n\\n\"My dear,\" said I, \"as long as you won\\'t hear me out--\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want to hear you out.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, yes, I think you do,\" said I, \"because that would be so very\\nunreasonable. I did not know what you tell me because the servant did\\nnot come near me at dinner; but I don\\'t doubt what you tell me, and I\\nam sorry to hear it.\"\\n\\n\"You needn\\'t make a merit of that,\" said she.\\n\\n\"No, my dear,\" said I. \"That would be very foolish.\"\\n\\nShe was still standing by the bed, and now stooped down (but still\\nwith the same discontented face) and kissed Ada. That done, she came\\nsoftly back and stood by the side of my chair. Her bosom was heaving\\nin a distressful manner that I greatly pitied, but I thought it\\nbetter not to speak.\\n\\n\"I wish I was dead!\" she broke out. \"I wish we were all dead. It\\nwould be a great deal better for us.\"\\n\\nIn a moment afterwards, she knelt on the ground at my side, hid her\\nface in my dress, passionately begged my pardon, and wept. I\\ncomforted her and would have raised her, but she cried no, no; she\\nwanted to stay there!\\n\\n\"You used to teach girls,\" she said, \"If you could only have taught\\nme, I could have learnt from you! I am so very miserable, and I like\\nyou so much!\"\\n\\nI could not persuade her to sit by me or to do anything but move a\\nragged stool to where she was kneeling, and take that, and still hold\\nmy dress in the same manner. By degrees the poor tired girl fell\\nasleep, and then I contrived to raise her head so that it should rest\\non my lap, and to cover us both with shawls. The fire went out, and\\nall night long she slumbered thus before the ashy grate. At first I\\nwas painfully awake and vainly tried to lose myself, with my eyes\\nclosed, among the scenes of the day. At length, by slow degrees, they\\nbecame indistinct and mingled. I began to lose the identity of the\\nsleeper resting on me. Now it was Ada, now one of my old Reading\\nfriends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted. Now\\nit was the little mad woman worn out with curtsying and smiling, now\\nsome one in authority at Bleak House. Lastly, it was no one, and I\\nwas no one.\\n\\nThe purblind day was feebly struggling with the fog when I opened my\\neyes to encounter those of a dirty-faced little spectre fixed upon\\nme. Peepy had scaled his crib, and crept down in his bed-gown and\\ncap, and was so cold that his teeth were chattering as if he had cut\\nthem all.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'model_output': \"The novel Bleak House by Charles Dickens is set in London and the surrounding countryside in the nineteenth century. The story revolves around the Jarndyce and Jarndyce court case that has been dragging on for years in the Court of Chancery. One of the main characters is the orphan Esther Summerson, who has been raised by her godmother and is going to live at Bleak House with her guardian, Mr. Jarndyce, whom she has never met. Esther meets her fellow ward Ada Clare, Mr. Jarndyce's cousin, who will also live at Bleak House. The lawyer Mr. Kenge arranges for Esther and Ada to meet the Lord Chancellor regarding their guardianship. Another family introduced is the Jellybys - Mrs. Jellyby is obsessed with charity work relating to Africa and neglects her own family. Before traveling to Bleak House, Esther and Ada stay with the disorganized Jellyby family. The atmosphere around Bleak House is bleak, foggy and muddy. Overall, the early chapters introduce key characters and establish the bleak, muddy setting of London and Bleak House where the complex Jarndyce court case is central to the plot.\"}]\n"

In Newton Stewart, the River Cree burst its banks and overflowed after a retaining wall was breached, leading to severe flooding on Victoria Street where many shops and other businesses were inundated with water. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited Newton Stewart to see the damage for herself and speak to local residents and business owners like Jeanette Tate, owner of the flooded Cinnamon Cafe, who felt more could have been done to maintain the retaining wall. The full cost of the Newton Stewart flooding is still being assessed as repair work continues. Meanwhile, many roads across Peeblesshire remain underwater due to constant rain. The flooding has also impacted train services, with disruption on the west coast mainline because of damage to the Lamington Viaduct. With more rain forecast, a flood alert remains in place across the Scottish Borders. In response to the flooding, Labour MSP Alex Rowley visited Hawick and backed calls to speed up flood prevention measures in the most vulnerable areas, urging the setting of a clear timetable for the flood protection plan process. The local council has listed the roads worst affected by the flooding and warned drivers not to ignore road closure signs. The recent heavy rains have caused severe flooding across southern Scotland, particularly in Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders. Specifically, the River Cree overflowed its banks in Newton Stewart after a retaining wall was breached, leading to extensive flooding and damage in the town center along Victoria Street where many shops and businesses were flooded. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited Newton Stewart to survey the damage and speak with impacted residents and business owners. The full extent of the economic losses and property damage in Newton Stewart is still being evaluated as repair efforts continue. Meanwhile, the market town of Peebles along the flooded River Tweed was also severely affected, with many roads remaining closed across Peeblesshire due to standing water. Labour MSP Alex Rowley visited the flooded areas of Hawick to see the situation firsthand and is calling for faster implementation of flood defenses to protect vulnerable communities. Disruption to train service continues as well, as the Lamington Viaduct on the west coast mainline was damaged. With more heavy rain forecast across southern Scotland, flooding remains a risk and many roads and rail lines face prolonged closures as repairs are underway. The full aftermath of the widespread flooding is still unfolding.\\n'}, {'text': 'A fire alarm went off at the Holiday Inn in Hope Street at about 04:20 BST on Saturday and guests were asked to leave the hotel.\\nAs they gathered outside they saw the two buses, parked side-by-side in the car park, engulfed by flames.\\nOne of the tour groups is from Germany, the other from China and Taiwan.

The man, who was alone in a room at the time and did not actually take any hostages as was initially reported, had previously had his service firearm taken away after the hospital submitted a report saying he should not carry a gun. However, the gun he had on Wednesday was not his official service weapon. The hospital's chief consultant clarified that there was no hostage situation, just the man alone in a room. This incident comes amid heightened tensions in Istanbul following recent attacks like the mass shooting at the Reina nightclub on New Year's Eve that killed 39 people. Though early reports suggested a hostage scenario, the reality was that a mentally unstable young man who should not have had access to any firearm was alone in a room at the psychiatric hospital where he had been receiving treatment for 2 years, threatening to harm himself and others. The evacuation of patients and staff was precautionary, and no shots were fired during the incident. According to additional details, the man opened fire with a personal firearm, not his issued service weapon, prompting the evacuation as officers were deployed to negotiate with him. Earlier incorrect reports stated he had taken hostages, but it was determined he was alone in the room. The shooting comes during heightened tensions in Istanbul after recent attacks like at the Reina nightclub. Authorities worked to contain the situation, ensure safety, and apprehend the gunman, though his motivations remain unclear.

On Sunday, 25-year-old Antoine Demoitié was competing in the Gent-Wevelgem race in northern France when he was struck by a motorbike and killed. The collision occurred after Demoitié and several other riders crashed as the peloton passed through the town of Sainte-Marie-Cappel. Demoitié was rushed to the hospital in Lille but died of his injuries. The death has sparked an outcry over the large number of motorbikes that drive alongside the cyclists during races - around 50 motorbikes work each race. Luke Rowe of Team Sky said there are simply too many motorbikes whizzing past the cyclists during races, putting them at risk. He suggested limiting the speed of motorbikes so they pass cyclists at just 10 kph faster than the cyclists themselves. Both the International Cycling Union (UCI) and the Professional Cyclists' Association have called for a full investigation into Demoitié's death and demanded to know what will be done to improve safety measures. However, Rowe lamented that despite this tragedy, attitudes are unlikely to change. Worrying about crashes leads to failure, he said, and racers know the risks when they line up at the start.

Newsround reporter Jenny Lawrence explains.\", 'summary': 'Hurricane Patricia has been rated as a category 5 storm.', 'id': '34615665', 'model_output': \"\\nIn October 2015, mainland Mexico was hit by a tropical storm of unprecedented magnitude - the first storm of this high intensity to make landfall since 1959. As reported by Newsround's Jenny Lawrence, this storm reached the highest rating on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, which is used to classify tropical storms according to their wind speed. The Saffir-Simpson scale has 5 categories, with 5 being the most dangerous storms. Category 5 storms like this one have sustained wind speeds of 157 mph or higher. Prior to making landfall in Mexico, this storm had reached the maximum Category 5 rating, with devastating winds over 157 mph. Mexico had not experienced a storm of this intensity in over 50 years. Jenny Lawrence explained how the Saffir-Simpson scale is used to rate storms, with the 5 categories based on increasing wind speeds. Category 5 is the highest rating, reserved for the most intense and destructive storms. This unprecedented tropical storm that hit Mexico in October 2015 is an example of one of these rare Category 5 hurricanes. By reaching the maximum rating on the scale, it became the worst storm to impact Mexico since 1959. The text does not specify the exact location where the massive storm made landfall along Mexico's coastline, only stating that it was somewhere on the mainland. Likewise, the name of the storm is not mentioned. While the 1959 storm that hit Mexico is noted as being Category 5, no details are provided about its strength, size, damage caused, or where exactly it made landfall. The 2015 storm is simply described as the first Category 5 since then to directly impact mainland Mexico. No specifics are given about the 2015 storm's origins, path across the ocean prior to hitting Mexico, wind speeds, or any damage, flooding, deaths or injuries resulting from its landfall. There is no mention of preparations Mexico may or may not have made ahead of the powerful storm's arrival. The text gives no comparisons between this Category 5 storm and others in the region in terms of intensity, scope of impact, or strength of winds and storm surge. In summary, the text simply states that an unnamed Category 5 storm, the first since 1959, struck mainland Mexico directly in October of 2015, without providing any additional contextual details about that storm or the one that impacted Mexico over 55 years earlier.\\n\"}, {'text': 'Weaknesses in the way mice swapped data with computers left them vulnerable, said security firm Bastille Networks.\\nAttackers could spoof poorly protected signals letting them use PCs as if they were sitting in front of them, it said.\\nInformation about the loopholes have been passed to the makers of vulnerable mice, some of who are creating updates to make the mice more secure.\\nThe radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a \"dongle\" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research.\\n\"That makes it possible for the attacker to send unencrypted traffic to the dongle pretending to be a keyboard and have it result as keystrokes on your computer,\" Mr Newlin said.\\nBy contrast, they said, signals sent by wireless keyboards were scrambled to stop attackers eavesdropping on or spoofing them.\\nThe pair found they could spoof signals for mice using a few lines of code and an antenna and dongle that cost $20 (Â£15).\\nThe attack worked at distances of up to 180m (590ft).\\nUsing this kit, they sent specially crafted mouse clicks that a computer interpreted as key presses, letting them run commands and take control of a target machine.\\nThe Bastille researchers said many companies spent a lot of time and money securing the physical devices sitting on their networks but often neglected to keep an eye on data sent via radio.\\nWireless mice produced by HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were found to be vulnerable.\\nBastille said it had reported its findings to the hardware makers and to the company that made the chipset used inside the spoofable mice.\\nUpdates to the internal computer code, or firmware, for some of the vulnerable mice are now being made available,\\nBut Bastille said many of the insecure mice it had found could not be updated.', 'summary': 'Hackers could gain access to home and corporate networks via security flaws in wireless mice, suggests research.', 'id': '35890902', 'model_output': \"A vulnerability in wireless mice allowed attackers to spoof radio signals and control victim computers as if sitting in front of them, according to research by security firm Bastille Networks.

By analyzing the unencrypted radio signals from the mice, the attackers could determine how the mouse was being used, such as tracking mouse movements and clicks.

The researchers found wireless mice from major brands like HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were affected. Bastille responsibly disclosed the findings to the mouse makers and chipset vendors involved. Some have since released firmware updates to address the issue by adding encryption to the mice's wireless signals. However, many vulnerable wireless mice cannot be patched or updated through firmware, leaving them permanently vulnerable. So while many wireless mice can now be secured through updates, Bastille recommends users switch to wired mice or those with the latest firmware revisions if possible to avoid falling victim to this attack vector.\"}, {'text': 'Administrators confirmed the redundancies affecting 38 staff at Galashiels-based Murray and Burrell.\\nThe business, established in 1928, went into administration last week citing \"adverse trading conditions\".\\nThere are hopes some of the workers affected could find posts at another building firm in nearby Melrose which currently requires staff.\\nThomson Cooper partner Richard Gardiner was appointed as administrator at Murray and Burrell on Monday.\\nA statement confirmed: \"Directors explored all options in an effort to preserve trading and jobs.\\n\"Regrettably, 38 jobs were lost as there is no prospect of continuing to trade.\"\\nSouth of Scotland MSP Rachael Hamilton described it as a \"sad day for the Borders\".\\nHowever, some of the workers laid off could find employment with a Melrose-based company.\\nJS Crawford has said that, with several housing projects on its books, it needs staff.', 'summary': 'Dozens of jobs have been lost after efforts to save an historic building firm in the Scottish Borders failed.', 'id': '37922330', 'model_output': \"The historic Galashiels-based company Murray and Burrell, established in 1928, went into administration last week, citing adverse trading conditions.

In response, there have been calls for investigations into these and similar crashes in order to identify ways to improve safety, such as implementing speed limits for passing vehicles. However, some pro cyclists argue that being overly concerned with potential crashes can be detrimental to performance. They contend that fear and worry while racing will only hurt their focus.

      "The European Commission began a probe of the tax arrangement last year, saying that it had suspicions it broke EU rules.\n",
      "The Commission document, which was sent to the Luxembourg Ministry of Foreign Affairs in October, gives its rationale for launching the investigation.\n",

Luxembourg denies giving any special treatment to Amazon and expresses confidence that the tax arrangement is legitimate. The probe into Amazon is part of the EC's broader crackdown on tax avoidance by multinationals like Fiat, Apple, and Starbucks.

      "Flooding caused major damage and disruption across parts of southern Scotland this week, with Newton Stewart and Peebles among the worst affected areas. In Newton Stewart, the River Cree burst its banks and overflowed after a retaining wall was breached, leading to severe flooding on Victoria Street where many shops and other businesses were inundated with water. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited Newton Stewart to see the damage for herself and speak to local residents and business owners like Jeanette Tate, owner of the flooded Cinnamon Cafe, who felt more could have been done to maintain the retaining wall. The full cost of the Newton Stewart flooding is still being assessed as repair work continues. Meanwhile, many roads across Peeblesshire remain underwater due to constant rain. The flooding has also impacted train services, with disruption on the west coast mainline because of damage to the Lamington Viaduct. With more rain forecast, a flood alert remains in place across the Scottish Borders. In response to the flooding, Labour MSP Alex Rowley visited Hawick and backed calls to speed up flood prevention measures in the most vulnerable areas, urging the setting of a clear timetable for the flood protection plan process. The local council has listed the roads worst affected by the flooding and warned drivers not to ignore road closure signs. The recent heavy rains have caused severe flooding across southern Scotland, particularly in Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders. Specifically, the River Cree overflowed its banks in Newton Stewart after a retaining wall was breached, leading to extensive flooding and damage in the town center along Victoria Street where many shops and businesses were flooded. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited Newton Stewart to survey the damage and speak with impacted residents and business owners. The full extent of the economic losses and property damage in Newton Stewart is still being evaluated as repair efforts continue. Meanwhile, the market town of Peebles along the flooded River Tweed was also severely affected, with many roads remaining closed across Peeblesshire due to standing water. Labour MSP Alex Rowley visited the flooded areas of Hawick to see the situation firsthand and is calling for faster implementation of flood defenses to protect vulnerable communities. Disruption to train service continues as well, as the Lamington Viaduct on the west coast mainline was damaged. With more heavy rain forecast across southern Scotland, flooding remains a risk and many roads and rail lines face prolonged closures as repairs are underway. The full aftermath of the widespread flooding is still unfolding.\n",

      "On Saturday at around 04:20 BST, the fire alarm went off at the Holiday Inn hotel on Hope Street in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Guests were asked to evacuate the building. Among them were two large tour groups, one from Germany and one from China and Taiwan, who were spending their first night in Northern Ireland. While the guests were outside, a fire was deliberately set under one of the tour buses parked outside the hotel. The fire then spread to a second bus. Many passengers had personal belongings like luggage on the buses which were destroyed in the blaze. Both tour groups quickly arranged for replacement coaches so they could proceed with their planned tours of Northern Ireland's stunning north coast, though their trips started later than originally scheduled. The police have appealed to the public for any information about the attack on the tour buses. They believe the fire was started intentionally.\n",

      "On Wednesday, patients and staff were evacuated from Cerahpasa hospital in Istanbul after a young police officer who had been receiving psychiatric treatment there for the past 2 years threatened to shoot himself and others. The man, who was alone in a room at the time and did not actually take any hostages as was initially reported, had previously had his service firearm taken away after the hospital submitted a report saying he should not carry a gun. However, the gun he had on Wednesday was not his official service weapon. The hospital's chief consultant clarified that there was no hostage situation, just the man alone in a room. This incident comes amid heightened tensions in Istanbul following recent attacks like the mass shooting at the Reina nightclub on New Year's Eve that killed 39 people. Though early reports suggested a hostage scenario, the reality was that a mentally unstable young man who should not have had access to any firearm was alone in a room at the psychiatric hospital where he had been receiving treatment for 2 years, threatening to harm himself and others. The evacuation of patients and staff was precautionary, and no shots were fired during the incident. According to additional details, the man opened fire with a personal firearm, not his issued service weapon, prompting the evacuation as officers were deployed to negotiate with him. Earlier incorrect reports stated he had taken hostages, but it was determined he was alone in the room. The shooting comes during heightened tensions in Istanbul after recent attacks like at the Reina nightclub. Authorities worked to contain the situation, ensure safety, and apprehend the gunman, though his motivations remain unclear. The incident serves as a reminder of the anxiety in Istanbul as it recovers from violence.\n",

      "The Glasgow Warriors faced off against the Newport Gwent Dragons in a competitive rugby union match. The Warriors started off strong, with Rory Clegg kicking a penalty to give them a 3-0 lead after 12 minutes. However, the Dragons struck back when Sarel Pretorius scored a try that was converted by Jason Tovey, giving the Dragons a 7-3 lead. The Warriors responded 10 minutes later when Chris Fusaro drove over from a maul for Clegg to convert, putting Glasgow up 10-7. Just before halftime, Taqele Naiyaravoro was yellow carded for the Warriors and Tovey tied it up 10-10 with a penalty goal.  \n",

      "In the second half, the Warriors took control despite being a man down. A break by Mike Blair led to a close-range try for prop Zander Fagerson, converted by Clegg. Then, even with Simone Favaro sin-binned for Glasgow, replacement Junior Bulumakau opportunistically scored for the Warriors after hacking through a loose ball. The Dragons got back in range when excellent combined handling allowed Ashton Hewitt to score unopposed. But Favaro redeemed himself by scoring a crucial try off a rolling maul at the end, converted by Clegg, to earn the Warriors the extra point in a victory over the Dragons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Warriors scored at least 3 tries in the match, with Favaro, Fusaro, Fagerson and Bulumakau all crossing the try line. The Dragons scored at least 2 tries, with Pretorius and Hewitt touching down, and Rynard Landman also scoring before leaving injured. Tovey kicked 2 conversions for the Dragons, while Clegg kicked at least 2 conversions for the Warriors.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The match was close and hard-fought throughout. The Warriors were effective with their rolling mauls to gain territory. The Dragons made errors behind the scrum that cost them field position at times. The Dragons showed improvement from their previous loss to Leinster. A key moment came when Favaro was sin-binned for the Warriors, but the Dragons failed to capitalize on their man advantage. Later, Favaro returned and scored a critical try for the Warriors with the last move of the game, which Clegg converted. The sin-binnings disrupted the flow of the match at times. The Warriors' bench made an impact, with replacement Fagerson scoring. In the end, the Warriors did enough to emerge victorious in a competitive fixture between the sides.\n",

      "The cycling world was rocked by tragedy this past weekend as two young Belgian cyclists died in separate incidents. On Sunday, 25-year-old Antoine Demoitié was competing in the Gent-Wevelgem race in northern France when he was struck by a motorbike and killed. The collision occurred after Demoitié and several other riders crashed as the peloton passed through the town of Sainte-Marie-Cappel. Demoitié was rushed to the hospital in Lille but died of his injuries. The death has sparked an outcry over the large number of motorbikes that drive alongside the cyclists during races - around 50 motorbikes work each race. Luke Rowe of Team Sky said there are simply too many motorbikes whizzing past the cyclists during races, putting them at risk. He suggested limiting the speed of motorbikes so they pass cyclists at just 10 kph faster than the cyclists themselves. Both the International Cycling Union (UCI) and the Professional Cyclists' Association have called for a full investigation into Demoitié's death and demanded to know what will be done to improve safety measures. However, Rowe lamented that despite this tragedy, attitudes are unlikely to change. Worrying about crashes leads to failure, he said, and racers know the risks when they line up at the start. The previous day, another 22-year-old Belgian cyclist, Daan Myngheer, died after suffering a heart attack during the Corsica Tour race. The cycling community mourned the loss of two talented young competitors in the span of just 24 hours.\n",

      "On the morning of 7:20am GMT on [date], a serious car crash occurred at the junction where Progress Road meets the A127 highway in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. A man in his 20s was involved in the collision and sustained significant injuries, including a head injury and suspected multiple fractures. Paramedics arrived to treat the man, providing care for his head wound and potential broken bones at the scene of the crash. Given the extent of his injuries, he was airlifted by helicopter to the Royal London Hospital for further urgent treatment and evaluation. The crash had a major impact on traffic in the area. The southbound lanes of the A127 highway were forced to close for approximately 6 hours following the incident to allow police to thoroughly investigate the circumstances surrounding the crash and to allow for collision investigation and scene clearance. Essex Police attended to conduct initial inquiries, before the investigation was handed over to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) as per standard protocol. With a main road closed for an extended period, there was likely to have been heavy congestion and delays in the vicinity. The circumstances surrounding the collision are unclear at this stage pending further investigation by the IPCC. However, the injuries incurred by the man in his 20s indicate it was a high-impact incident. The priority initially was getting the injured man emergency medical care and restoring normal traffic flow safely, which was able to be achieved some hours later.\n",

      "In October 2015, mainland Mexico was hit by a tropical storm of unprecedented magnitude - the first storm of this high intensity to make landfall since 1959. As reported by Newsround's Jenny Lawrence, this storm reached the highest rating on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, which is used to classify tropical storms according to their wind speed. The Saffir-Simpson scale has 5 categories, with 5 being the most dangerous storms. Category 5 storms like this one have sustained wind speeds of 157 mph or higher. Prior to making landfall in Mexico, this storm had reached the maximum Category 5 rating, with devastating winds over 157 mph. Mexico had not experienced a storm of this intensity in over 50 years. Jenny Lawrence explained how the Saffir-Simpson scale is used to rate storms, with the 5 categories based on increasing wind speeds. Category 5 is the highest rating, reserved for the most intense and destructive storms. This unprecedented tropical storm that hit Mexico in October 2015 is an example of one of these rare Category 5 hurricanes. By reaching the maximum rating on the scale, it became the worst storm to impact Mexico since 1959. The text does not specify the exact location where the massive storm made landfall along Mexico's coastline, only stating that it was somewhere on the mainland. Likewise, the name of the storm is not mentioned. While the 1959 storm that hit Mexico is noted as being Category 5, no details are provided about its strength, size, damage caused, or where exactly it made landfall. The 2015 storm is simply described as the first Category 5 since then to directly impact mainland Mexico. No specifics are given about the 2015 storm's origins, path across the ocean prior to hitting Mexico, wind speeds, or any damage, flooding, deaths or injuries resulting from its landfall. There is no mention of preparations Mexico may or may not have made ahead of the powerful storm's arrival. The text gives no comparisons between this Category 5 storm and others in the region in terms of intensity, scope of impact, or strength of winds and storm surge. In summary, the text simply states that an unnamed Category 5 storm, the first since 1959, struck mainland Mexico directly in October of 2015, without providing any additional contextual details about that storm or the one that impacted Mexico over 55 years earlier.\n",

      "Weaknesses in the way mice swapped data with computers left them vulnerable, said security firm Bastille Networks.\n",
      "Attackers could spoof poorly protected signals letting them use PCs as if they were sitting in front of them, it said.\n",
      "Information about the loopholes have been passed to the makers of vulnerable mice, some of who are creating updates to make the mice more secure.\n",
      "The radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a \"dongle\" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research.\n",
      "\"That makes it possible for the attacker to send unencrypted traffic to the dongle pretending to be a keyboard and have it result as keystrokes on your computer,\" Mr Newlin said.\n",
      "By contrast, they said, signals sent by wireless keyboards were scrambled to stop attackers eavesdropping on or spoofing them.\n",
      "The pair found they could spoof signals for mice using a few lines of code and an antenna and dongle that cost $20 (Â£15).\n",
      "The attack worked at distances of up to 180m (590ft).\n",
      "Using this kit, they sent specially crafted mouse clicks that a computer interpreted as key presses, letting them run commands and take control of a target machine.\n",
      "The Bastille researchers said many companies spent a lot of time and money securing the physical devices sitting on their networks but often neglected to keep an eye on data sent via radio.\n",
      "Wireless mice produced by HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were found to be vulnerable.\n",
      "Bastille said it had reported its findings to the hardware makers and to the company that made the chipset used inside the spoofable mice.\n",
      "Updates to the internal computer code, or firmware, for some of the vulnerable mice are now being made available,\n",
      "But Bastille said many of the insecure mice it had found could not be updated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Model Summary:\n",
      "A vulnerability in wireless mice allowed attackers to spoof radio signals and control victim computers as if sitting in front of them, according to research by security firm Bastille Networks. Many wireless mice transmitted unencrypted signals to USB dongles plugged into computers. These signals acted like keystrokes, so attackers could send spoofed signals to the dongle and run commands or otherwise control the target machine. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bastille used just $20 of equipment and custom code to spoof mouse clicks that the computer saw as key presses, enabling them to control machines from up to 180 meters away. By analyzing the unencrypted radio signals from the mice, the attackers could determine how the mouse was being used, such as tracking mouse movements and clicks. They could then inject their own commands into the data stream to remotely control the target computer. For example, an attacker could use the mouse to open web browsers or applications, click on links, and even enter keystrokes to run malicious commands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many companies focus security efforts on their networks but overlook the vulnerability of unencrypted radio signal data. The researchers found wireless mice from major brands like HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were affected. Bastille responsibly disclosed the findings to the mouse makers and chipset vendors involved. Some have since released firmware updates to address the issue by adding encryption to the mice's wireless signals. However, many vulnerable wireless mice cannot be patched or updated through firmware, leaving them permanently vulnerable. So while many wireless mice can now be secured through updates, Bastille recommends users switch to wired mice or those with the latest firmware revisions if possible to avoid falling victim to this attack vector.\n",

As a result, 38 staff members were made redundant after administrators Thomson Cooper partner Richard Gardiner confirmed there was no prospect for the company to continue trading. This was described as a sad day for the Borders region by South of Scotland MSP Rachael Hamilton. However, there is some hope that some of the affected staff may find new employment at JS Crawford, a Melrose-based building firm that is in need of workers for housing projects underway. The administrators will now work to wind up Murray and Burrell's operations in an orderly fashion. Though the closure of the decades-old Murray and Burrell is certainly disappointing news, the potential for at least some former employees to quickly find new jobs in a similar field at JS Crawford, which has said they need additional staff to work on new housing projects, offers a silver lining.\n",

Organized by the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society (RUAS), the show coincided with Northern Ireland's Year of Food and Drink, prominently featuring locally-grown produce. An \"edible garden\" allowed visitors to see vegetables and fruits growing before sampling them, encouraging home cultivation. There were competitions showcasing the region's finest livestock, including pigs, cattle, chickens, and ponies. Equestrian events like show jumping and dressage demonstrations entertained crowds, along with sheep shearing contests and breeder/handler awards. The family area offered activities like falconry, gun dog skills, and a balloon artist. BBC News Northern Ireland covered the event live on social media on Wednesday. Over its long history, the Balmoral Show has become an important display of Northern Ireland's agricultural heritage and an opportunity to bring urban and rural communities together to enjoy food, farming, and family entertainment. The 148-year-old Balmoral Show, run by the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society (RUAS), has moved to the larger venue of Balmoral Park - the former site of the Maze prison - outside Lisburn in County Antrim for the past four years. Last year's event attracted over 90,000 visitors. Traditionally held at the RUAS's Belfast headquarters, the show relocated in 2013 to allow for expansion. This year's Balmoral Show coincides with Northern Ireland's Year of Food and Drink, so local produce features prominently. A highlight is the \"edible garden\" exhibiting food growing in the ground to encourage home cultivation. The event also showcases the best local livestock, with prized pigs, cattle, poultry and ponies competing to be the top animals. For younger visitors there is a family area with displays from the Northern Ireland School of Falconry, a gun dog skills demonstration and a balloon artist. BBC News NI is covering the show live on social media on Wednesday.\n",

      "Max Mosley, former head of Formula One's governing body, is suing Google for breaches of privacy laws by not blocking photos of him engaging in a sadomasochistic sex party at a rented basement flat in Chelsea. The party was secretly filmed by News of the World in a sting operation, who then published photos and video from the party. Mr. Mosley sued News of the World for breach of privacy and was awarded £60,000 in damages after a judge ruled that the story was not in the public interest and that there was no Nazi element, as the original story falsely alleged. However, years later, Mr. Mosley is now suing Google, arguing they should be required to remove the images from search results. Google contends that with the images already published, Mr. Mosley no longer has a reasonable expectation of privacy regarding them.

      "Eddie Byrne, a 28-year-old Bath-born player for the Dragons rugby team, suffered a season-ending knee injury that will cause him to miss an unspecified number of games. The exact nature of Byrne's knee injury is unknown. Byrne had made 36 appearances for the Dragons since joining the team from Wasps in 2015, though the reasons for his departure from Wasps are not stated. His career stats with the Dragons are also not provided. Byrne's absence leaves a hole in the Dragons back row that could potentially be filled by Ollie Griffiths, Harrison Keddie or James Thomas. No details are given regarding the length or value of Byrne's contract with the Dragons. It is not mentioned whether Byrne has had any previous major injuries. Before sustaining this latest knee problem, Byrne's performance for the Dragons this season had been described as \"excellent\" by coach Ceri Jones. The severity of Byrne's injury and his expected recovery time remain unclear. Ceri Jones, the Dragons' forwards coach, said Byrne's injury is a \"big blow\" because Byrne had been \"excellent all year\" and had \"really stepped up to the mark.\" However, Jones said Byrne's injury provides an opportunity for other players like Griffiths, Keddie, and Thomas to thrive in the back row. Jones specifically cited Keddie as someone who has shown \"glimpses\" of his talent this season, so this is a chance for him to step up. The Dragons will have to move forward without Byrne when they travel to play Munster in the Pro12 this coming Friday.\n",

The long-term plans of the group are not provided. Worldwide there are an unknown number of fluent Cornish speakers, estimated to be fewer than 500. The UK government says it wants to help the Cornish put down foundations like education, arts and media to secure the language's future, but does not give examples.

Despite opportunities to leave for bigger clubs following the successful 2016-17 campaign, Jardim decided to remain as Monaco's manager, with Vasilyev praising his loyalty in turning down outside offers to stick with Monaco and continue the \"adventure\" there.

      "Flooding caused significant damage and disruption across southern Scotland, particularly in Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders. The town of Newton Stewart in Dumfries and Galloway was hard hit by flooding from the overflowing River Cree, with many businesses on Victoria Street suffering damage. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited Newton Stewart to survey the aftermath. In Hawick, located in the Scottish Borders, flooding prompted repair work. The west coast mainline also faced train disruptions due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct. Constant rain triggered flood alerts across the Borders area and flooding in the town of Peebles, leading to calls for improved flood defenses. Roads were affected across the region, prompting warnings from Scottish Borders Council. Politicians Alex Rowley and Jeanette Tate visited impacted communities and argued more could have been done to prevent the flooding through infrastructure improvements and flood protection plans. Overall, the flooding caused significant damage and disruption, especially in the towns of Newton Stewart and Hawick, and sparked demands for increased flood prevention measures.\n",

      "Information about the loopholes have been passed to the makers of vulnerable mice, some of who are creating updates to make the mice more secure.\n",
      "The radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a \"dongle\" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research.\n",
      "\"That makes it possible for the attacker to send unencrypted traffic to the dongle pretending to be a keyboard and have it result as keystrokes on your computer,\" Mr Newlin said.\n",
      "By contrast, they said, signals sent by wireless keyboards were scrambled to stop attackers eavesdropping on or spoofing them.\n",
      "The pair found they could spoof signals for mice using a few lines of code and an antenna and dongle that cost $20 (Â£15).\n",
      "The attack worked at distances of up to 180m (590ft).\n",
      "Using this kit, they sent specially crafted mouse clicks that a computer interpreted as key presses, letting them run commands and take control of a target machine.\n",

Both sides made arguments in court with a ruling expected soon that could establish important precedents around privacy and the responsibilities of search engines.\n",
